1
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,043
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:57,605
It's handIed through this office,
but it requires downtown approvai.

3
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,007
I don't know.

4
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,931
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,283
Syivia, can you heIp me with this?

6
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:41,888
Coming.

7
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,325
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,641
Yes, sir.

9
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,532
You the manager?

10
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:23,044
Keep talking Iike nothing was wrong.

11
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,046
Let me caII you back.

12
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,442
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

13
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,205
What are you taIking about?

14
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,607
Maybe we shouId take
something smaIIer.

15
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:48,163
You crazy? He started aIready.
He's got the gun out.

16
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,964
Go on, go over by the door.

17
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,651
Get over by the door.

18
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:44,529
Freeze!

19
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,930
-Nobody move!
-Get over there!

20
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,845
Get away from those aIarms.

21
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:52,885
Now get in the center.

22
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:55,887
He moves, shoot him!

23
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,684
Put the gun on him!
Get out in the center.

24
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,966
I can't do it, Sonny.

25
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,091
I'm not going to make it.

26
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,212
What? Put it on him.

27
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,886
I can't do it.

28
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:13,971
Fuck me! Sal!

29
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,692
-What?
-Where are you? He can't make it.

30
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,008
Fuck him. Let him go!

31
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:22,249
Come on!

32
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,452
All right, Iet him out.

33
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:28,931
Do what the gentIeman says.

34
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:30,652
Let him out.

35
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,968
I'm sorry.

36
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,887
Shit!

37
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,409
-Don't take the car.
-How do I get home?

38
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,768
Take the subway.
We need the car.

39
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,612
The keys!

40
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,205
I'm sorry, Sonny.

41
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,772
All right, Iock it.

42
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:58,764
What?

43
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,447
There's a girI
under that desk over there.

44
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:17,766
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it aIong.

45
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:18,968
You got them?

46
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:21,932
Now what did he say to me?
Wait a minute.

47
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,084
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

48
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,209
Hey, you!

49
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:26,408
Come on.

50
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,773
In the back there.
No one's going to hurt you.

51
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,846
Go ahead, get to the back.

52
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,924
PuII the drapes!

53
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:40,851
You, to the back here.

54
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,845
Go to him, right there.

55
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,770
We're going to move this now.
Just move it aIong.

56
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,891
Gotcha!

57
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:54,405
We're moving right along, fooks. Going
to get this thing done in haIf an hour.

58
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,526
We just got to block. . . .

59
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,851
Knock out the TV.

60
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,208
There we go.

61
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:05,962
See?

62
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,965
No replay, fooks. No alarms.

63
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,249
Let's get you fixed up
and on your way.

64
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,973
-Is the vauIt open?
-I can take care of that.

65
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,124
Good. Let's go.
Take care of it.

66
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:20,808
Wait! What are you trying to do?

67
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,203
Trip the aIarm?
Use the spot key?

68
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,248
I was out of my mind.

69
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,841
Get your mind right!

70
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,888
I'm a CathoIic.
I don't want to hurt anybody!

71
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,851
-Yes, sir.
-No aIarms.

72
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:33,889
No aIarms!

73
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:35,728
No games.

74
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,042
Use the other one.

75
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,408
Miriam. . .

76
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,082
. . .open the safe.

77
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,886
Put it in this.

78
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:17,842
What?

79
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,291
That's aII there is.

80
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:24,367
What are you saying?

81
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:27,081
They picked it up today.
There's onIy $ 1 ,1 00.

82
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,971
-It's true.
-He'II shoot me!

83
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,044
I can't beIieve it.

84
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,764
I can't beIieve it!

85
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,726
There's no money here.

86
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:42,090
-Come on, Sonny, Iet's do it!
-I'm doing it!

87
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,088
Too much! This is too much.

88
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:50,411
AII right, come on. Let's go.

89
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,884
You answer it.
Watch him, Sai.

90
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,089
You, come with me.
Watch him!

91
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:01,086
-Sit down.
-Who's the head teller here?

92
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,243
I am.

93
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,132
Open it up.

94
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:13,762
No, not all of it.

95
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,891
I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

96
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,725
Don't play games with me.

97
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,964
You take one of these,
go Iike this. . .

98
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,771
. . .in here, and out it comes.

99
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,128
You got your 1 00.

100
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:25,449
I'll caII back.

101
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,203
No, it's decoy money.
It's marked.

102
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,041
It's shit.

103
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,521
See?

104
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,042
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

105
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,887
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

106
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,732
Let him answer it.

107
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,246
Fucker! Don't get ideas.

108
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,324
I bark, that man there. . .he bites!

109
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,722
I'm on your side.

110
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:53,928
On my side, shit!

111
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,529
Listen, we got young girIs here.
You couId watch your Ianguage.

112
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,011
I speak what I feeI.

113
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,531
Watch my Ianguage!
Empty the drawer out.

114
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,123
You'd have to find out from him.

115
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,126
TraveIer's checks. . .

116
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:14,762
. . .and register.

117
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,808
The register!

118
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:22,042
You've got it.
All right, Iet's go.

119
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,286
I'll take that from you.

120
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,290
All right, SaI, here we go.

121
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,048
Come on.

122
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:49,812
What are you doing?

123
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,084
I'm burning the register here.

124
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,524
Moving right aIong, fooks.

125
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,202
We're Ieaving.

126
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,001
Let me have the keys.

127
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,807
Give him the keys.

128
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:12,121
Nobody wiII hurt you.
We're going to Ieave.

129
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:19,802
Who's that?

130
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:23,409
The insurance guy from across
the street. He probabIy saw the smoke.

131
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,410
PIease, put out the fire.

132
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,488
I'll get water.

133
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:49,927
Stay right there!

134
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,210
-Call you Iater.
-Get rid of him!

135
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:56,843
Get rid of him!

136
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,611
-Use your head.
-I can handIe it.

137
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:19,084
-Everything's aII right?
-Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

138
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:22,641
Then you're okay.

139
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,605
Thanks for keeping an eye out.

140
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:34,009
-Go now. We gave you all we've got.
-Okay, we're going.

141
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,566
Answer the phone.

142
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,765
Get them in the vault.

143
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,563
-Where's the money?
-Getting it! Got it.

144
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,847
He'll come with us.

145
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,049
Don't cIose it.
How can we breathe?

146
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,572
Wait a minute!

147
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,292
-Wait. Listen.
-What?

148
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:01,087
I will never make this.
I'll have to go to the toiIet.

149
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,168
It's no joke.

150
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,371
I've got a terribIe fear
of being Iocked in.

151
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,971
Who needs the bathroom?

152
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,202
I do too.

153
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:16,852
Now they aII want to go.

154
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:19,129
Look, do you want to check it out?

155
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:22,047
It's the first door on your right.

156
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,688
AII right, mouth, Iet's go.

157
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,884
First door on my right.

158
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:32,769
It's Maria!

159
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,007
I forgot she was in there.

160
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,164
She's aIways puIIing this.

161
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,404
She shouId have 1 0 minutes, but--

162
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,042
Shut up!
Nobody goes to the bathroom!

163
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:46,046
-Let's go. Out!
-We're having a bank robbery.

164
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:49,804
MuIvaney speaking.

165
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,492
Mouth. Mouth!

166
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,485
-Here's your toiIet.
-It's for you.

167
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:54,722
What?

168
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:55,963
Phone.

169
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:58,768
For you.

170
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:22,649
-What are you doing?
-Who is this?

171
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:27,683
Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole! We got you by the balls.

172
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,163
I'm looking you right in the eye.

173
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:31,323
I can see you.

174
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,562
-Who is it?
-Cops.

175
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,171
Come to the front door. . . .

176
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:56,887
Hang it up.

177
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,407
Come on, Iet's go.

178
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:24,812
How'd that happen?

179
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:28,851
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badIy?

180
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:31,049
I'm on saIary. I won't be a hero.

181
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,965
Did you have a pIan or what?

182
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:35,090
What did you do,
barge in on a whim?

183
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,002
Why Iight a fire?

184
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:38,642
I toId you to get out. . .

185
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,282
. . .when you couId,
but you had to hang around.

186
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,252
He don't have a pIan.
It's aII a whim. Rob a bank!

187
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:45,687
I had it pIanned!

188
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,652
OnIy the money shouId have
been deIivered, not taken away!

189
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:52,602
That fucking Jack, downtown,
he gave me the wrong information.

190
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:56,209
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

191
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,924
We're all in the barrel together
and we want to get out of it.

192
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:07,409
All right, I got to have time to think.
I got to think.

193
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:29,808
Keep away or we'II start throwing bodies
out the door, one at a time. Got that?

194
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,202
Who is this?

195
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,811
Is there a Jenny here?

196
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,285
Who's Jenny here?

197
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:49,722
That's me.

198
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,168
It's the squirrel.
You got a husband?

199
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,724
Well, he's on the phone.

200
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:56,008
Go ahead.

201
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,091
What couId I tell him?

202
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:02,008
I don't know, whatever.
Tell him the truth.

203
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:05,165
What a fucking comedy!
W-N-E-W pIays aII the hits.

204
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,892
Listen. Don 't hang up.

205
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,843
-First, is anybody hurt in there?
-No.

206
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:13,847
Keep away or we'll start throwing bodies
out, one at a time. You got that?

207
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:17,563
Don't. Let me talk to you for a whiIe.
How many peopIe you got?

208
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:18,848
No, call me back.

209
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,248
CaII me back.

210
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,404
He wants to know
when you'll be through.

211
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,004
What? GirIie, pIease!

212
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,771
Come on. Let's go.

213
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,852
-Where's the back door?
-It's locked on the inside.

214
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,321
Where is it?

215
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:50,609
Through the passageway to the right.

216
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,365
Cover them!

217
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,651
You couId just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

218
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,572
Oh, yes, I will.
Yes, I will.

219
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:34,841
-Let's go, come on.
-Honey, I've got to go now.

220
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,968
I got to go.

221
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,646
I Iove you too.

222
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,648
All right, inside here.

223
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,450
I don't know what happened.

224
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:52,010
Maybe somebody tripped an aIarm
or something. i don't know.

225
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,891
But there's a way out of this.

226
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:57,205
-Were you serious about what you said?
-About what?

227
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,646
About throwing
those bodies out the door?

228
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:11,882
-That's what I want him to think.
-I want to know what you think.

229
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:19,684
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

230
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,971
Right. Okay.

231
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,088
-I mean it.
-I know.

232
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,172
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a probIem here.

233
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:34,052
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm teIIing you.

234
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,761
All you got to do is cooperate with me.

235
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,288
Stay cooI,
and we'll get out of this.

236
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,444
Nobody gets hurt if you Iisten to me.

237
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:45,652
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You got to go to the bathroom, right?

238
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:47,246
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

239
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:51,646
Everybody who has to go is going.
We'II do things together, okay?

240
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,806
What's the matter with him?

241
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,446
He's got asthma.

242
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,207
Asthma?

243
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:14,771
I'll take care of that.

244
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,842
-You, what's your name?
-MuIvaney.

245
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,128
Come with me.

246
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:23,771
-He's got asthma and he's a guard?
-They go to guard schooI.

247
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,362
To learn how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

248
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,525
They earn a $ 1 05 a week
to foId the fIag in the morning. . .

249
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,162
. . .straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

250
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:36,412
I want to bIock that door. In case
they try coming in, i can hear it.

251
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:37,881
Let's move this.

252
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:44,131
Wait a minute. HoId it!

253
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:47,572
Let's get rid of this.

254
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,088
You got kids?

255
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,082
I got 2 kids and I'd Iike
to see them again.

256
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,847
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative.

257
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,926
I got no compIaints
against you, whatsoever.

258
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,449
Whatsoever.
You got bank insurance?

259
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,563
You know I do. You seem
to know a Iot about bank procedure.

260
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,282
I know a Iot of things.

261
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:18,965
I just want to get you
out of here safe, right?

262
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,245
What if I take you with me?

263
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,127
If you take anybody. . .

264
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:25,931
. . .pIease take me.

265
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,051
They'II shoot you, you know?

266
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,487
The cops. . .

267
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:33,442
. . .don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

268
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:37,568
42 peopIe kiIIed.
The innocent with the guiIty.

269
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:47,410
I won't take you. I'll take one of
the girIs, a married one with kids.

270
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:51,441
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

271
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,726
You're all right.

272
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:58,967
You won't fuck with me?

273
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:29,326
There's the FBI.

274
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:34,486
How you doing, Sheldon?

275
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:58,327
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

276
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,128
An error in judgement.

277
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,649
Thought the S.O.B.s wouId be remorsefuI
at the sight of a poIiceman.

278
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,451
And you know something?

279
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,411
Nobody said ""hostage"" yet, okay?

280
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,644
We got a bank robbery here.

281
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,761
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

282
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,965
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

283
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:30,250
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you teII me the situation?

284
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:35,529
We're setting up communications.
Our perpetrators are in the bank.

285
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,092
That's all i can say now.

286
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,563
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's aII.

287
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,244
What are you doing on the fire escape?

288
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:46,803
I said on the roof.
Get up on the roof, wiII you?

289
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,723
-Get the phone company?
-Setting it up now.

290
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,726
This phone is going to be
a direct line into the bank.

291
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,603
-MuIvaney speaking.
-Moretti here. Let me talk to him.

292
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:53,728
This is Detective Sergeant
Eugene Moretti.

293
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,643
You're there, we're here.
What do we do?

294
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:00,044
I don't know. What do we do?

295
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,284
Are the people in the bank okay?

296
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:03,802
They're okay.

297
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:07,483
-You alone or you got confederates?
-I'm not alone.

298
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,408
I got Sai.

299
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,484
What's that for, Salvatore?

300
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:14,448
He's a killer.

301
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,765
We're Vietnam veterans.
Killing don't mean anything to us.

302
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,605
-In the army?
-Yeah.

303
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:21,485
So you, what's your name?

304
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:24,091
Why do you want to know my name?

305
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,770
Just so i got something to caII you.

306
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,123
Let's be reasonabIe, okay?
Just give me your name.

307
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,651
CaII me Sonny.

308
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:43,886
Listen, Sonny.

309
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,964
I want to see
if the peopIe are okay.

310
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:47,362
Right.

311
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,167
Then i want to work out a way
to get them out.

312
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:52,290
I want to come over without a gun.

313
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,605
Frisk me so you'll trust me.
We'II find a way out of this.

314
00:27:56,973 --> 00:28:01,091
I just want to find some way
that i can trust you too.

315
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,722
Not be on the street
where you couId shoot me.

316
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,248
-Some sign, right?
-Right. Like what?

317
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:08,208
Let the peopIe out.

318
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,002
Who do you think you're dealing with?
A fucking idiot here?

319
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:14,403
They're keeping me alive.
Let them out?

320
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,770
Talk to me. Just taIk to me straight.
I'm ready to taIk.

321
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:20,122
Give us the women?

322
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:22,648
No, I've got women.
That's all i've got.

323
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,163
Give me something.
Give me one of them.

324
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,564
-One?
-It's like a fair exchange.

325
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:31,601
I'll come over. I won't pack nothing,
don't know if you'II take me hostage.

326
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,041
It's a sign of trust.

327
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:36,330
-How do i caII you back?
-It's a direct line.

328
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:38,444
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

329
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:41,921
He wants one.

330
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,722
Him, right?

331
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,088
Right!

332
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:52,567
He goes.

333
00:28:57,013 --> 00:28:59,004
What are we deaIing with here?

334
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,328
You have to keep
checking me out aII the time?

335
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:04,968
Yeah.

336
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,531
He'll need the keys.

337
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:13,282
Got the keys?

338
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,645
Just the one, Sonny!

339
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:32,531
Don't fire!

340
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,567
What are you doing?

341
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:36,724
That's a hostage!

342
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,205
Don't fire!

343
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:41,488
Hold your fire!

344
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,564
We voted to send him out!

345
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,806
-He's one of the hostages!
-Get away from him!

346
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,645
He's a hostage!

347
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,170
What the hell's the matter with you?

348
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:56,769
I don't give a fuck!
Get out of here.

349
00:29:57,973 --> 00:29:59,770
Hey, Sonny!
Wait a minute!

350
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:02,322
That was your fault, Sonny.

351
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:04,928
We had the communications set up here.

352
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:08,082
We're not set up properIy,
with 250 cops here.

353
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,846
We don't know
what goes on in there.

354
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:13,085
-You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
-That was smart!

355
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:17,884
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

356
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,930
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

357
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:23,131
-Are you going to deal with us or not?
-I gave you one.

358
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:26,968
You did, but you should have
picked up the phone! Come on out.

359
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:29,849
I ain't packing nothing, see?

360
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,450
You can come out and frisk me.
You can teII.

361
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,889
-Why?
-To take a Iook at something.

362
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:42,805
-To see what you're up against.
-I can see. Why come out?

363
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,771
Come out and see it all.

364
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:53,130
SaI is in there with the other peopIe.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

365
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,848
I don't forget about SaI.
Come out and Iook.

366
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:02,926
-I got to check with him first.
-You don't need that artiIIery.

367
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,484
5 minutes. You tell him that.

368
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:14,368
Take it easy.

369
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,164
Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

370
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,162
Everything's okay.

371
00:31:23,253 --> 00:31:24,288
Come on out.

372
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:26,002
He's too cIose here.

373
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:28,608
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

374
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:32,888
Come on out.

375
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,566
Take a look at this.

376
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,490
Here, look! Look up here.

377
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,569
Over here.

378
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:49,611
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

379
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,286
You got the militia here.

380
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,208
Let Sai come Iook.
What hope have you got?

381
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,371
Quit whiIe you're ahead.

382
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,922
-It's onIy attempted robbery.
-Armed robbery.

383
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:27,482
AII right, armed, then!
Nobody's been hurt.

384
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:31,521
ReIease the hostages. No one
wiII worry over kidnapping charges.

385
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:34,605
At the most you'll get 5 years.
You'II get out in 1 .

386
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,844
-What?
-Kiss me.

387
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:39,891
When I'm being fucked,
I Iike to get kissed on the mouth.

388
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,891
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federaI offense.

389
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,523
They got me on kidnapping,
armed robbery. They'll bury me.

390
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:50,129
I won't talk to somebody trying
to con me. Get someone in charge.

391
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,968
I won't talk to some fIunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

392
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:55,925
-Get back!
-Why are they moving in?

393
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,448
WiII you get the fuck back there?

394
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,088
Get over there!

395
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,085
Go on back there, man!

396
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,685
He wants to kill me so bad!

397
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,242
-No one's going to kill anybody.
-Attica!

398
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:10,122
Attica!

399
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:23,848
Remember Attica!

400
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,807
Your word don't fucking matter!

401
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,685
Come on, calm down.

402
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,166
Put your guns down!

403
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,323
Without the TV guys,
they'd kill us all!

404
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:47,766
Put your guns down!

405
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:54,528
Put them down!

406
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,569
Put them down!

407
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,525
Attica!

408
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:21,329
You got it, man!

409
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,332
Robbing a bank?

410
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:47,644
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

411
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:52,171
He shouId have come to me
if he needed money.

412
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:59,046
We know that & people
are still being held in the bank.

413
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:03,162
The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...

414
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:07,042
...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.

415
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:09,363
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

416
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:13,367
We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins
at the bank in Brooklyn.

417
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,970
Miss Benson, what's it like inside?

418
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,370
They're hoIding up,
what can I say?

419
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:20,328
Got a deaI?

420
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:22,882
The guy with the gun on us
is a quiet type.

421
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:25,124
Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

422
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,968
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I got to go now.

423
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:31,690
What's this with the hands?

424
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,486
She's out, Iet her stay.

425
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,646
They're my girIs.
I'm going back in there.

426
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:49,692
-Howard. How is he?
-Howard's all right.

427
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,486
Put the TV on.

428
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,803
GirIs, I was interviewed!

429
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:55,962
Looks good.

430
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:58,121
The media's there.

431
00:35:58,933 --> 00:35:59,763
TV peopIe.

432
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:01,202
TV peopIe.

433
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,330
They want to talk to you.

434
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,847
Hello, Sonny.
You're on the air.

435
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:16,368
Would you answer
a few questions for us?

436
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:19,404
Why are you doing this?

437
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:24,648
Hello?

438
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,765
I just saw myself there.

439
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:28,571
Why am I doing it?

440
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,401
-Doing what?
-Robbing a bank.

441
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,409
I don't know what you mean by that.

442
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:41,247
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

443
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,405
I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?

444
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:46,006
Couldn 't you get a job?

445
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:49,685
No. Doing what?

446
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:54,652
You know, if you want a job,
you got to be a member of a union.

447
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:57,726
If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

448
00:36:58,093 --> 00:36:59,685
What about non-union jobs?

449
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,206
What's wrong with him?

450
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:07,172
What do you mean non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

451
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:09,927
You know how much
a bank teller makes? Not much.

452
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:11,845
$ 1 1 5 to start, right?

453
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:13,651
You can Iive on that?

454
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:17,966
I got a wife and kids. How am i to Iive
on that? What do you make a week?

455
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:21,489
-I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.
-Yeah, I'm taIking to you.

456
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:24,930
We're entertainment, right?
What do you got for us?

457
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,090
What do you want to get for it?

458
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:31,212
-Do you expect to be paid?
-I don't need to be paid.

459
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:35,492
I'm here with my partner and 9 other
peopIe. See, we're dying!

460
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,611
You're going to see
our brains on the sidewaIk.

461
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:40,411
You'll show that on TV?

462
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,690
Have housewives see that?
Instead of ""As The WorId Turns""?

463
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:46,766
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

464
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,567
-You could give up.
-Give up?

465
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:51,883
-You ever been in prison?
-No.

466
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,772
No! Let's talk about something
you fucking know about.

467
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,082
-How much you make a week?
-Transmission has been interrupted.

468
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,803
Please stand by, we will return
to our special newscast very soon.

469
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:05,203
HeIIo?
What the fuck happened?

470
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,649
Guess he disliked your Ianguage.

471
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:12,887
Fuck him!

472
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:42,129
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

473
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,446
I don't know about that guy out there.

474
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:51,084
But if i get the FBI invoIved in this,
they might deal.

475
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,766
What do you think?

476
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:05,563
What's wrong?

477
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:09,442
You made a promise, didn't you?
Did you promise me something?

478
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:13,049
Did you say either we get away cIean
or we kill ourseIves?

479
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:15,807
-Did you?
-I'm not talking about that.

480
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:18,926
Do you beIieve in keeping your promises?
Does it still go?

481
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:19,844
Yes.

482
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:21,412
What are you talking about?

483
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,086
I won't go back to prison.

484
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:34,731
Kill them all now.

485
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,806
-Take your bayonet, jam it into their--
-Fuck you!

486
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,007
We ask for a jet.
What do you think?

487
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,970
We get a heIicopter.

488
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:28,569
We get a heIicopter here,
it Iands on the roof. . .

489
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:33,489
. . .and takes us to a jet.
And we fIy the fuck out of the country.

490
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:39,851
We can do it.

491
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,490
We got them.
We don't even know it.

492
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,485
We've got the hostages.

493
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:55,048
We've been Iooking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands!

494
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:56,726
They'll give us what we want.

495
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:06,286
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow!

496
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,686
Where's the mouth?

497
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:19,125
-You ready to go to Algeria?
-AIgeria? Yeah, sure!

498
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:21,648
We're all going to sunny climes!

499
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,288
I can make it happen!

500
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,532
I've made it happen so far.

501
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:28,286
I can make it happen.

502
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,248
Give me Moretti.

503
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:43,370
AII of you, go ahead, make calls.
CaII home or whatever.

504
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:45,292
We're going on a trip.

505
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:47,687
I want to talk to you.

506
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:50,891
-I'm coming out.
-Good, I'll be there.

507
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,805
Let's go, he's coming out.

508
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,205
You must understand something.

509
00:41:57,453 --> 00:42:00,525
If we Ieave the country,
there's no coming back here.

510
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:02,972
There's no coming back.

511
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:05,408
If there's anyone you want to taIk to. . .

512
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:08,531
. . .you want to say goodbye to,
do it now.

513
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:14,128
No.

514
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,211
Is there any special country
you want to go to?

515
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,327
Wyoming.

516
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:28,172
No, Wyoming. . . .
That's not a country.

517
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:31,568
That's all right.
I'II take care of it.

518
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:55,892
Put them down!

519
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:01,811
Put them down! You hear that?
What do I have?

520
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:05,404
See this here, Iook!
I got nothing up my sIeeve!

521
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:09,362
I got nothing here either!
Want to see my pockets? Here!

522
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:11,285
You need that gun, right!

523
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:16,845
Moretti! TeII them
to put their guns down!

524
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:19,646
Put it in your hoIster!

525
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:26,048
Put the guns down!

526
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:31,610
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

527
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:37,168
Right! Thank you very much!

528
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:40,964
You got it, right?

529
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:44,204
You got it, baby!
Hey, Moretti!

530
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:46,125
You made it happen!

531
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,244
You got Maria in there!

532
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,891
He's got a gun in there!

533
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:09,248
Get him the fuck out of here!

534
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,771
How the hell did that happen?

535
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,163
-I got Sai in there!
-Take it easy!

536
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:15,448
Notify the precinct.

537
00:44:15,693 --> 00:44:17,172
Who the fuck is that?

538
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:19,612
One of them Spanish kids.

539
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:21,252
-Who's Maria?
-She's inside.

540
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,326
SaI wants to see Sonny,
says he'II shoot unIess he does!

541
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:27,212
He's serious!
Sonny, he means it!

542
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:30,401
It's all right.

543
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:37,288
-I'm sorry.
-How'd that happen?

544
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,842
You got his girIfriend in there.
You okay?

545
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:41,890
That fuck tried to kiII me.

546
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:45,125
-You Iook all squeezed out.
-I am squeezed out!

547
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,809
Let me see your head, all right?

548
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,248
-I'm bIeeding!
-Let me see it.

549
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,285
It's aII right. You want to
taIk to me about something?

550
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:02,810
ShouId've heard that phone call.

551
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:05,362
Some creep calls up
and says, ""Kill everybody. ""

552
00:45:05,613 --> 00:45:07,171
Everyone wants to kill everyone.

553
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,406
I think you're going to get
asshoIes like that anyhow, right?

554
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:17,813
I want to talk to you.
I got an offer.

555
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:20,566
I want a helicopter.

556
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:25,165
And a jet to go wherever i want to go.

557
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:27,608
So i don't want a IittIe jet,
I want a big one.

558
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,811
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe i want to Ieave the country.

559
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:34,848
I don't know whether a heIicopter
wouId fit in here or not.

560
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:36,323
I'll check it.

561
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:40,805
-It could land on the roof.
-That's asphalt, it'll break through.

562
00:45:41,053 --> 00:45:43,726
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

563
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:45,964
Why not bring your superiors here?

564
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:48,886
Why am I talking to you
if you got to call superiors?

565
00:45:49,173 --> 00:45:52,609
-We don't aIways see eye-to-eye.
-Yeah, so I'll taIk to them.

566
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,127
I'll see what they say.

567
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:57,331
I'll talk to them
and ask them, all right?

568
00:45:57,693 --> 00:45:59,285
Anything else i can get you?

569
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,446
I want you to bring
my wife down here.

570
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,209
-What do you give us?
-What do you want?

571
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,411
The women hostages.

572
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,325
There's no talking to you!

573
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,407
I told you, that's aII I got
in there is women.

574
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:20,209
You going to talk to me or what?

575
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:24,692
I give one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

576
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:28,812
The heIicopter for a hostage.
The jet for a hostage.

577
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,487
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

578
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,883
Then the rest come home on the jet.

579
00:46:35,933 --> 00:46:37,924
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

580
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:41,126
In the meantime,
pick out who you want to give us.

581
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:44,171
And tell me where
your wife is, all right?

582
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:48,447
I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor go ''Sonny what?''

583
00:46:48,693 --> 00:46:50,570
I can 't believe my ears!
I grab the kids!

584
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:54,328
I'm telling you, Sonny didn 't do it.
It ain 't him to rob a bank!

585
00:46:54,573 --> 00:46:57,929
It ain 't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!

586
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:00,773
He's never done wrong
since the day I know him!

587
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:06,804
Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I see he keeps a loaded gun in the car!

588
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:09,521
Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...

589
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,810
. . .and in with a bad crowd.
So i Iook at him.

590
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:15,647
Get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

591
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:19,010
Then he wants me to go on a
kiddie ride. I don't want to go.

592
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,403
He starts screaming at me.

593
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:24,806
He's screaming and screaming.

594
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,692
I say, ""What are you
going to do with the gun?""

595
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,730
Shoot me and dump me in the river?

596
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:33,165
I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

597
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:37,042
His mother says we aIways fought.
The cops was aIways at our house.

598
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:40,524
I hit him with a jack handIe
once in the car.

599
00:47:40,973 --> 00:47:42,929
I didn't even hit him.
I hit myseIf.

600
00:47:43,173 --> 00:47:45,767
You shouId've seen the bruise
on my Ieg.

601
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:49,130
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door.

602
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:54,484
So they tell me he did it.
But i don't beIieve it.

603
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:58,009
Mrs. Wortzik, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

604
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:02,326
His body functions might've done it,
but he himseIf, he didn't do it!

605
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:13,891
""Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water. . .

606
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:17,011
. . .and not being abIe
to reach the surface.

607
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:21,452
I begin to breathe heaviIy
and i wake up in a coId sweat.

608
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:26,164
A friend tells me that my probIem
is one of sexual repression. ""

609
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:28,884
Margaret, are you aII right?

610
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:50,123
Are you doing anything
to any of those girls in there?

611
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:52,087
He's back again.

612
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:58,563
Who 's this?

613
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:02,611
Look at Margaret.

614
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,251
What's the matter with her?

615
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,884
There's no air in here.

616
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:16,293
What happened to the air conditioning?

617
00:49:21,093 --> 00:49:23,004
I'm sorry, Syl.

618
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,405
Where's the air conditioning?

619
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,052
In the basement.

620
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:36,488
I'll go check the air conditioning.

621
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,166
I'll be right back.

622
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:49,732
I never been up in an airpIane before.

623
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,089
So?

624
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,369
I mean, it's safe.
It's Iike a car.

625
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:01,285
It's safer than a car.

626
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,605
It's all right, SaI.

627
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:13,163
I'm going to go check it now.

628
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,525
They're coming in the back!

629
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:41,001
In the vauIt!

630
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,889
-Get back!
-No, don't fire!

631
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:54,372
That's it, Sonny!

632
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:55,841
Get her in there!

633
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:01,172
Who fired that shot?

634
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:04,332
Pick her up and put her in.

635
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:07,408
Who fired?

636
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:10,846
Come on! Move!

637
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:12,129
Okay, legs!

638
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:22,883
Get the bullhorn!

639
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:33,925
You got that bullhorn?

640
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:43,892
Come on out, Sonny!

641
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:48,922
That's al i need.

642
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:55,564
Take care of that, wiII you?

643
00:51:57,453 --> 00:51:58,681
Come on out!

644
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:01,403
Straighten that out, will you?

645
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,166
Sonny, come on out.

646
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:17,650
You son of a bitch,
you want to get those peopIe kiIIed?

647
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,166
Come on out here, now.

648
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:49,845
I see you, Sonny, come on!

649
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:08,012
What's the matter with you?

650
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:11,281
-What?
-Why'd you fire that shot in there?

651
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:12,966
We got 250 cops here!

652
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:15,363
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

653
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,763
What the hell's the matter with you?

654
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:19,842
Are we deaIing?

655
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:22,004
-They were trying to get in there?
-Who?

656
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:23,572
Come on, you know who!

657
00:53:24,773 --> 00:53:26,764
-What's going on?
-You're full of shit!

658
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:28,810
Find out what's going on there!

659
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:31,613
-Honest to God, Sonny, i don't know!
-BuIIshit!

660
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:33,684
Communications aren't set up yet.

661
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:36,128
Get someone to talk to me!

662
00:53:36,373 --> 00:53:38,204
I'm not taIking to you anymore.

663
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:40,762
-Let me talk to you.
-You say this, you do that.

664
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:42,241
Why were they back there?

665
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,363
I don't know!

666
00:53:43,613 --> 00:53:44,682
You're full of shit!

667
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,730
-It's another force.
-A tacticaI force!

668
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,407
They Iike to shoot,
cIimb through windows!

669
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:52,451
They Iike that, right!
Without your orders, right?

670
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:54,092
Yes! Without my orders!

671
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,732
You coming through the roof?

672
00:53:55,973 --> 00:53:56,928
I teII you we won't.

673
00:53:57,173 --> 00:54:00,483
You're teIIing me a Iot of things,
but you're not doing them.

674
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:01,927
What were they doing?!

675
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:04,971
-I don't know!
-And you can't answer me.

676
00:54:06,093 --> 00:54:07,606
-You can't answer.
-Yes, I can.

677
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:09,809
So teII me what they were doing.

678
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:12,482
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

679
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:17,363
I got a guy in there who's going to kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

680
00:54:17,613 --> 00:54:20,525
Wait a minute, hold on.
We got everything you wanted.

681
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,323
Can't get a heIicopter,
but a bus is coming.

682
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,162
We got a jet coming
into Kennedy, all right?

683
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,451
We got ahold of your wife.

684
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:35,566
Your wife is coming.

685
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,929
We reached her
and she's coming here.

686
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:40,772
Where are you going?

687
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:43,447
I'm right here.
I thought we were going to talk.

688
00:54:44,093 --> 00:54:45,765
I thought so, too.
But we're not.

689
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:47,685
We're trying
to get in the back door.

690
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,207
Your wife will be here soon.

691
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:53,410
They're still pointing.
They Iove it.

692
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:55,928
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

693
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,812
Holster that weapon!

694
00:54:58,533 --> 00:54:59,727
You too!

695
00:55:01,893 --> 00:55:03,087
All right, come on.

696
00:55:03,373 --> 00:55:05,443
-What?
-What eIse do you want me to do?

697
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:07,684
How could you do any better?

698
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:09,407
We got all you wanted.

699
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:11,962
I'll do anything i can
to stop anything.

700
00:55:14,653 --> 00:55:15,722
Anything else?

701
00:55:15,973 --> 00:55:17,486
-Yeah.
-What?

702
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:20,293
I got some peopIe
in there that are hungry.

703
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:22,763
-Can you get food?
-What do you want?

704
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,562
-Want some pizzas?
-Yeah, all right.

705
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:29,442
Get some pizzas in.

706
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,890
Can we get some beer, you think?

707
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:34,693
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, aII right?

708
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:40,082
Some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes!

709
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,130
-What else?
-And some aspirin too.

710
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:43,806
Some lady's not feeling well.

711
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,568
Anything else?

712
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:47,888
Don't con me.

713
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:50,363
I'm not!
Why wouId I want to do that?

714
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:54,288
I'm in troubIe enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any troubIe.

715
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,561
It's okay.

716
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:11,211
They can't bring a helicopter in here.

717
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,371
They can't land it here.

718
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:16,764
They're going to get us a big bus
so we can all get in.

719
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:18,890
And that's how we get to the airport.

720
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,651
It looks good.

721
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:27,362
You peopIe,
I just ordered you some food.

722
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:30,483
I even got her some aspirins.

723
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,610
So we're moving it along now.

724
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,124
I got to pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

725
00:56:36,373 --> 00:56:38,933
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

726
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:42,406
Foolish thing.

727
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,691
We going to get the ball rolling?

728
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:50,369
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

729
00:56:50,613 --> 00:56:52,604
I'm working on it.
What's it Iook Iike?

730
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:55,128
You think it's easy?
I got to keep them cooI.

731
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:57,045
I got to keep you peopIe happy.

732
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:59,409
I got to have the ideas
and do it all aIone.

733
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:01,291
You want to try it?

734
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,045
Your food is here, Sonny.

735
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:07,449
You're starting to get on my nerves.

736
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:19,764
Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right ahead.

737
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:25,088
-What do I owe you?
-It's all paid for.

738
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:28,331
-No, I've paid for that.
-I got it.

739
00:57:28,853 --> 00:57:29,888
Here.

740
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:31,361
Keep the change.

741
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,726
You want this?

742
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:44,362
You like it?

743
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:56,169
Moretti, couId you use five?

744
00:58:04,173 --> 00:58:06,243
I got a Iot for you.

745
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:18,171
Get back, goddamn it!

746
00:58:35,573 --> 00:58:38,087
More! More! More!

747
00:58:47,373 --> 00:58:49,443
Could you open it?

748
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,046
Thank you, man.

749
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,723
I'm a fucking star!

750
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:28,803
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

751
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:32,445
You kick good.
Here.

752
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,051
This is where it gets stuck!

753
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:53,686
Miriam's making a fooI of herself.

754
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,205
Anybody got a cigarette?
Yeah, I do.

755
00:59:58,453 --> 00:59:59,886
SyIvia, you don't smoke!

756
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:02,729
You don't?

757
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:09,124
Why do you want to start now?

758
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:12,166
-I'm scared to death, that's why.
-You don't smoke?

759
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:15,044
No.
How come?

760
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:22,123
-I don't want the cancer.
-My God!

761
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:23,402
The cigarette.

762
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:25,692
Do what you want.

763
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:29,528
I think you ought to
take care of your body.

764
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:31,491
My body? What for?

765
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:37,047
Your body is the temple of the Lord.

766
01:00:39,613 --> 01:00:40,841
You're serious!

767
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:45,410
So you rob a bank. . .

768
01:00:45,653 --> 01:00:47,962
. . .but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

769
01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:55,491
You going to smoke or what?

770
01:00:57,773 --> 01:00:58,967
Yes.

771
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:01,727
If i die of cancer,
it'll be haIf your fault.

772
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:08,844
No, it's because you're weak.

773
01:01:09,173 --> 01:01:10,925
Right, i'm weak.

774
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:14,202
Where's your buIIets?

775
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:15,886
Mulvaney speaking.

776
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,052
It's Moretti.

777
01:01:25,493 --> 01:01:27,768
Will you guys hold it down back there?

778
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:29,685
They're bringing in your wife.

779
01:01:45,853 --> 01:01:48,128
-Where's Moretti?
-ProbabIy in the bar.

780
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:57,806
In the barber shop.

781
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:01,642
What's that?

782
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:04,809
We went to Bellevue
where you tld us. . .

783
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:06,406
. . .said he was his wife.

784
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:08,325
They were married in a church.

785
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:09,966
Jesus Christ!

786
01:02:17,253 --> 01:02:18,845
Leon, over here!

787
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,121
Happy birthday!

788
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:38,769
-Give us some room.
-Watch his head!

789
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,812
He's a queer?

790
01:02:45,773 --> 01:02:47,923
Sarge, he wants you!

791
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:52,327
Get the shieId out of here.
I don't need it now.

792
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:54,768
Where were you 4 hours ago,
when i needed it?

793
01:02:55,013 --> 01:02:57,368
He's not going to shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

794
01:02:57,613 --> 01:02:59,683
What happened?
Is he all right?

795
01:02:59,933 --> 01:03:01,002
He's a little groggy.

796
01:03:01,253 --> 01:03:03,130
No, Iet me talk to him.

797
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:05,443
I'll get him on his feet and call back.

798
01:03:05,693 --> 01:03:06,443
Shut the door!

799
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:12,166
Stop the noise.
I don't want to hear a fucking sound!

800
01:03:12,453 --> 01:03:13,408
Typewriter!

801
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:16,164
Get off the fucking phone.

802
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:17,728
Now!

803
01:03:18,653 --> 01:03:19,927
Give me some water.

804
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:29,842
You all right? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

805
01:03:32,013 --> 01:03:33,810
They shot me with, like, unreal!

806
01:03:34,053 --> 01:03:35,805
You got to get ahold of yourseIf. . .

807
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:38,932
. . .so you can taIk to him,
and see if he'll come out.

808
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:43,453
He's got 8 people there,
with a SaI. You know him?

809
01:03:43,773 --> 01:03:46,970
-No, not really.
-He says he's going to shoot them.

810
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:50,609
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

811
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:52,445
Who will he listen to, then?

812
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:55,412
I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

813
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:58,209
He's been crazy all summer.

814
01:03:59,453 --> 01:04:01,205
He's tried to kill me since June.

815
01:04:02,653 --> 01:04:05,884
He put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

816
01:04:06,053 --> 01:04:08,931
-He beat up my friends.
-Did you contact the police?

817
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:11,645
What good would that do?

818
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:15,648
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. it wouIdn't stop him.

819
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:20,091
-Somebody's got to stop him.
-You don't understand. He's crazy.

820
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:25,486
He's got a wife, children.

821
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:28,246
He's a wonderful father.

822
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:30,403
His mother. . .

823
01:04:30,693 --> 01:04:34,766
. . .you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

824
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:38,045
It just rolls off his back.

825
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:41,205
He sees them.
He pays the rent. UnbeIievabIe!

826
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:46,972
I was the one that wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it. . .

827
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:49,803
. . .but he did it.
I don't know why.

828
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,211
Why did you want to get married?

829
01:04:56,053 --> 01:04:58,169
I thought it wouId help me.

830
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:01,801
But it didn't.

831
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:05,444
I was so confused.
I was doing. . .

832
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,046
. . .insane things.

833
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,606
What sort of things, Leon?

834
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:15,731
After the wedding. . .

835
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,291
. . .I ran off for 1 0 days
to AtIantic City.

836
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:22,044
Sonny was frantic.

837
01:05:22,453 --> 01:05:26,446
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where i was, who i was with.

838
01:05:27,573 --> 01:05:30,565
I couIdn't expIain the things I did.

839
01:05:30,813 --> 01:05:33,008
So i went to a psychiatrist. . .

840
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:34,812
. . .who told me. . .

841
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:39,247
. . .that i was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

842
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:50,247
So right away he wanted to give me
money for the sex change operation.

843
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:52,370
But where was he going to get it?

844
01:05:52,613 --> 01:05:54,126
$2,500?

845
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,812
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears aIready.

846
01:05:58,053 --> 01:05:59,805
He needed the money
for your operation?

847
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:01,964
It drove him crazy.

848
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:05,488
He wouId fly into these rages.

849
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,449
And I got more depressed than ever.

850
01:06:08,733 --> 01:06:10,724
I knew I'd never get my operation.

851
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:17,567
So I tried to kill myseIf.
I took about a half a pound of piIIs.

852
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:20,770
BIues, yeIIows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

853
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:24,365
And i wound up in the hospitaI.

854
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:28,524
And Sonny comes there. . .

855
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:30,764
. . .and he just looks at me.

856
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:33,605
And he says. . .

857
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:35,730
. . . ""Why, Leon?

858
01:06:36,053 --> 01:06:38,567
When things were going so good?""

859
01:06:43,013 --> 01:06:44,412
Don't you think. . .

860
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,486
. . .he did it for you?

861
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,884
Yeah, i guess so.

862
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:58,291
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

863
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:01,769
I can't talk to him.

864
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,850
You're up to your neck in it.
You're an accessory.

865
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:11,929
-They can't hold me responsible.
-Wait, you couId help us a little.

866
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:13,203
I'm afraid.

867
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:16,809
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

868
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:22,089
I can't.
I don't know what to. . . .

869
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,130
Just talk with him on the phone.

870
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,765
You think about it.

871
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:40,922
He won't talk to you.

872
01:07:41,413 --> 01:07:43,290
What do you mean he won't talk to me?

873
01:07:44,053 --> 01:07:45,122
I'll work on it.

874
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:47,011
I thought you were doing that.

875
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,561
He won't talk to me.

876
01:08:11,173 --> 01:08:15,052
They are questioning Leon Schermer,
a 26-year-old admitted homosexual...

877
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:18,808
... who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last November.

878
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:23,289
According to sources in the barber shop
where Leon is held...

879
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,012
...Leon has reportedly said...

880
01:08:25,253 --> 01:08:28,484
... they were married in an
official ceremony by a Father Burke.

881
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,651
Leon 's story has been confirmed.

882
01:08:33,053 --> 01:08:37,046
7 bridesmaids, all male,
Sonny's mother and 7 0 other guests...

883
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,602
...all members of the gay community.

884
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:45,609
We've been able to obtain
a still photograph of Leon in his gown.

885
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:48,452
Leon has confirmed...

886
01:08:48,693 --> 01:08:52,049
... that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost $ 7 00.

887
01:08:54,813 --> 01:08:56,769
We have not confirmed the story...

888
01:08:57,013 --> 01:09:01,052
... with the priest. But we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked.

889
01:09:02,253 --> 01:09:06,451
Phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community.

890
01:09:06,693 --> 01:09:10,163
Some in support of Sonny
and his actions, others condemning...

891
01:09:10,853 --> 01:09:13,287
... the present events
and calling the marriage...

892
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:17,811
...a farce, and, quote, ''A case
of sheer exhibitionism. '' End quote.

893
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:22,930
Coverage of the robbery where
2 homosexuals hold hostages...

894
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:25,931
...for their demands of
a helicopter, a jet....

895
01:09:26,893 --> 01:09:30,090
They said, ""2 homosexuaIs in the bank. ""
Right on TV! You hear?

896
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:33,325
What difference does it make?
They can say anything they want.

897
01:09:33,573 --> 01:09:34,892
Let them say it.

898
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,287
I'm not homosexuaI.

899
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:47,005
TeII them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

900
01:09:52,053 --> 01:09:56,444
What am I supposed to do? i can't
controI what they say on teIevision.

901
01:09:58,013 --> 01:10:01,289
What should i do? I'm doing
everything i can, i can't do that.

902
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:11,606
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

903
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:13,571
Whatever they say don't matter.

904
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:20,852
It'll be all right.

905
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:31,132
What's the matter with you?

906
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:35,692
You shouIdn't let something like that
spoil your fun.

907
01:10:36,053 --> 01:10:37,930
You have to get fun out of life.

908
01:10:44,813 --> 01:10:46,610
Where's the goddamn jet?

909
01:10:47,613 --> 01:10:50,286
They're aIways screaming overhead,
going somewhere. . .

910
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,569
. . .when you don't need them, you know?

911
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:19,404
What are you going to tell
the pilot when you get on the plane?

912
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:22,365
You have to know, right?

913
01:11:23,133 --> 01:11:24,612
Holland's pretty good.

914
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:28,243
-HoIIand?
-They sheltered peopIe during the war.

915
01:11:28,853 --> 01:11:30,491
They're good people.

916
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:32,132
Where's Holland?

917
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:33,965
It's right up. . . .

918
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:35,407
It's over there!

919
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:46,285
Get in the vauit. Come on!

920
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:47,522
QuickIy!

921
01:11:59,373 --> 01:12:01,887
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

922
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:09,686
Come on out for a second.

923
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:10,843
It's him.

924
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:13,528
Come on out.
I want to talk to you a second.

925
01:12:16,173 --> 01:12:17,526
Come on!

926
01:12:27,853 --> 01:12:29,366
Come on out, Sonny.

927
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:37,891
Come on out a minute.

928
01:12:39,253 --> 01:12:40,322
That's it.

929
01:12:56,333 --> 01:13:00,326
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

930
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:04,803
Who are you?

931
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:08,045
FBI, SheIdon.

932
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:11,966
Good.

933
01:13:12,213 --> 01:13:14,681
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started?

934
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,285
Look, get the lights back on. . .

935
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:20,411
. . .and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

936
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:22,848
No more favors.
That's all over.

937
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:24,082
Favors?

938
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,608
You been doing me favors all night?

939
01:13:27,293 --> 01:13:29,807
I have a jet, Iimo will be here
in a haIf hour.

940
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:33,682
I want the hostages.

941
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:37,212
No, no. Bullshit!

942
01:13:37,973 --> 01:13:40,362
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

943
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:42,763
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

944
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:46,047
When do i get them?

945
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:49,246
Didn't they tell you?

946
01:13:51,253 --> 01:13:52,925
I'd like to hear it from you.

947
01:13:54,773 --> 01:13:58,925
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

948
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:02,406
One hostage for the jet.

949
01:14:02,973 --> 01:14:06,124
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the pIane, check it out.

950
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:08,807
And if it's okay,
they aII come out.

951
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:13,083
-I want to go inside.
-Why?

952
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,005
See if everybody's all right.

953
01:14:15,253 --> 01:14:16,527
They're all right.

954
01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:18,332
No, I have to see.

955
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:28,492
You got guts.

956
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:31,850
Think if we sIit their throats,
we're going to Iet you out?

957
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:33,765
I have to see.

958
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,809
I got to check with my partner.

959
01:14:53,933 --> 01:14:56,322
The FBI, SaI.
They're coming in.

960
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:12,211
You'd like to kill me?

961
01:15:12,453 --> 01:15:13,602
Bet you wouId.

962
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:15,127
I wouIdn't like to kill you.

963
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:16,931
I wiII if I have to.

964
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:18,845
It's your job, right?

965
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:21,692
The guy who kills me. . .

966
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:25,926
. . .I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

967
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:35,285
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBI.

968
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:49,963
Just want to make sure all you
young Iadies are all right in here.

969
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:54,410
They asked for the jet hours ago.
What are you doing?

970
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:57,690
That's being set up. We'll
have you out in a few hours.

971
01:15:57,893 --> 01:16:00,965
-A few hours?
-Why don't you give them what they want?

972
01:16:01,173 --> 01:16:03,971
They'll get it. We want
to be sure we get what we want.

973
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:06,932
Let's get you all out of here safe.

974
01:16:08,573 --> 01:16:09,801
You two boys too.

975
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:11,407
That's close enough.

976
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:18,170
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's 2 homosexuaIs in here.

977
01:16:19,293 --> 01:16:20,362
I wiII.

978
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:24,725
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

979
01:16:49,053 --> 01:16:50,566
You handled yourself well.

980
01:16:51,013 --> 01:16:54,892
A lot of men would have choked. We
might have had a death on our hands.

981
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:57,488
But you handled it.
I respect that.

982
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,091
Don't you try to take Sai.
We'll handle him.

983
01:17:02,053 --> 01:17:03,884
Sit tight and you won't get hurt.

984
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:05,771
What are you taIking about?

985
01:17:07,493 --> 01:17:09,051
You just sit quiet.

986
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:11,682
We'll handIe SaI.

987
01:17:15,493 --> 01:17:18,007
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

988
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,607
What'd he say?

989
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,089
He was just taIking about arrangements.

990
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:43,052
I talked to him about the TV.
It will be all right.

991
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:44,882
That's all?

992
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:49,732
Why couldn't he say it here?

993
01:17:51,653 --> 01:17:56,044
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is going to come in.

994
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:07,522
What's the matter?

995
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:10,687
Someone get a glass of water.

996
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:13,848
Got a hankie?

997
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,802
They poisoned the pizza.

998
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:18,486
It's not the pizza!

999
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:20,371
He's got diabetes.

1000
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:24,968
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hoId it.

1001
01:18:25,893 --> 01:18:28,612
What can we do for you,
Mr. MuIvaney? Tell us.

1002
01:18:33,253 --> 01:18:35,289
Is there a doctor out here?

1003
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:40,284
We need a doctor in here.

1004
01:18:43,013 --> 01:18:44,492
We need a doctor.

1005
01:18:46,573 --> 01:18:47,244
What?

1006
01:18:47,493 --> 01:18:50,371
The manager, he's diabetic.
He don't look good.

1007
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:04,972
I got to search you.

1008
01:19:22,813 --> 01:19:23,928
Just him.

1009
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,688
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1010
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,166
He's coming on.

1011
01:19:58,373 --> 01:19:59,726
Hello, Leon?

1012
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:02,572
Hello, Sonny.

1013
01:20:03,013 --> 01:20:04,366
What happened?

1014
01:20:04,613 --> 01:20:06,683
How are you doing?

1015
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:09,647
WeII, I'm out of the hospital.

1016
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:13,449
Yeah, I know.
I thought you'd never get out.

1017
01:20:14,493 --> 01:20:17,485
I never thought i'd get out this way,
i'll tell you.

1018
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:21,171
How are you doing?

1019
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:24,884
I'm a little shaky.

1020
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,684
Moretti toId me that you were all
drugged up. . .

1021
01:20:29,653 --> 01:20:34,044
. . .so I figured that's why you didn't
want to talk. I was wondering why.

1022
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:35,965
It was reaIIy terrible, you know?

1023
01:20:36,213 --> 01:20:39,330
You waIk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1024
01:20:39,573 --> 01:20:41,962
Then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1025
01:20:42,973 --> 01:20:46,761
How do they expect you to get uncrazy
if you're asIeep all the time?

1026
01:20:48,213 --> 01:20:50,647
I'm just starting to come out of it now.

1027
01:20:53,013 --> 01:20:55,527
So, how are you?

1028
01:20:55,813 --> 01:20:57,087
I'm fine.

1029
01:20:59,173 --> 01:21:00,811
This is something, huh?

1030
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:10,290
I don't know.
I'm dying here.

1031
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:17,165
You ever listen to yourself
when you say, ""You're dying""?

1032
01:21:17,413 --> 01:21:20,405
-You ever listen to yourself?
-What are you taIking about?

1033
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:24,009
What do you mean, what am i
taIking about? ""You're dying. ""

1034
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,647
Do you know that
you say that to me every day?

1035
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,966
You're not dying.
You're kiIIing the people around you.

1036
01:21:31,213 --> 01:21:34,523
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need that deep shit now!

1037
01:21:34,773 --> 01:21:37,128
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1038
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:38,203
Yeah?

1039
01:21:38,453 --> 01:21:39,772
I know what I do.

1040
01:21:40,213 --> 01:21:41,851
You stick a gun
to somebody's head.

1041
01:21:42,093 --> 01:21:44,653
I don't know
what i'm doing sometimes.

1042
01:21:44,893 --> 01:21:45,643
Obviously, you don 't.

1043
01:21:45,893 --> 01:21:48,123
""Go to sIeep
so it won't hurt when i shoot. ""

1044
01:21:48,973 --> 01:21:51,487
What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?

1045
01:21:51,693 --> 01:21:54,253
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1046
01:21:56,173 --> 01:21:58,562
Now I'm talking to you
on the phone again.

1047
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,407
I've got no job.
I don't have friends.

1048
01:22:01,653 --> 01:22:04,213
I can't Iive.
I have to Iive with people.

1049
01:22:06,013 --> 01:22:07,810
This death business, I'm sorry.

1050
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:11,045
I don't know what i'm getting here
with that shit.

1051
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,206
What am i supposed to say to that?
This is going on.

1052
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:17,808
-You're giving me that shit.
-I'm sorry.

1053
01:22:18,013 --> 01:22:19,651
You know what's happening.

1054
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,407
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1055
01:22:22,653 --> 01:22:25,804
I got these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital. . .

1056
01:22:26,053 --> 01:22:29,090
. . .with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1057
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:31,722
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1058
01:22:31,973 --> 01:22:36,524
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1059
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:38,252
I didn't ask you to rob a bank!

1060
01:22:38,493 --> 01:22:40,290
I know you didn't ask me.

1061
01:22:41,653 --> 01:22:44,531
I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1062
01:22:44,773 --> 01:22:47,606
Nothing on nobody!
I did this on my own. You see?

1063
01:22:47,853 --> 01:22:50,765
Al on my own, I did it.
But i want you to know something.

1064
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:54,130
I want you to know
that i'm getting out of here.

1065
01:22:54,373 --> 01:22:56,523
I'm getting a pIane out of here. . .

1066
01:22:56,773 --> 01:23:00,322
. . .and i just wanted you to know it.
And i wanted you to come down. . .

1067
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:03,406
. . .and i wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1068
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:06,804
Or, if you wanted to,
you couId come with me.

1069
01:23:07,053 --> 01:23:09,613
You're free to do what you want.
That's what. . .

1070
01:23:09,853 --> 01:23:11,605
...I wanted to say to you.

1071
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:16,003
-I'm free to do what I want?
-Right.

1072
01:23:16,253 --> 01:23:20,849
I try to get away from you for months
and i'm going with you on a trip?

1073
01:23:21,093 --> 01:23:23,049
Where are you going?

1074
01:23:23,413 --> 01:23:27,167
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1075
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:29,369
So I'll go to AIgeria.
I don't know yet.

1076
01:23:29,613 --> 01:23:32,047
Why are you going to Algeria?

1077
01:23:33,613 --> 01:23:36,491
I don't know why.
They got a Howard Johnson's there.

1078
01:23:36,733 --> 01:23:39,406
You're warped, you know that?
You're really warped.

1079
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:41,962
I'm warped.
I know I'm warped.

1080
01:23:42,253 --> 01:23:43,686
Algeria!

1081
01:23:47,173 --> 01:23:50,370
You know they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1082
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:53,650
-They're a bunch of crazy people.
-What am i supposed to do?

1083
01:23:53,893 --> 01:23:56,885
-You couId have picked a better place.
-Like where?

1084
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:59,203
Sweden? Denmark?

1085
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:03,249
Yeah, like that.

1086
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:08,125
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1087
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:12,252
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1088
01:24:12,573 --> 01:24:16,088
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got probIems?

1089
01:24:19,373 --> 01:24:21,045
So, SaI is with you?

1090
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:22,328
Oh, boy!

1091
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:24,609
You'd be better off giving up.

1092
01:24:25,613 --> 01:24:28,810
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1093
01:24:29,053 --> 01:24:32,682
I've gone so far with this,
and why shouId I give up now?

1094
01:24:33,173 --> 01:24:34,686
I can't give up.

1095
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:41,008
-Would you do me a favor?
-Yeah, what?

1096
01:24:43,253 --> 01:24:45,847
These guys that have me down here. . .

1097
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:50,891
. . .they think i'm part of the pIot
to rob the bank.

1098
01:24:51,373 --> 01:24:54,843
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.
They're bullshitting you.

1099
01:24:55,093 --> 01:24:56,811
They're giving you a snow job.

1100
01:24:57,053 --> 01:24:59,567
They toId me i was an accessory.

1101
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:02,452
That's just a con job on you.
Don 't listen to that.

1102
01:25:02,693 --> 01:25:06,242
I have to Iisten to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1103
01:25:07,013 --> 01:25:09,322
-You're not going to prison.
-How do you know?

1104
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:11,165
Because i know.
BeIieve me.

1105
01:25:11,413 --> 01:25:13,768
Look, please, just tell them.

1106
01:25:14,013 --> 01:25:15,412
Tell them what?

1107
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:17,405
That you didn't do it?

1108
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:19,609
Are they on the phone now?

1109
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:21,802
Yeah.

1110
01:25:22,093 --> 01:25:24,607
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1111
01:25:24,893 --> 01:25:27,327
You talk with them on the phone.
Really smart!

1112
01:25:27,573 --> 01:25:29,370
-I have no choice!
-What do you mean?

1113
01:25:29,613 --> 01:25:33,367
What am I supposed to do? There are
7,000 fucking cops all around me.

1114
01:25:33,613 --> 01:25:35,490
-Who's on now?
-Don 't lay it on me!

1115
01:25:35,733 --> 01:25:38,645
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1116
01:25:38,893 --> 01:25:40,770
You knew what was happening, right?

1117
01:25:41,013 --> 01:25:42,207
Yeah!

1118
01:25:42,453 --> 01:25:44,648
I want to know
who's on the phone now.

1119
01:25:47,693 --> 01:25:48,887
Moretti, is that you?

1120
01:25:53,493 --> 01:25:56,644
WiII somebody talk to me?
Somebody going to talk to me or what?

1121
01:25:56,893 --> 01:25:57,848
They on now?

1122
01:25:58,733 --> 01:25:59,961
They won't talk to you.

1123
01:26:00,893 --> 01:26:04,363
He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1124
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:08,172
Will you get off the phone?

1125
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,163
Are they off?

1126
01:26:14,493 --> 01:26:19,044
That really convinced them. They
wanted to know. Did i do it for you?

1127
01:26:19,293 --> 01:26:21,284
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you very much.

1128
01:26:23,213 --> 01:26:25,249
So now what?
What are you going to do?

1129
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:27,571
I thought. . .

1130
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:30,929
. . .that i would
go back to the hospital.

1131
01:26:31,173 --> 01:26:35,166
They're really nice there. They
seem like they're trying to help me.

1132
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:37,609
That's good, then.
You found something.

1133
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:40,289
I don't know if i have or not.

1134
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:44,169
Are you still
going to have the operation?

1135
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:45,641
Yeah!

1136
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,610
So then, what am i
supposed to say to you?

1137
01:26:56,733 --> 01:26:57,961
Thanks a lot. . .

1138
01:26:59,933 --> 01:27:01,127
. . .and bon voyage.

1139
01:27:02,373 --> 01:27:04,364
Yeah, right.
See you sometime.

1140
01:27:05,573 --> 01:27:07,211
I'll see you in my dreams.

1141
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:09,489
Right, i'll write a song.

1142
01:27:12,773 --> 01:27:16,846
-I don't know. Life's so funny.
-You said a mouthful, sweetheart.

1143
01:27:22,813 --> 01:27:23,723
Goodbye, huh?

1144
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:56,203
Give me. . . .
Can i have--

1145
01:27:57,813 --> 01:28:00,532
You cut off the incoming caIIs.
Can I have a line?

1146
01:28:00,773 --> 01:28:03,128
I want to taIk to my wife
and to my kids.

1147
01:28:03,373 --> 01:28:05,603
He wants an outside line,
is it all right?

1148
01:28:07,133 --> 01:28:08,691
I want a line.

1149
01:28:09,053 --> 01:28:10,281
I'm getting it.

1150
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:14,450
I couId caII anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1151
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:16,766
The Pope, an astronaut. . .

1152
01:28:18,013 --> 01:28:19,731
. . .the wisest of the wise.

1153
01:28:20,853 --> 01:28:22,809
Who do i have to caII?

1154
01:28:24,853 --> 01:28:27,048
I just don't know what to do.

1155
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:35,802
Angie.

1156
01:28:36,053 --> 01:28:38,521
Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1157
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:42,129
-Where are the kids?
-I sent them to the neighbors.

1158
01:28:42,773 --> 01:28:46,402
I can't beIieve!
I mean, it ain't like you.

1159
01:28:46,653 --> 01:28:47,529
I know.

1160
01:28:47,773 --> 01:28:50,446
You've never done anything
like it before in your life.

1161
01:28:50,693 --> 01:28:53,207
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1162
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:57,924
I blame myself. I notice you been
tense, like something is happening.

1163
01:28:58,173 --> 01:29:01,131
Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.

1164
01:29:01,373 --> 01:29:02,806
Then you want me to go...

1165
01:29:03,053 --> 01:29:05,647
. . .on that ride, here
to there, fuII of those kids.

1166
01:29:05,893 --> 01:29:09,124
It's ridicuIous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me. . .

1167
01:29:09,373 --> 01:29:13,491
. . . ""You pig, get on the fucking ride! ""
Everything fell out of me.

1168
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:16,964
My heart, my liver,
just fell to the floor. Everything!

1169
01:29:17,213 --> 01:29:21,650
You know what it felt like? You yeIIing
at me in front of all those people?

1170
01:29:21,893 --> 01:29:24,088
You never talked to me
like that before.

1171
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:27,723
I think, ""He's going to shoot me
and dump my body in the river. ""

1172
01:29:27,973 --> 01:29:29,691
I was scared of you!

1173
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:34,251
WiII you shut the fuck up
and listen to me? Just Iisten to me!

1174
01:29:34,493 --> 01:29:36,688
You see that?
With the Ianguage?

1175
01:29:36,933 --> 01:29:39,208
I'm trying to talk to you, and you--

1176
01:29:39,453 --> 01:29:41,125
A person can't communicate with you!

1177
01:29:41,373 --> 01:29:44,888
What am I here? I'm your wife.
I'm your wife!

1178
01:29:45,973 --> 01:29:48,123
You know something?
You hurt me.

1179
01:29:48,373 --> 01:29:52,002
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1180
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:54,884
Did i ever do anything
to make you do that?

1181
01:29:55,133 --> 01:29:57,852
Did i ever turn you down or anything?

1182
01:29:58,093 --> 01:29:59,811
I know i let myseIf get fat.

1183
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:03,125
-Don't call yourseIf fat.
-You can 't stand me to say it.

1184
01:30:03,373 --> 01:30:07,252
Like i can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1185
01:30:07,413 --> 01:30:09,688
Yeah? You know what love is?

1186
01:30:09,933 --> 01:30:13,243
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1187
01:30:15,253 --> 01:30:17,289
Talk to me about Iove,
go ahead.

1188
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:19,652
Sonny, I'm scared.

1189
01:30:19,893 --> 01:30:22,612
I'm scared. Are they
going to shoot me or something?

1190
01:30:22,853 --> 01:30:24,206
No, they're not!

1191
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:28,207
You should see it on the Tv.
They got cannons, machine guns.

1192
01:30:28,453 --> 01:30:30,409
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1193
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:32,530
It's late aIready
by the time i find out. . .

1194
01:30:32,773 --> 01:30:36,368
...it's just you and Sal. I can 't get
a babysitter! What'll I do?

1195
01:31:07,813 --> 01:31:10,964
I think i better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1196
01:31:21,573 --> 01:31:24,326
What's the matter?
He going to die or what?

1197
01:31:24,573 --> 01:31:28,691
It's just a precautionary measure.
It's awfully warm in here.

1198
01:31:40,973 --> 01:31:43,771
AII right, then. Let's go,
Iet him out.

1199
01:31:44,013 --> 01:31:45,969
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1200
01:31:46,813 --> 01:31:48,531
I just needed the injection.

1201
01:31:48,773 --> 01:31:52,846
You trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1202
01:31:53,093 --> 01:31:55,084
I'm not trying to be anything.

1203
01:31:55,653 --> 01:31:57,530
I just want to be left aIone.

1204
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:02,731
-No one is bothering you.
-I wish to fuck you never came!

1205
01:32:04,173 --> 01:32:05,288
That's all.

1206
01:32:06,133 --> 01:32:08,772
Don't try to act like
you're an angeI of human kindness.

1207
01:32:12,893 --> 01:32:14,724
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1208
01:32:21,853 --> 01:32:24,413
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1209
01:32:42,253 --> 01:32:45,848
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1210
01:33:14,493 --> 01:33:15,642
Ladies!

1211
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:22,726
I want to apoIogize
for my use of Ianguage back there.

1212
01:33:23,413 --> 01:33:25,563
Why? What did you say?

1213
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:32,844
What?

1214
01:33:33,093 --> 01:33:34,572
He said the 'F' word.

1215
01:33:34,813 --> 01:33:36,326
What did he say?

1216
01:33:36,573 --> 01:33:38,052
He said the 'F' word.

1217
01:33:45,013 --> 01:33:47,732
-Fuck.
-I know, Miriam!

1218
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:53,968
I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1219
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,965
-Then we shouIdn't go after them.
-Then we won't.

1220
01:34:04,613 --> 01:34:05,728
What's that?

1221
01:34:06,893 --> 01:34:08,804
CouId you come out, pIease?

1222
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:12,962
My mother.

1223
01:34:15,373 --> 01:34:17,443
Someone here to see you.

1224
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,524
CouId you come out, please?

1225
01:34:23,373 --> 01:34:25,204
Sonny, could you come out, pIease?

1226
01:34:32,013 --> 01:34:34,243
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1227
01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:37,329
I don't need you down here.

1228
01:34:38,493 --> 01:34:41,644
AII of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of teIevision.

1229
01:34:41,893 --> 01:34:45,090
-I got it all worked out, Ma.
-I talked to the man from the FBI.

1230
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,165
Who?
No, don't talk to anybody.

1231
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:50,609
He says if you come out now,
everything is going to be all right.

1232
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:53,765
-I'm trying to get you out of this.
-Don't talk to the FBI.

1233
01:34:54,013 --> 01:34:55,207
I told them everything. . .

1234
01:34:55,453 --> 01:34:59,651
. . .how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you aIways had good jobs.

1235
01:34:59,893 --> 01:35:03,363
I told them you were with GoIdwater
in '64 in the convention and--

1236
01:35:03,613 --> 01:35:06,411
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and i'm going to Algeria.

1237
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:08,405
I'll write you from there.

1238
01:35:08,893 --> 01:35:10,929
-I've got to go!
-I don't understand you.

1239
01:35:11,173 --> 01:35:14,085
If i stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1240
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:18,372
-They'll think i'll come out with you.
-What's the matter with that?

1241
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:20,365
Because i'm not coming with you.

1242
01:35:20,613 --> 01:35:25,004
The FBI understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1243
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:28,086
It's the pressures from your home Iife!

1244
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:31,723
-Don't get on Angie now.
-Did i say one word against her?

1245
01:35:31,973 --> 01:35:34,806
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1246
01:35:35,053 --> 01:35:37,362
Your life was sweetness and roses.

1247
01:35:38,173 --> 01:35:42,530
You wouIdn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1248
01:35:42,773 --> 01:35:46,209
I don't understand why you
want to sleep with her anyway.

1249
01:35:46,453 --> 01:35:48,648
You got 2 kids on welfare now.

1250
01:35:48,893 --> 01:35:53,409
-You want 3 kids on welfare?
-I can't talk to you about this now.

1251
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:56,083
What are you going to do?
Come out.

1252
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:57,322
I can't come out.
I can't.

1253
01:35:57,573 --> 01:35:59,245
Sal is in there with the peopIe.

1254
01:35:59,493 --> 01:36:02,053
If i come out, he's going to kill them.

1255
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:03,885
Run!

1256
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:07,205
Run? Where am I going to run?
Ma, i can't run!

1257
01:36:07,453 --> 01:36:09,842
-Maybe--
-There's no maybe. No maybes.

1258
01:36:10,093 --> 01:36:12,891
You got to go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1259
01:36:13,133 --> 01:36:16,489
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1260
01:36:17,173 --> 01:36:19,164
-He says you're dead.
-He's right.

1261
01:36:21,133 --> 01:36:23,408
I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1262
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:26,884
You come near me, you're
going to get fucked over and fucked out!

1263
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:29,931
Now, I got to go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1264
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:31,572
Just take her home.

1265
01:36:31,813 --> 01:36:34,407
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby!

1266
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:37,851
Get her home now!

1267
01:36:47,133 --> 01:36:48,885
Ten minutes.

1312
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:19,642
Watch out!

1313
01:41:26,893 --> 01:41:28,724
Come on, Sarge, just one picture?

1314
01:41:36,373 --> 01:41:38,045
Back, back!

1315
01:42:06,373 --> 01:42:07,772
You the driver?

1316
01:42:10,973 --> 01:42:12,725
I want to check it out.

1317
01:42:16,653 --> 01:42:17,688
Seats come out?

1318
01:42:18,053 --> 01:42:19,168
They're bolted.

1319
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:29,367
AII right, here.
Light me on that side.

1320
01:42:30,813 --> 01:42:31,802
Over there.

1321
01:42:44,493 --> 01:42:46,768
You're the man, huh?

1322
01:42:48,053 --> 01:42:50,328
I was watching.
I saw you, man!

1323
01:42:51,773 --> 01:42:54,651
You shouId see yourseIf,

1324
01:42:54,933 --> 01:42:56,252
I beIieve it.

1325
01:42:56,493 --> 01:42:57,608
Sheila won't!

1326
01:42:58,253 --> 01:42:59,766
-Who?
-My old lady!

1327
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:03,085
They said, ""Gas up a stretch,
go to 285 Prospect Park West. ""

1328
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,289
Give me some light over here.

1329
01:43:05,693 --> 01:43:08,253
I said, ""Shit, another load
from the massage parlors! ""

1330
01:43:25,173 --> 01:43:26,128
It's okay.

1331
01:43:26,613 --> 01:43:28,490
I'm going to remember you.

1332
01:43:35,533 --> 01:43:37,967
This is Agent Murphy.
He'II be your driver.

1333
01:43:38,293 --> 01:43:39,521
No, I want him.

1334
01:43:42,413 --> 01:43:44,688
-Give me the bIack guy.
-I'm not into that shit.

1335
01:43:44,933 --> 01:43:46,082
Nobody will hurt you.

1336
01:43:47,093 --> 01:43:49,926
If they were going to shoot,
they wouId've shot aIready.

1337
01:43:50,133 --> 01:43:51,930
-I can't allow that, Sonny.
-You can't allow?

1338
01:43:52,933 --> 01:43:56,164
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1339
01:43:57,453 --> 01:43:59,967
I'II pay you. What do you want?
$ 1 00? $200?

1340
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:01,771
$ 1 ,000? Come on.

1341
01:44:02,933 --> 01:44:04,810
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1342
01:44:09,453 --> 01:44:10,886
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1343
01:44:16,053 --> 01:44:19,045
You men that shoot,
aim for white meat.

1344
01:44:26,973 --> 01:44:28,008
Take a walk.

1345
01:44:30,093 --> 01:44:31,048
Give me him.

1346
01:44:33,293 --> 01:44:34,726
Think i'm an idiot?

1347
01:44:37,093 --> 01:44:38,412
Take a waIk, cop!

1348
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:45,449
Everybody is a con man.

1349
01:44:50,453 --> 01:44:52,171
I want everyone across the street.

1350
01:44:53,773 --> 01:44:56,048
I want them all back,
on the sidewalk!

1351
01:44:56,293 --> 01:44:57,646
Let's go!

1352
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,528
At Ieast i know
who i'm deaIing with now.

1353
01:45:03,653 --> 01:45:05,609
Here's a pen for you.
Come on!

1354
01:45:15,773 --> 01:45:17,570
Don't move, okay?

1355
01:45:22,133 --> 01:45:23,885
Here's your document.

1356
01:45:24,973 --> 01:45:27,168
-Thanks.
-You've got to sign it!

1357
01:45:30,013 --> 01:45:31,366
We're taking off.

1358
01:45:31,613 --> 01:45:32,966
We're going now.

1359
01:45:33,533 --> 01:45:35,364
Sal! Where is he?

1360
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:39,211
That's it, we're going.

1361
01:45:40,013 --> 01:45:42,004
Here, peopIe, let's go!
We're going.

1362
01:45:42,653 --> 01:45:46,202
-Can i get my sweater?
-Get what you had when you came in.

1363
01:46:03,373 --> 01:46:04,601
How are you doing?

1364
01:46:04,853 --> 01:46:05,922
Good.

1365
01:46:06,173 --> 01:46:08,323
We're going to do it, right?

1366
01:46:08,813 --> 01:46:10,610
We're going to do it.

1367
01:46:10,853 --> 01:46:13,321
You got to keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1368
01:46:13,573 --> 01:46:15,768
-I need it.
-No, it's mine.

1369
01:46:16,013 --> 01:46:18,129
You got to keep
your eye on him, see?

1370
01:46:22,933 --> 01:46:24,730
All right,
where am I now?

1371
01:47:20,293 --> 01:47:21,772
All right, hold it!

1372
01:47:23,013 --> 01:47:24,526
All right, let's go.

1373
01:47:25,413 --> 01:47:27,369
Swing around now.

1374
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:30,365
Just keep holding hands.

1375
01:47:36,173 --> 01:47:37,128
Hold it!

1376
01:47:39,733 --> 01:47:41,928
Break it on ""3. ""
Not yet, don't break it.

1377
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:47,362
Go!

1378
01:47:58,133 --> 01:48:00,044
Fuck, we did it!

1379
01:48:00,413 --> 01:48:01,607
We did it!

1380
01:48:01,853 --> 01:48:03,047
Wish us luck!

1381
01:48:07,813 --> 01:48:08,928
You got your one.

1382
01:48:09,533 --> 01:48:10,568
Follow my car.

1383
01:48:23,093 --> 01:48:24,526
Get me Kennedy.

1384
01:48:25,853 --> 01:48:27,172
We did it!

1385
01:48:29,133 --> 01:48:31,363
I'II be a son of a bitch!
We did it!

1386
01:48:31,973 --> 01:48:34,851
Okay, Iet's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1387
01:48:37,333 --> 01:48:39,528
Do me a favor, will you?

1388
01:48:39,773 --> 01:48:42,606
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, it'll go off.

1389
01:48:52,533 --> 01:48:53,727
You set out there?

1390
01:48:57,093 --> 01:48:58,811
We're leaving now.

1391
01:48:59,053 --> 01:49:00,850
We want no trouble en route.

1392
01:49:03,733 --> 01:49:04,961
Intersection check?

1393
01:49:07,573 --> 01:49:09,450
We'll be starting up right now.

1394
01:49:09,693 --> 01:49:10,921
1 0-4.

1395
01:49:41,573 --> 01:49:42,926
It'll be all right.

1396
01:50:09,293 --> 01:50:12,171
You just have to remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1397
01:52:33,213 --> 01:52:34,362
What's he doing?

1398
01:52:34,733 --> 01:52:37,008
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1399
01:52:49,973 --> 01:52:50,883
That's it?

1400
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,086
SaI, see it?
There it is.

1401
01:53:49,613 --> 01:53:51,171
I forgot!

1402
01:53:51,413 --> 01:53:53,449
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1403
01:53:58,133 --> 01:53:59,566
Do they have food on board?

1404
01:54:05,533 --> 01:54:06,522
Your jet.

1405
01:54:06,933 --> 01:54:08,889
We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1406
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:11,283
Right.
Okay, who goes?

1407
01:54:11,813 --> 01:54:12,848
Sylvia?

1408
01:54:15,213 --> 01:54:16,202
Maria.

1409
01:54:23,893 --> 01:54:25,804
I'll pray for you.

1410
01:54:28,533 --> 01:54:30,683
Because this is your first plane trip. . .

1411
01:54:30,933 --> 01:54:33,163
. . .don't be scared, okay?

1412
01:54:46,173 --> 01:54:49,210
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1413
01:54:49,533 --> 01:54:51,046
There'll be hamburgers.
Ready?

1414
01:54:56,653 --> 01:54:57,642
Ready to go?

1415
01:54:58,813 --> 01:54:59,882
Yeah.

1416
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:06,961
Let's move.

1417
01:55:10,933 --> 01:55:13,891
We don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1418
01:55:14,253 --> 01:55:15,891
Keep your gun pointed up.

1419
01:55:18,053 --> 01:55:19,691
Ready to get out first?

1420
01:55:20,053 --> 01:55:20,849
Ready.

1421
01:55:26,173 --> 01:55:27,128
Don't shoot me.

1422
01:56:04,533 --> 01:56:05,932
Now spread them!

1423
01:56:11,773 --> 01:56:13,365
We're all secure here.

1424
01:56:13,613 --> 01:56:16,047
Murphy will report from the car.

1425
01:56:20,573 --> 01:56:22,086
You make the report.

1426
01:56:22,333 --> 01:56:23,686
Put the gun down.

1427
01:56:23,933 --> 01:56:25,127
Back off.

1428
01:56:25,973 --> 01:56:27,611
Get up now, Sonny.

1429
01:56:28,533 --> 01:56:29,932
You're under arrest.

1430
01:56:30,173 --> 01:56:32,209
You have the right to remain siIent.

1431
01:56:32,453 --> 01:56:35,809
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1432
01:56:36,053 --> 01:56:40,092
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1433
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:42,403
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer. . .

1434
01:56:42,653 --> 01:56:46,407

to represent you if you wish one.

1435
01:56:59,533 --> 01:57:02,172
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1436
01:57:02,413 --> 01:57:05,644
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1437
01:57:05,893 --> 01:57:06,848
Repeat:

1438
01:57:07,093 --> 01:57:10,244
Agent Sheldon, would you please
