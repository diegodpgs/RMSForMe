Subtitles readjusted by Punter18

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,235
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

3
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,944
All persons who have
anything to do before my lords,

4
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:25,151
the queen's justices of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery

5
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:28,621
for the jurisdiction
of the Central Criminal Court

6
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:33,376
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

7
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:06,758
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

8
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:13,012
It's worth having the fog just to appreciate
the sunshine. Is there a draught?

9
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:18,105
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

10
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:21,771
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

11
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:24,195
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

12
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:29,996
We've been flat on our back
for two months, we'd better be careful.

13
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:45,299
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

14
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,968
How lucky you lawyers are.

15
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:52,677
I almost married a lawyer.
I was in attendance for his appendectomy

16
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,518
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up.

17
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:58,685
And then peritonitis set in
and he went like that.

18
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,903
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

19
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,660
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

20
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,920
Oh, shut up!

21
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,088
Williams, my cane.

22
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,389
Here he comes!

23
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:45,657
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

24
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:49,947
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

25
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,243
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

26
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,831
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

27
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:00,128
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

28
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:04,468
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

29
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:08,177
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

30
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:11,676
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

31
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,437
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

32
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,317
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

33
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,364
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

34
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:33,781
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

35
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:38,459
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

36
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:42,371
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

37
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:46,340
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

38
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,555
37 years! Has it been all that long?

39
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:54,677
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

40
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:59,724
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

41
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:04,854
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

42
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:09,817
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

43
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,992
Right here.

44
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,074
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

45
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,081
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

46
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:23,914
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

47
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,048
What's all this?

48
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:35,761
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

49
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:39,347
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

50
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:43,232
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

51
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:47,988
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

52
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:51,450
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

53
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:55,908
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

54
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:00,585
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

55
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:03,334
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

56
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,497
Sorry, sir.

57
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:08,299
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

58
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:12,213
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

59
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,644
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

60
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:20,520
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

61
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,188
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

62
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,740
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

63
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:34,822
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

64
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:41,125
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

65
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:46,296
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

66
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:50,554
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

67
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:54,809
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

68
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:57,604
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

69
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,517
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

70
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,065
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

71
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:07,610
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

72
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,825
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

73
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,244
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

74
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,166
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

75
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:28,510
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

76
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:31,008
No. Upstairs.

77
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,010
A few puffs after meals? Please.

78
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:40,432
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

79
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:44,479
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

80
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:51,064
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

81
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:55,068
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

82
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,285
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

83
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:04,210
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

84
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,171
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

85
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:11,386
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

86
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:15,807
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

87
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,903
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

88
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:30,939
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

89
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,633
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

90
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:50,546
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

91
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:55,424
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

92
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,717
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

93
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,426
Serious criminal matter.

94
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,899
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

95
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:09,112
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

96
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:12,442
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

97
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,149
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

98
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,952
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

99
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:22,950
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

100
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:28,543
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

101
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,760
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

102
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,592
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

103
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,926
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

104
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,223
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

105
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:45,440
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

106
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:56,656
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

107
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,950
Mayhew! Mayhew!

108
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,835
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

109
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,496
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

110
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:10,467
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

111
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:14,543
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

112
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,385
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

113
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,222
You go ahead. Start it without me.

114
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,188
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

115
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:28,064
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

116
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,650
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

117
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,984
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

118
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:38,067
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

119
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,328
Well, for murder.

120
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,999
Oh!

121
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,874
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

122
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:49,836
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

123
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,090
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

124
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,136
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

125
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,552
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

126
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,850
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

127
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:04,845
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

128
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:08,565
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

129
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:12,774
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

130
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:17,201
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

131
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:21,539
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

132
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:26,411
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

133
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:29,215
This will take all our cunning.

134
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:35,969
Young man!

135
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,971
Come here, please.

136
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:42,393
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

137
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,643
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

138
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,857
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

139
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:53,610
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

140
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,694
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

141
00:11:56,826 --> 00:12:00,242
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

142
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:04,868
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

143
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:09,331
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

144
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:13,509
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

145
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:16,506
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

146
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,467
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

147
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:27,388
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

148
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,766
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

149
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:34,030
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

150
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:37,406
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

151
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:40,108
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

152
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,488
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

153
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,743
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

154
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:49,957
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

155
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,885
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

156
00:12:56,012 --> 00:13:00,010
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

157
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:05,052
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

158
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:09,102
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

159
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:12,852
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

160
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:17,400
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

161
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:19,692
Well, it can't be helped now.

162
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:24,241
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

163
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:28,206
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

164
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:33,212
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

165
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,667
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

166
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:40,050
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

167
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:42,803
We try not to make a habit of it.

168
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:46,515
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

169
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:51,274
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

170
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:54,687
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

171
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:58,440
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

172
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:02,870
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

173
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:06,781
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

174
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,121
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

175
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:14,632
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

176
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,804
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

177
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,639
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

178
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:27,351
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

179
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,099
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

180
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:36,359
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

181
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,407
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

182
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:43,366
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

183
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:49,084
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

184
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,337
Hold this.

185
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:58,834
Carter?

186
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:02,885
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

187
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,934
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

188
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,387
Not even as a nurse during the war.

189
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:12,306
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

190
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,770
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

191
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:20,856
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

192
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,745
We should explain
that I have very little money.

193
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,196
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

194
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:28,621
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

195
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,871
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

196
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:35,041
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

197
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:40,631
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

198
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:44,097
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

199
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:48,519
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

200
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:53,558
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

201
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:58,439
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

202
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,147
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

203
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:05,828
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

204
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:08,661
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

205
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:13,419
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

206
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:16,252
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

207
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,962
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

208
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:25,176
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

209
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:30,975
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

210
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:34,273
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

211
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,690
But my best is really this eggbeater.

212
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:40,272
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

213
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,815
Is that really desirable?

214
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,490
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

215
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,872
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

216
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,045
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

217
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:58,545
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

218
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,460
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

219
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:05,432
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

220
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,517
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

221
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,604
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

222
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,277
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

223
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:06,869
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

224
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:09,867
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

225
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,415
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

226
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:17,874
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

227
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,135
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

228
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,759
You buy that hat. I insist.

229
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:31,428
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

230
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:36,024
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

231
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,479
Go on, please.

232
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,184
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

233
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:42,611
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

234
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,983
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

235
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:50,789
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

236
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:17,310
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

237
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,815
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

238
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,315
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

239
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,691
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

240
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,242
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

241
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:39,419
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

242
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,040
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

243
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,964
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

244
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:50,435
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

245
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,772
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

246
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,519
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

247
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,652
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

248
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,946
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

249
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:07,906
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

250
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:10,824
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

251
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:15,535
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

252
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,955
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

253
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,293
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

254
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:25,877
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

255
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,758
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

256
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,936
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

257
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:39,149
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

258
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,313
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

259
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:45,068
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

260
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,319
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

261
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,944
We must have one. Is it expensive?

262
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,532
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

263
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,665
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

264
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:03,423
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

265
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,891
Ha!

266
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:17,145
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

267
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,313
Why not?

268
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:22,112
This is a charming room.

269
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:26,531
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

270
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,900
Hubert was my husband.

271
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,747
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

272
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:35,364
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

273
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,992
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

274
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:41,877
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

275
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:46,175
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

276
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:48,510
Oh, here's tea.

277
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:55,678
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

278
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,814
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

279
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:01,397
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

280
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,567
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

281
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:08,025
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

282
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,154
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

283
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:18,165
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

284
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:21,829
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

285
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,874
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

286
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,799
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

287
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,678
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

288
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,849
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

289
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,188
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

290
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:45,647
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

291
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:50,324
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

292
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,492
and unsanitary.

293
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,787
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

294
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,165
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

295
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,251
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

296
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,463
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

297
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,724
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

298
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,519
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

299
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,721
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

300
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,604
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

301
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,774
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

302
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,939
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

303
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,825
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

304
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,284
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

305
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,240
- Because...
- Because what?

306
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,956
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

307
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,493
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

308
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,579
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

309
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:49,133
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

310
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,631
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

311
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,842
Well, yes, in a way.

312
00:23:55,477 --> 00:24:00,305
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

313
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,726
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

314
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,019
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

315
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,859
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

316
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,529
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

317
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,444
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

318
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,451
with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.

319
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,253
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

320
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:26,005
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

321
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:30,083
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

322
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:33,554
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

323
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:38,012
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

324
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,144
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

325
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:44,773
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

326
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,191
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

327
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:51,236
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

328
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:55,697
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

329
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,164
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

330
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:02,328
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

331
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:07,622
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

332
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,511
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

333
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:12,962
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

334
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:18,341
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

335
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:21,230
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

336
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:25,306
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

337
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,321
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

338
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,326
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

339
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:39,242
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

340
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,747
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

341
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:44,249
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

342
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,424
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

343
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,876
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

344
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:54,131
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

345
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:57,385
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

346
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:00,305
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

347
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:04,566
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

348
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:09,319
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

349
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,483
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

350
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:19,030
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

351
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:23,543
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

352
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,039
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

353
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:31,005
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's $80,000.

354
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:35,549
- What $80,000?
- The $80,000 Mrs French left you.

355
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:36,845
Left me?

356
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:42,136
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

357
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:47,311
- Congratulations.
- $80,000!

358
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:51,027
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

359
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:53,196
I must call Christine.

360
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:58,782
Oh.

361
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,915
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

362
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:05,494
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

363
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:11,169
They will indeed. $80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

364
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:13,971
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

365
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,136
It's not unlikely.

366
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:26,897
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

367
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:31,569
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

368
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:36,110
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

369
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:40,787
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

370
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:44,581
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

371
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:47,380
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

372
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:52,880
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

373
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,760
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

374
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,722
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

375
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:03,308
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

376
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:08,017
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

377
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,821
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

378
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:16,652
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

379
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:21,780
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

380
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,870
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

381
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,493
That won't be necessary, sir.

382
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,165
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

383
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,132
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

384
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:40,637
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

385
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:49,104
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

386
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:51,441
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

387
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:54,488
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

388
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:58,400
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

389
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:04,454
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

390
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:08,125
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

391
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:16,423
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

392
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,594
Good day, sir.

393
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,848
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

394
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:27,272
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

395
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,934
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

396
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,901
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

397
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:39,575
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

398
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:41,779
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

399
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:45,912
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

400
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:51,954
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

401
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,460
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

402
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,714
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

403
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:01,421
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

404
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,687
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

405
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:13,648
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

406
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:19,984
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

407
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:26,238
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

408
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,618
Take me, I'm yours.

409
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:31,378
Oh!

410
00:30:31,506 --> 00:30:36,085
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

411
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:40,965
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

412
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:45,263
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

413
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:48,930
I do not think
that will be necessary.

414
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,559
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

415
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:58,529
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

416
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:01,150
I'm Christine Vole.

417
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,908
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

418
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,079
How do you do?

419
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,245
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

420
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:12,296
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

421
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:17,418
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

422
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:21,136
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

423
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:24,717
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

424
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:27,474
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

425
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:30,689
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

426
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,897
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

427
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:39,236
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

428
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:40,742
Oh?

429
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,704
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

430
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,403
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

431
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,998
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

432
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:59,125
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

433
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:11,181
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

434
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,938
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

435
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:16,525
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

436
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:19,609
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

437
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:23,027
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

438
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:27,160
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

439
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:33,498
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

440
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:36,667
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

441
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,885
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

442
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:42,682
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

443
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:47,350
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

444
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:52,140
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

445
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:56,854
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

446
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,902
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

447
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,441
All right. Hop in!

448
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,945
Sir Wilfrid?

449
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:11,494
Sir Wilfrid!

450
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,419
Come back!

451
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:18,542
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

452
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,839
Go on.

453
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,718
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

454
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:27,052
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

455
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:31,183
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

456
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:33,473
and the socks were two sizes too large,

457
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:36,314
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

458
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,485
Leonard has a way with women.

459
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:44,403
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

460
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:49,578
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

461
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,785
Yes. A lot of money.

462
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,795
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

463
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,166
Is that what he told you?

464
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:01,793
Surely you're not suggesting different?

465
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,974
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

466
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,973
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

467
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:16,439
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

468
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,234
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

469
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:23,734
What hypocrites you are in this country.

470
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:27,909
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

471
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,666
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

472
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:36,839
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

473
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:40,381
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

474
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,639
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

475
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:47,600
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

476
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:51,558
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

477
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:54,358
I assume you want to help your husband?

478
00:34:54,483 --> 00:35:00,153
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

479
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:04,409
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

480
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:08,321
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

481
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:12,370
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

482
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,917
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

483
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,004
Isn't it the truth?

484
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:20,006
Of course.

485
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:23,052
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

486
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:26,382
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

487
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:28,804
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

488
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:32,220
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

489
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:34,976
and who must have an interpreter.

490
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:38,393
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

491
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:40,900
as long as they tell the truth.

492
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,400
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

493
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:47,618
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

494
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:51,613
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

495
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,910
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

496
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:03,584
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

497
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,469
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

498
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,933
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

499
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:15,106
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

500
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,438
How very convenient.

501
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:19,726
We are dealing with a capital crime.

502
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:23,646
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

503
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:27,411
He is not my husband.

504
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:36,242
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

505
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:40,293
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

506
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:44,374
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

507
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:48,640
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

508
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:51,388
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

509
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,808
Don't you think you should be grateful?

510
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,061
One can get very tired of gratitude.

511
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:58,895
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

512
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:02,312
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

513
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,653
And you?

514
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:07,155
You want to know too much.

515
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:09,741
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

516
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:16,252
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

517
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:21,087
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

518
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:26,211
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely. "

519
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:30,214
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

520
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,765
And you're satisfied, I hope?

521
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:40,729
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

522
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,399
That woman's up to something. But what?

523
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:47,575
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

524
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:51,201
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

525
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,114
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

526
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:57,659
With the odds all on the other side.

527
00:37:57,795 --> 00:38:00,333
I haven't got much to go on, have I?

528
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:03,038
The fact is, I've got nothing.

529
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,341
Let me ask you something.

530
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:09,970
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

531
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,975
Do you?

532
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,763
Do you?

533
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,940
I'm not sure.

534
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,652
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

535
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:27,568
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

536
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,370
I'll take it from here.

537
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:36,705
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

538
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:39,291
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

539
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:42,457
Did you hear me? A match!

540
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:20,251
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

541
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:25,754
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

542
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,506
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

543
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:30,880
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

544
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,055
This is what you were wearing that night.

545
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:37,099
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

546
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,686
Over here against the wall, please.

547
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:45,064
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

548
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:48,731
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

549
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:51,572
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

550
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,574
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

551
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:56,995
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

552
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:01,253
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

553
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:05,957
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

554
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:08,714
Mayhew, give me the reports.

555
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:12,012
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

556
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:17,266
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

557
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:24,899
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

558
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:27,152
particularly her income tax returns. "

559
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:30,199
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

560
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:33,611
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

561
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:36,747
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

562
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:39,579
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

563
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:45,915
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

564
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,799
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

565
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:53,630
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

566
00:40:53,766 --> 00:41:00,481
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

567
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:05,897
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

568
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:10,074
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

569
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,699
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

570
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,830
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

571
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:21,286
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

572
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,459
In Germany in 1945.

573
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,260
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

574
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:34,136
I Was stationed outside Hamburg,
With an RAF maintenance unit.

575
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:39,806
I'd just installed a shoWer in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a Weekend pass.

576
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,229
Come on!

577
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,902
Join the party

578
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:49,113
Have a hearty glass of rum

579
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,858
Don't ever think about tomorrow

580
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:56,078
For tomorrow may never come

581
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,534
When I find me a happy place

582
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:03,705
That's where I wanna stay

583
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:10,719
Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way

584
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:15,673
I may never go home any more

585
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,225
Dim the lights
and start locking the door

586
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:22,639
Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me

587
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:26,357
After all that's what sailors are for

588
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:31,481
I've got kisses and kisses galore

589
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,902
That have never been tasted before

590
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:38,287
If you treat me right
This could be the night

591
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,957
I may never go home

592
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,703
I may never go home

593
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,620
I may never go home

594
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:45,373
I may never go home

595
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:49,005
I may never go home any more

596
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,639
I may never go home any more

597
00:42:57,768 --> 00:43:00,935
Hey, Frulein, show us some legs.

598
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:05,191
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

599
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:08,852
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

600
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:12,817
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

601
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,284
All right, Frulein,
if you won't show 'em, I will.

602
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:47,477
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

603
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,329
Come on.

604
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:07,082
Bring him round to the other truck.

605
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:14,213
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

606
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,674
Gesundheit.

607
00:45:00,518 --> 00:45:03,270
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

608
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:05,472
Oh, let me help you.

609
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,733
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

610
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:16,857
I'm terribly sorry.

611
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,282
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

612
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:23,457
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

613
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:27,961
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

614
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:31,623
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

615
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:33,798
Cigarette? Gum?

616
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,059
You're burning my nose.

617
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

618
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,355
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

619
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,028
How much?

620
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:54,313
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

621
00:45:54,448 --> 00:45:58,398
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

622
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,576
Got any hot water at your place?

623
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:04,121
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

624
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,875
Nearby.

625
00:46:06,753 --> 00:46:08,580
Come.

626
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:17,092
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

627
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:20,840
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemtlich sort of way.

628
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:24,558
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

629
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:28,057
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

630
00:46:28,191 --> 00:46:30,943
She has a Ford automobile.

631
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:34,154
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

632
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:37,531
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

633
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:41,277
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

634
00:46:41,413 --> 00:46:43,785
You'd better sit down on the cot.

635
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,624
The cot?

636
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:49,286
Getting more gemtlich all the time.
Are you married?

637
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:51,330
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

638
00:46:51,465 --> 00:46:54,086
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

639
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:58,132
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

640
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:03,009
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

641
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:05,385
But it's getting better.

642
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:12,275
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

643
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:18,607
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

644
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:37,834
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

645
00:47:37,971 --> 00:47:40,010
Very fair.

646
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:45,226
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

647
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,393
I would.

648
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:00,356
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

649
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,237
Milk?

650
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:04,198
Sure.

651
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,200
Milk. Sugar.

652
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:11,786
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

653
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,749
Yeah.

654
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:22,844
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

655
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:27,518
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

656
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:31,775
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

657
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:35,400
I may never go home any more

658
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:44,537
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

659
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:48,578
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

660
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,038
Ooh.

661
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:53,254
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

662
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:55,670
Maybe I can fix it.

663
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,840
I'm good at it.

664
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:06,893
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

665
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,852
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

666
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:14,268
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

667
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:18,270
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

668
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:21,906
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

669
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:26,744
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

670
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:32,461
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

671
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:37,499
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

672
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:40,461
You're not? Why not?

673
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:44,345
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

674
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:46,883
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

675
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:50,139
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

676
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:54,484
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

677
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,110
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

678
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,901
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

679
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:07,863
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

680
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,668
Let us wish each other luck.

681
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:21,796
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

682
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:26,639
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

683
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:31,726
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

684
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:52,455
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

685
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:56,714
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

686
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,758
murdered Emily Jane French.

687
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:02,590
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

688
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:05,806
Are you guilty or not guilty?

689
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,436
Not guilty.

690
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:13,520
Members of the jury,

691
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:18,442
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 14th day of October,

692
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:21,442
murdered Emily Jane French.

693
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:25,323
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

694
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:29,237
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

695
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:32,375
whether he be guilty or not.

696
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:40,000
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

697
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:43,670
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

698
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:46,427
You must shut out
from your minds everything

699
00:51:46,558 --> 00:51:50,141
except what will take place in this court.

700
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,805
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

701
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,475
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

702
00:51:57,611 --> 00:52:02,356
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

703
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:06,405
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

704
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,576
appear for the defence.

705
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,910
I trust we are not to be deprived

706
00:52:15,045 --> 00:52:17,963
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

707
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,420
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

708
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:25,756
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

709
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,050
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

710
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:36,608
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

711
00:52:36,734 --> 00:52:38,976
Thank you, my lord.

712
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:43,061
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

713
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,327
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

714
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:49,031
a woman of 56.

715
00:52:49,163 --> 00:52:53,576
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

716
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,283
On the night of October 14 last,

717
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,419
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

718
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:04,047
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

719
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:07,512
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

720
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:10,262
and it is the case for the prosecution

721
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:13,597
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

722
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,770
That's not true! I didn't do it!

723
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:21,195
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

724
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:25,153
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

725
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:28,071
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

726
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:33,874
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

727
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:37,785
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

728
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:40,757
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

729
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:43,967
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

730
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:06,566
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

731
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,370
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.

732
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:12,615
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

733
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,156
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

734
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:19,125
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

735
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:24,630
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

736
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,220
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

737
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:33,217
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

738
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:37,351
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

739
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,234
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

740
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,607
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

741
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,318
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

742
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,288
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

743
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:57,789
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

744
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,458
It is cocoa. So sorry.

745
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,626
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

746
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,429
Take care of this, Carter.

747
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,762
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

748
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:13,303
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

749
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,141
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

750
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:20,815
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

751
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,983
Come along, Carter.

752
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,156
From the body temperature
and other factors,

753
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:31,032
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 10pm,

754
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:36,667
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

755
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:42,917
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

756
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,208
Were there any signs of a struggle?

757
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,669
None. Just the one blow.

758
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:51,754
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

759
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:55,177
My lord, I must object.

760
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:59,686
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

761
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:03,399
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

762
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,483
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

763
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:12,570
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

764
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:14,863
Please rephrase your question.

765
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:21,037
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

766
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:25,335
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

767
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,674
My lord, I am taken by surprise

768
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:32,679
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

769
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:35,726
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

770
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:38,179
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

771
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:40,983
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

772
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:48,697
Silence! Silence!

773
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:54,912
Very well, Inspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

774
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,452
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

775
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:03,418
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

776
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:07,712
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

777
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:12,305
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

778
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,639
- No others?
- No others.

779
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:19,560
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

780
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:25,064
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

781
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:29,193
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

782
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:34,781
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

783
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:41,628
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

784
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:46,131
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

785
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:49,176
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

786
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,719
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

787
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,304
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

788
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,474
Yes, my lord.

789
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:00,015
Inspector,

790
00:58:00,148 --> 00:58:03,766
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

791
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,986
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

792
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:12,737
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

793
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:16,783
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

794
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:18,029
No, sir.

795
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:21,084
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

796
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:23,453
Is that the jacket?

797
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:30,507
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

798
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,677
Where did you find this, Inspector?

799
00:58:32,806 --> 00:58:35,379
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

800
00:58:35,517 --> 00:58:38,008
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

801
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:40,600
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

802
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:43,304
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

803
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:45,316
What tests were made?

804
00:58:45,444 --> 00:58:49,655
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

805
00:58:49,782 --> 00:58:52,189
then to classify it by group or type.

806
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:54,995
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

807
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,038
Yes, sir. It is type O.

808
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:01,451
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

809
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,911
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

810
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,747
The same. Type O.

811
00:59:07,883 --> 00:59:11,668
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

812
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:16,846
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

813
00:59:16,976 --> 00:59:19,384
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

814
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,479
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

815
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:26,981
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

816
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:29,437
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

817
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:31,779
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

818
00:59:31,908 --> 00:59:35,906
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

819
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:38,742
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

820
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:42,207
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

821
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:44,909
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

822
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:49,625
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

823
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,001
With or without gloves.

824
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:56,051
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

825
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:02,640
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

826
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:06,818
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

827
01:00:06,944 --> 01:00:11,689
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

828
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:14,576
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

829
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:18,569
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

830
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:21,078
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

831
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:25,253
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

832
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:30,006
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

833
01:00:34,222 --> 01:00:37,887
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

834
01:00:38,017 --> 01:00:42,015
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

835
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:44,602
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

836
01:00:44,732 --> 01:00:47,769
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

837
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:49,100
Yes, sir, it might.

838
01:00:49,237 --> 01:00:54,362
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

839
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:59,450
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

840
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:02,036
- That is correct.
- However,

841
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:05,618
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

842
01:01:05,754 --> 01:01:08,459
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

843
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,295
from the household accident
he described to you.

844
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:13,834
Yes, sir.

845
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,755
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, Inspector?

846
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:19,433
No, sir.

847
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:24,015
I have here a certificate

848
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:28,442
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

849
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:30,858
at the North London Hospital.

850
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:34,404
And that his blood is group O.

851
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:41,535
Thank you, Inspector.

852
01:01:44,502 --> 01:01:49,211
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

853
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,424
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

854
01:01:52,552 --> 01:01:56,632
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

855
01:01:56,764 --> 01:01:59,551
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

856
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:01,095
You may stand down.

857
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,981
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

858
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,979
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

859
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:36,089
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

860
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,968
.. the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

861
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:45,305
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

862
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:48,938
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

863
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:54,062
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

864
01:02:54,198 --> 01:02:58,694
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

865
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:02,576
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

866
01:03:02,707 --> 01:03:05,957
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

867
01:03:06,085 --> 01:03:09,252
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

868
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,666
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

869
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:18,008
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

870
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:21,259
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

871
01:03:21,392 --> 01:03:24,062
She knew me and she trusted me.

872
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:27,057
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

873
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:32,066
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

874
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:36,824
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

875
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:41,411
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

876
01:03:41,538 --> 01:03:45,785
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

877
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:49,536
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

878
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:54,084
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

879
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:57,883
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

880
01:03:58,013 --> 01:04:01,797
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

881
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:05,350
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

882
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:08,765
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

883
01:04:08,899 --> 01:04:11,224
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

884
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,567
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

885
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:20,827
No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!

886
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:22,993
Talking and laughing they were.

887
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:26,657
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

888
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:30,208
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

889
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:34,252
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

890
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:38,796
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

891
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:43,391
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

892
01:04:43,518 --> 01:04:49,521
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

893
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:57,735
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

894
01:04:57,866 --> 01:05:01,650
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

895
01:05:01,786 --> 01:05:03,826
before she went to bed.

896
01:05:03,955 --> 01:05:08,498
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

897
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:11,544
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

898
01:05:11,672 --> 01:05:13,711
My lord, I must protest!

899
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:18,004
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

900
01:05:18,136 --> 01:05:22,051
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

901
01:05:22,182 --> 01:05:25,053
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

902
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:27,225
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

903
01:05:27,354 --> 01:05:32,312
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

904
01:05:33,819 --> 01:05:36,191
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

905
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:39,821
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

906
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,450
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

907
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:48,455
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

908
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:52,629
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

909
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:56,420
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

910
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,172
Why?

911
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:04,511
Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

912
01:06:04,642 --> 01:06:08,770
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

913
01:06:11,191 --> 01:06:16,529
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

914
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:20,154
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

915
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:22,691
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

916
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:25,782
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

917
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:29,741
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

918
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:32,712
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

919
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:37,251
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

920
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:40,800
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

921
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:44,215
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

922
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:47,600
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

923
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,190
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

924
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:55,441
Would you...? Thank you.

925
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:59,947
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

926
01:07:00,074 --> 01:07:02,113
In the old will, that which was revoked,

927
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:06,075
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

928
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:07,403
That's so.

929
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:11,834
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

930
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,626
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

931
01:07:15,757 --> 01:07:19,541
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

932
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:24,007
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

933
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,714
I'm not antagonistic to him.

934
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:30,849
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

935
01:07:31,898 --> 01:07:33,938
I suggest you formed this opinion

936
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:37,851
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

937
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:42,151
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

938
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:44,988
Now. On the night of October 14

939
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,406
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

940
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,991
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

941
01:07:52,127 --> 01:07:54,665
You mean you only heard the voices?

942
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:57,632
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

943
01:07:57,758 --> 01:08:00,878
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

944
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:05,388
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

945
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:08,967
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

946
01:08:09,103 --> 01:08:12,020
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

947
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:14,852
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

948
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:17,771
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

949
01:08:17,903 --> 01:08:24,108
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

950
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:26,781
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

951
01:08:26,913 --> 01:08:31,206
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

952
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:35,414
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

953
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:38,547
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

954
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:41,925
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

955
01:08:42,053 --> 01:08:44,211
what you really heard was the television

956
01:08:44,347 --> 01:08:46,920
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

957
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:51,519
There was a play called Lover's Leap
on the television that night.

958
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:57,102
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

959
01:08:57,235 --> 01:09:02,277
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

960
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:14,792
Silence! Silence!

961
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:19,625
Odd. It's not time yet.

962
01:09:19,758 --> 01:09:22,795
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

963
01:09:22,928 --> 01:09:26,012
I have not quite finished.

964
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,766
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health Insurance Act?

965
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:34,643
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

966
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:37,810
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

967
01:09:37,943 --> 01:09:40,861
I am sure that many agree with you.

968
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:47,406
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

969
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:51,155
- .. a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

970
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,291
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

971
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:57,503
I will repeat the question, my lord.

972
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:03,585
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

973
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,596
did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?

974
01:10:08,725 --> 01:10:09,756
Yes, I did.

975
01:10:09,893 --> 01:10:12,300
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

976
01:10:12,437 --> 01:10:17,728
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

977
01:10:17,859 --> 01:10:21,062
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

978
01:10:21,196 --> 01:10:24,280
that you could distinguish the voice of...

979
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:26,614
.. the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

980
01:10:26,743 --> 01:10:28,783
Who? Who?

981
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:32,036
No further questions.

982
01:10:34,418 --> 01:10:36,790
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

983
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,000
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

984
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:46,091
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

985
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:49,175
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

986
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:55,102
Call Police Constable Jeffries.

987
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:59,525
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

988
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,914
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

989
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,118
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

990
01:11:31,393 --> 01:11:34,263
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

991
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:39,390
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

992
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:43,317
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

993
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:56,998
Christine.

994
01:12:07,846 --> 01:12:10,551
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

995
01:12:10,683 --> 01:12:14,301
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

996
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:17,058
My lord, I have the most serious objection

997
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:21,269
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

998
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:23,478
I call my learned friend's attention

999
01:12:23,613 --> 01:12:28,156
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

1000
01:12:28,284 --> 01:12:32,364
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1001
01:12:32,497 --> 01:12:36,115
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1002
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,920
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1003
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:41,004
No.

1004
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,627
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1005
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,382
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1006
01:12:48,513 --> 01:12:51,964
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1007
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,054
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1008
01:12:55,186 --> 01:13:00,810
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1009
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:06,945
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1010
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:11,783
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1011
01:13:11,912 --> 01:13:14,747
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1012
01:13:14,873 --> 01:13:20,793
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1013
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:29,552
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1014
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,139
Yes.

1015
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:35,556
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1016
01:13:35,686 --> 01:13:40,929
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1017
01:13:41,067 --> 01:13:43,688
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1018
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:48,529
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1019
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:53,320
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1020
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,039
Silence!

1021
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,208
I must have silence.

1022
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:05,631
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1023
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:08,713
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1024
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:12,973
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1025
01:14:13,099 --> 01:14:16,634
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1026
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:19,475
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1027
01:14:19,606 --> 01:14:21,812
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1028
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:24,100
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1029
01:14:24,236 --> 01:14:27,237
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1030
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:29,606
He said "I've killed her. "

1031
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:34,238
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1032
01:14:34,371 --> 01:14:38,535
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1033
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:45,247
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1034
01:14:45,382 --> 01:14:48,549
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1035
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:52,426
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1036
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:56,803
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1037
01:14:56,936 --> 01:15:00,803
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1038
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,857
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1039
01:15:03,985 --> 01:15:08,777
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1040
01:15:08,906 --> 01:15:11,741
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1041
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:16,613
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1042
01:15:16,748 --> 01:15:19,120
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1043
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,326
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1044
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:23,667
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1045
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:27,130
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1046
01:15:27,258 --> 01:15:30,010
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1047
01:15:30,136 --> 01:15:33,173
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1048
01:15:33,306 --> 01:15:36,343
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1049
01:15:36,476 --> 01:15:38,516
I never loved him.

1050
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,187
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1051
01:15:42,315 --> 01:15:45,815
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1052
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:49,479
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1053
01:15:49,614 --> 01:15:51,737
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1054
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:54,405
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1055
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:58,534
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1056
01:15:58,665 --> 01:16:01,335
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1057
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,702
Then this is the truth?

1058
01:16:03,837 --> 01:16:07,372
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1059
01:16:07,508 --> 01:16:09,584
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1060
01:16:09,718 --> 01:16:13,847
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1061
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:17,259
That is the truth.

1062
01:16:17,393 --> 01:16:20,560
That is the truth, before God?

1063
01:16:20,688 --> 01:16:22,811
That is the truth.

1064
01:16:23,316 --> 01:16:25,355
Thank you.

1065
01:16:30,573 --> 01:16:34,108
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1066
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:36,283
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1067
01:16:36,412 --> 01:16:40,457
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1068
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:45,791
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1069
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:50,418
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1070
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:53,636
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1071
01:16:53,763 --> 01:16:55,803
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1072
01:16:55,932 --> 01:16:59,017
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1073
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:02,061
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1074
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:04,430
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1075
01:17:04,566 --> 01:17:08,943
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1076
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,562
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1077
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:14,948
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1078
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:17,484
who believed himself married and loved,

1079
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:20,112
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1080
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:24,081
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1081
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:28,505
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1082
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:33,010
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1083
01:17:33,137 --> 01:17:38,013
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1084
01:17:38,142 --> 01:17:41,677
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1085
01:17:41,812 --> 01:17:45,561
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1086
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:53,566
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1087
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,029
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1088
01:17:58,162 --> 01:18:02,374
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1089
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,628
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1090
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:12,373
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1091
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:16,425
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1092
01:18:16,556 --> 01:18:20,471
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1093
01:18:20,602 --> 01:18:23,271
when she was sworn here today.

1094
01:18:23,396 --> 01:18:27,690
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1095
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:29,941
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1096
01:18:34,908 --> 01:18:39,369
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1097
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:43,115
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1098
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,326
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1099
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:47,252
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1100
01:18:47,379 --> 01:18:52,337
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1101
01:18:52,468 --> 01:18:54,923
Yes, I'm aware.

1102
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:59,799
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1103
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:03,552
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1104
01:19:03,688 --> 01:19:05,645
So help me, God.

1105
01:19:06,816 --> 01:19:11,229
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1106
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:32,837
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1107
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:37,676
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1108
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:38,755
Silence.

1109
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:44,718
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1110
01:19:46,898 --> 01:19:50,682
My lord, members of the jury,

1111
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:55,980
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1112
01:19:56,116 --> 01:20:00,494
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1113
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:04,156
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne,

1114
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:09,368
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1115
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:14,416
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1116
01:20:14,552 --> 01:20:18,502
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1117
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,177
you will decide for yourselves.

1118
01:20:22,226 --> 01:20:25,346
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1119
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:29,643
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1120
01:20:29,776 --> 01:20:32,101
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1121
01:20:32,236 --> 01:20:37,907
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of $80,000,

1122
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:40,821
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1123
01:20:40,954 --> 01:20:44,786
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1124
01:20:45,834 --> 01:20:49,831
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1125
01:20:49,963 --> 01:20:52,833
in both these... mishaps.

1126
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:59,506
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1127
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:04,301
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1128
01:21:04,436 --> 01:21:09,145
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1129
01:21:09,274 --> 01:21:13,023
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1130
01:21:13,153 --> 01:21:15,644
harmful to her husband.

1131
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:22,448
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1132
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:28,748
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1133
01:21:28,878 --> 01:21:31,748
For what it is worth.

1134
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:37,795
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1135
01:21:37,928 --> 01:21:42,009
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1136
01:21:42,141 --> 01:21:46,091
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1137
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:51,934
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1138
01:21:52,068 --> 01:21:54,939
on this tragic riddle.

1139
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:58,070
The prisoner himself.

1140
01:21:59,534 --> 01:22:01,692
Members of the jury,

1141
01:22:01,828 --> 01:22:05,411
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1142
01:22:24,684 --> 01:22:28,018
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1143
01:22:28,146 --> 01:22:31,313
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1144
01:22:32,526 --> 01:22:36,689
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1145
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:39,906
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1146
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:45,324
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1147
01:22:45,456 --> 01:22:47,698
murder Emily Jane French?

1148
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:52,206
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1149
01:22:54,381 --> 01:22:58,842
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1150
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:04,260
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1151
01:23:04,392 --> 01:23:06,883
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1152
01:23:07,019 --> 01:23:10,602
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1153
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:13,602
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1154
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:16,771
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1155
01:23:16,904 --> 01:23:19,775
the prisoner will withstand it.

1156
01:23:21,284 --> 01:23:24,949
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1157
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:27,119
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1158
01:23:27,248 --> 01:23:29,324
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1159
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:30,241
No.

1160
01:23:30,377 --> 01:23:32,583
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1161
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:37,624
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of $80,000?

1162
01:23:37,759 --> 01:23:38,957
No, I didn't.

1163
01:23:39,094 --> 01:23:43,970
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1164
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:47,385
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1165
01:23:48,353 --> 01:23:52,018
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1166
01:23:53,692 --> 01:23:54,688
Yes, sir.

1167
01:23:54,818 --> 01:24:00,026
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1168
01:24:00,157 --> 01:24:03,407
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1169
01:24:03,535 --> 01:24:06,739
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1170
01:24:06,872 --> 01:24:09,446
at the times that he has stated.

1171
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:13,035
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1172
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:15,542
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1173
01:24:15,673 --> 01:24:18,876
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1174
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:23,672
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1175
01:24:23,806 --> 01:24:29,227
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1176
01:24:29,353 --> 01:24:33,647
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1177
01:24:33,775 --> 01:24:37,819
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1178
01:24:37,946 --> 01:24:41,231
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1179
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:45,494
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1180
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:50,662
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1181
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:56,035
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1182
01:24:56,172 --> 01:24:58,580
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1183
01:24:59,384 --> 01:25:01,460
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1184
01:25:01,595 --> 01:25:06,055
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1185
01:25:06,183 --> 01:25:08,140
Oh.

1186
01:25:08,894 --> 01:25:13,472
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1187
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:15,765
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1188
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:19,151
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1189
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,657
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1190
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:26,156
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1191
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,371
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1192
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:31,705
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1193
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:35,001
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1194
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:37,252
We had a drink and walked out together.

1195
01:25:37,381 --> 01:25:43,420
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1196
01:25:43,554 --> 01:25:48,845
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1197
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:52,844
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1198
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,396
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1199
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:00,025
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1200
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:04,318
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit $80,000!

1201
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:08,994
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1202
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:13,535
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1203
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:17,618
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1204
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,211
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1205
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,922
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1206
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:28,887
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1207
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:34,844
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1208
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,603
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1209
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:42,231
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1210
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,902
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1211
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:49,114
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1212
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:52,164
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1213
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:55,209
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1214
01:26:55,336 --> 01:27:00,128
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1215
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:03,424
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1216
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:07,930
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1217
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:11,343
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1218
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:14,478
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1219
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:16,645
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1220
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:19,692
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1221
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:22,026
You came home at ten past ten!

1222
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:26,532
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1223
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:28,866
You killed Emily French!

1224
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,320
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1225
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:35,324
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1226
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:40,039
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1227
01:27:45,721 --> 01:27:48,176
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1228
01:27:48,307 --> 01:27:50,548
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1229
01:27:50,684 --> 01:27:56,023
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1230
01:27:57,065 --> 01:27:58,061
What?

1231
01:27:58,192 --> 01:28:02,735
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1232
01:28:02,863 --> 01:28:06,908
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1233
01:28:07,034 --> 01:28:10,450
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1234
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:15,122
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1235
01:28:15,251 --> 01:28:18,205
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1236
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:23,999
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1237
01:28:24,135 --> 01:28:28,464
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1238
01:28:30,516 --> 01:28:34,135
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1239
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:38,517
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1240
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,900
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1241
01:28:42,028 --> 01:28:42,858
No.

1242
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:45,775
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1243
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:47,235
I'm not sure.

1244
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:51,115
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1245
01:28:51,246 --> 01:28:56,287
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1246
01:28:56,877 --> 01:29:02,037
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1247
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:05,091
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1248
01:29:05,218 --> 01:29:08,753
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1249
01:29:08,889 --> 01:29:12,637
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1250
01:29:12,768 --> 01:29:16,600
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1251
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,601
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1252
01:29:19,733 --> 01:29:23,778
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1253
01:29:23,904 --> 01:29:28,234
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1254
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:39,209
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

1255
01:29:39,337 --> 01:29:42,753
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

1256
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:47,259
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1257
01:29:47,386 --> 01:29:50,921
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1258
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:54,343
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1259
01:29:54,477 --> 01:29:55,722
Well, really, madam!

1260
01:29:55,853 --> 01:29:58,854
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1261
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:02,682
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1262
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:05,061
It's about that German Wife.

1263
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:08,731
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.

1264
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:14,450
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1265
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:16,906
Well, hello, ducky.

1266
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,959
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1267
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:23,954
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and White.

1268
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:27,045
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1269
01:30:27,177 --> 01:30:30,676
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1270
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:34,222
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1271
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:37,637
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1272
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,309
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1273
01:30:40,441 --> 01:30:42,599
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1274
01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:46,982
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1275
01:30:47,615 --> 01:30:50,948
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1276
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:58,618
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1277
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:03,294
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1278
01:31:03,422 --> 01:31:05,249
Balderdash.

1279
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:10,839
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1280
01:31:10,972 --> 01:31:13,842
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1281
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:17,059
Euston Station, where do you think?

1282
01:31:18,688 --> 01:31:20,681
Now, sir?

1283
01:31:20,815 --> 01:31:22,642
Shortly.

1284
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:25,110
Cigar!

1285
01:31:26,029 --> 01:31:28,068
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1286
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:32,907
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1287
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:35,076
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1288
01:32:01,065 --> 01:32:04,101
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1289
01:32:04,235 --> 01:32:08,980
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1290
01:32:09,114 --> 01:32:11,440
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1291
01:32:11,575 --> 01:32:14,113
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1292
01:32:14,245 --> 01:32:17,281
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1293
01:32:17,415 --> 01:32:22,871
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1294
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:27,251
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'Imen friends.

1295
01:32:27,383 --> 01:32:29,957
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1296
01:32:30,094 --> 01:32:34,555
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1297
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:39,309
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1298
01:32:39,437 --> 01:32:43,933
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1299
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:48,895
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1300
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:52,945
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1301
01:32:53,076 --> 01:32:58,237
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1302
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:01,125
Well, I don't expect you...

1303
01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:08,382
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1304
01:33:08,508 --> 01:33:13,052
If these letters get the boy off,
it's $100 for me, right?

1305
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:18,056
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer $10.

1306
01:33:18,185 --> 01:33:21,601
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1307
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:24,565
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1308
01:33:24,692 --> 01:33:26,815
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1309
01:33:26,944 --> 01:33:30,479
$20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1310
01:33:30,614 --> 01:33:33,651
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1311
01:33:33,784 --> 01:33:36,156
- $40.
- All right, blast yer.

1312
01:33:36,287 --> 01:33:39,157
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1313
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,329
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1314
01:33:41,459 --> 01:33:45,788
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1315
01:33:48,383 --> 01:33:51,253
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1316
01:33:53,137 --> 01:33:57,005
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1317
01:33:57,141 --> 01:33:59,597
Good heavens, look at this.

1318
01:34:02,188 --> 01:34:04,228
Juicy, ain't they?

1319
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:08,307
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1320
01:34:08,445 --> 01:34:11,529
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1321
01:34:11,656 --> 01:34:14,823
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1322
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:18,367
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1323
01:34:19,456 --> 01:34:21,912
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1324
01:34:25,587 --> 01:34:26,369
Ha!

1325
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:30,455
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1326
01:34:30,592 --> 01:34:35,550
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1327
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:40,675
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1328
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:46,232
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1329
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:50,736
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1330
01:34:50,863 --> 01:34:56,617
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1331
01:34:56,744 --> 01:35:01,655
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1332
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:07,082
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another $5 for the letters.

1333
01:35:07,213 --> 01:35:11,542
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1334
01:35:11,676 --> 01:35:15,259
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1335
01:35:17,223 --> 01:35:19,797
Unbelievable.

1336
01:35:19,934 --> 01:35:24,228
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1337
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:26,348
Miss, um...

1338
01:35:26,483 --> 01:35:28,356
Where is she?

1339
01:35:34,366 --> 01:35:40,155
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1340
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:44,617
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1341
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:46,791
Good idea.

1342
01:35:55,804 --> 01:35:57,298
Silence!

1343
01:35:57,431 --> 01:35:59,554
Be upstanding in court.

1344
01:36:00,601 --> 01:36:03,306
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1345
01:36:03,437 --> 01:36:05,560
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1346
01:36:05,689 --> 01:36:09,687
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1347
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:14,148
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1348
01:36:28,004 --> 01:36:31,289
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1349
01:36:31,424 --> 01:36:33,832
it has the right to be heard last.

1350
01:36:33,968 --> 01:36:40,256
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1351
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:44,769
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1352
01:36:44,896 --> 01:36:49,605
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1353
01:36:49,734 --> 01:36:53,150
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1354
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,481
I will briefly summarise these facts...

1355
01:37:03,248 --> 01:37:05,537
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1356
01:37:06,126 --> 01:37:10,420
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1357
01:37:10,547 --> 01:37:15,008
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1358
01:37:15,135 --> 01:37:20,130
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1359
01:37:20,265 --> 01:37:24,133
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1360
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:27,520
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1361
01:37:27,648 --> 01:37:31,064
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1362
01:37:31,193 --> 01:37:34,977
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1363
01:37:35,114 --> 01:37:40,903
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1364
01:37:41,037 --> 01:37:43,444
at page 463.

1365
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:47,828
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1366
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,376
1942 at page 153.

1367
01:37:51,506 --> 01:37:54,376
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1368
01:37:54,509 --> 01:37:58,589
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1369
01:37:58,721 --> 01:38:01,295
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1370
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:06,141
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1371
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:08,513
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1372
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:10,724
Letters, my lord.

1373
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:13,943
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1374
01:38:16,281 --> 01:38:19,864
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1375
01:38:19,993 --> 01:38:23,528
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1376
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:27,412
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1377
01:38:29,294 --> 01:38:32,877
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1378
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:37,550
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1379
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:40,845
As yours is now, by me.

1380
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:49,436
Call Christine Helm.

1381
01:38:50,232 --> 01:38:51,892
Christine Helm.

1382
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,813
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1383
01:39:11,421 --> 01:39:16,415
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1384
01:39:16,551 --> 01:39:20,549
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1385
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,878
Yes.

1386
01:39:22,015 --> 01:39:27,721
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1387
01:39:27,854 --> 01:39:31,852
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1388
01:39:31,983 --> 01:39:34,272
Max? Certainly not.

1389
01:39:34,402 --> 01:39:38,234
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1390
01:39:38,365 --> 01:39:40,856
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1391
01:39:40,992 --> 01:39:47,873
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1392
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:52,455
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1393
01:39:52,588 --> 01:39:54,913
I suggest that on October 20

1394
01:39:55,049 --> 01:39:58,382
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1395
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:02,010
- .. addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1396
01:40:02,139 --> 01:40:06,219
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1397
01:40:07,061 --> 01:40:09,184
Lies! All lies!

1398
01:40:09,313 --> 01:40:13,441
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1399
01:40:13,567 --> 01:40:16,319
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1400
01:40:16,445 --> 01:40:21,950
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1401
01:40:22,076 --> 01:40:26,952
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1402
01:40:27,081 --> 01:40:30,035
"I believe all our difficulties
may be ended. "

1403
01:40:30,168 --> 01:40:32,741
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1404
01:40:32,879 --> 01:40:36,711
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1405
01:40:36,841 --> 01:40:39,130
- It isn't?
- No!

1406
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:42,676
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1407
01:40:46,768 --> 01:40:48,310
Like this?

1408
01:40:51,022 --> 01:40:56,361
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1409
01:40:57,946 --> 01:41:02,407
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him
and that's what he is.

1410
01:41:02,534 --> 01:41:06,863
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough
to identify your letter paper.

1411
01:41:06,997 --> 01:41:11,908
Now, if you like, I can have an expert
identify your handwriting.

1412
01:41:12,044 --> 01:41:13,918
Damn you!

1413
01:41:14,421 --> 01:41:17,422
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1414
01:41:17,549 --> 01:41:19,756
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1415
01:41:19,885 --> 01:41:23,385
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!

1416
01:41:23,514 --> 01:41:24,925
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1417
01:41:25,057 --> 01:41:27,762
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1418
01:41:34,066 --> 01:41:40,271
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1419
01:41:45,328 --> 01:41:50,619
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1420
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:54,415
"All our difficulties may soon be solved. "

1421
01:41:54,546 --> 01:41:59,623
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about. "

1422
01:41:59,759 --> 01:42:05,595
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone. "

1423
01:42:06,641 --> 01:42:12,893
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1424
01:42:13,023 --> 01:42:16,890
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1425
01:42:17,027 --> 01:42:20,941
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1426
01:42:21,073 --> 01:42:24,524
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him. "

1427
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:28,278
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1428
01:42:28,413 --> 01:42:32,281
because they will take him away forever

1429
01:42:32,418 --> 01:42:37,163
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved. "

1430
01:42:37,297 --> 01:42:42,125
"I count the hours until
we are together. Christine. "

1431
01:42:45,181 --> 01:42:49,130
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1432
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:04,563
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1433
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:07,951
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1434
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:12,207
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1435
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:14,125
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1436
01:43:14,252 --> 01:43:19,626
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1437
01:43:19,758 --> 01:43:23,340
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1438
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:27,088
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1439
01:43:27,223 --> 01:43:30,972
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1440
01:43:31,102 --> 01:43:34,803
then now is the time to state this fact.

1441
01:43:37,317 --> 01:43:39,476
I wrote the letter.

1442
01:43:41,989 --> 01:43:45,903
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1443
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:57,167
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1444
01:43:57,296 --> 01:43:59,454
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1445
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:03,718
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1446
01:44:03,844 --> 01:44:05,042
I concede.

1447
01:44:05,179 --> 01:44:08,382
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1448
01:44:08,516 --> 01:44:12,015
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1449
01:44:12,144 --> 01:44:15,560
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1450
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:19,818
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1451
01:44:19,944 --> 01:44:23,194
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1452
01:44:23,322 --> 01:44:27,486
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1453
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:29,529
Come along.

1454
01:44:30,496 --> 01:44:32,536
Where's my wig?

1455
01:45:01,486 --> 01:45:03,942
The prisoner will stand up.

1456
01:45:06,491 --> 01:45:11,450
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1457
01:45:12,998 --> 01:45:14,243
We are.

1458
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:18,622
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1459
01:45:18,754 --> 01:45:23,297
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1460
01:45:27,221 --> 01:45:28,632
Not guilty, m'lord.

1461
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:49,988
Silence!

1462
01:45:50,244 --> 01:45:51,988
Silence!

1463
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:58,700
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1464
01:45:58,837 --> 01:46:03,415
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1465
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:08,046
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1466
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:22,274
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1467
01:46:22,402 --> 01:46:24,644
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1468
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:29,738
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1469
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:42,161
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1470
01:46:42,298 --> 01:46:44,789
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1471
01:46:44,925 --> 01:46:48,341
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1472
01:46:48,471 --> 01:46:52,303
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1473
01:46:52,433 --> 01:46:56,265
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1474
01:46:56,395 --> 01:46:59,515
"Mr Vole. " They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1475
01:46:59,649 --> 01:47:04,809
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1476
01:47:14,289 --> 01:47:17,539
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1477
01:47:17,667 --> 01:47:19,790
and the other on a banana peel.

1478
01:47:19,919 --> 01:47:23,123
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1479
01:47:23,256 --> 01:47:26,257
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1480
01:47:26,384 --> 01:47:30,464
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1481
01:47:44,069 --> 01:47:48,731
- Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1482
01:47:48,866 --> 01:47:52,199
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1483
01:47:52,327 --> 01:47:54,367
Thank you.

1484
01:47:58,125 --> 01:48:01,411
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1485
01:48:01,545 --> 01:48:07,085
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1486
01:48:07,218 --> 01:48:11,595
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1487
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:42,621
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1488
01:48:42,754 --> 01:48:45,292
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1489
01:48:45,423 --> 01:48:49,338
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1490
01:48:49,469 --> 01:48:51,794
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1491
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:56,224
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1492
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:58,558
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1493
01:48:58,687 --> 01:49:02,305
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1494
01:49:02,441 --> 01:49:06,770
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1495
01:49:06,904 --> 01:49:10,522
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1496
01:49:10,657 --> 01:49:14,655
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1497
01:49:14,787 --> 01:49:17,906
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1498
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:22,749
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1499
01:49:22,878 --> 01:49:28,632
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1500
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:31,427
What are you driving at?

1501
01:49:31,554 --> 01:49:34,508
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1502
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,051
- We?
- Remember?

1503
01:49:36,183 --> 01:49:39,849
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1504
01:49:39,979 --> 01:49:44,059
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1505
01:49:44,192 --> 01:49:45,769
What idea?

1506
01:49:45,902 --> 01:49:50,398
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1507
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:54,481
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1508
01:49:54,619 --> 01:49:58,866
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1509
01:49:58,998 --> 01:50:02,699
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1510
01:50:08,008 --> 01:50:12,219
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1511
01:50:12,345 --> 01:50:15,015
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1512
01:50:18,769 --> 01:50:22,849
I suspected something, but not that.

1513
01:50:22,981 --> 01:50:25,982
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1514
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:29,858
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1515
01:50:29,988 --> 01:50:32,859
All those blue letters!

1516
01:50:32,991 --> 01:50:36,610
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1517
01:50:36,745 --> 01:50:39,201
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1518
01:50:39,331 --> 01:50:41,573
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1519
01:50:41,709 --> 01:50:45,659
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1520
01:50:45,796 --> 01:50:48,714
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1521
01:50:48,841 --> 01:50:52,008
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1522
01:50:52,136 --> 01:50:55,422
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1523
01:50:55,556 --> 01:50:58,012
I knew he was guilty.

1524
01:51:01,437 --> 01:51:04,391
That can't be true! No!

1525
01:51:05,608 --> 01:51:08,016
Listen to me, once and for all.

1526
01:51:08,152 --> 01:51:10,857
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1527
01:51:10,989 --> 01:51:14,440
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1528
01:51:14,576 --> 01:51:17,695
And you saved him? A murderer?

1529
01:51:17,829 --> 01:51:19,952
Again, you don't understand.

1530
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:22,121
I love him.

1531
01:51:27,923 --> 01:51:30,295
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1532
01:51:30,425 --> 01:51:32,050
Leonard!

1533
01:51:32,177 --> 01:51:35,344
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1534
01:51:35,472 --> 01:51:37,512
Leonard, Leonard.

1535
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:45,064
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1536
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:50,861
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1537
01:51:50,988 --> 01:51:54,487
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1538
01:51:54,616 --> 01:51:57,867
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1539
01:51:57,995 --> 01:52:02,574
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1540
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:05,413
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1541
01:52:05,544 --> 01:52:08,664
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1542
01:52:08,798 --> 01:52:12,961
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1543
01:52:13,094 --> 01:52:17,637
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1544
01:52:17,765 --> 01:52:20,719
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1545
01:52:20,852 --> 01:52:24,434
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1546
01:52:24,564 --> 01:52:29,558
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1547
01:52:29,694 --> 01:52:33,395
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be $5,000 for the defence.

1548
01:52:33,531 --> 01:52:38,277
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1549
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:43,369
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1550
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,698
What is it, Leonard?

1551
01:52:44,834 --> 01:52:48,702
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1552
01:52:48,838 --> 01:52:51,412
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1553
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:52,878
Len!

1554
01:52:53,009 --> 01:52:54,669
Oh, Len!

1555
01:52:54,803 --> 01:52:56,427
Len...

1556
01:52:58,056 --> 01:53:01,757
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1557
01:53:01,893 --> 01:53:04,385
Leonard, who's this girl?

1558
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:07,226
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1559
01:53:07,357 --> 01:53:09,184
Tell her, Len.

1560
01:53:09,318 --> 01:53:12,817
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1561
01:53:12,946 --> 01:53:16,113
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1562
01:53:16,241 --> 01:53:20,904
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1563
01:53:21,038 --> 01:53:25,332
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1564
01:53:25,459 --> 01:53:31,379
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1565
01:53:31,507 --> 01:53:36,502
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1566
01:53:36,637 --> 01:53:39,342
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1567
01:53:39,474 --> 01:53:42,428
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1568
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,763
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1569
01:53:45,897 --> 01:53:50,440
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1570
01:53:50,568 --> 01:53:53,439
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1571
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:58,150
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1572
01:53:58,284 --> 01:54:00,573
And you know what that means.

1573
01:54:00,704 --> 01:54:05,366
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1574
01:54:06,376 --> 01:54:09,045
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1575
01:54:09,171 --> 01:54:11,163
let them try me for...!

1576
01:54:11,298 --> 01:54:13,125
Argh!

1577
01:54:34,697 --> 01:54:39,240
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1578
01:54:40,286 --> 01:54:42,693
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1579
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,823
Killed him?

1580
01:54:44,957 --> 01:54:47,199
She executed him.

1581
01:54:48,836 --> 01:54:51,409
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1582
01:54:51,547 --> 01:54:57,253
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1583
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:07,759
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1584
01:55:07,897 --> 01:55:11,681
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1585
01:55:11,818 --> 01:55:14,902
We are not going yet, are we?

1586
01:55:17,323 --> 01:55:20,194
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1587
01:55:20,326 --> 01:55:22,996
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1588
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:27,415
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1589
01:55:27,542 --> 01:55:29,369
Sir Wilfrid?

1590
01:55:29,503 --> 01:55:32,172
You've forgotten your brandy.

1591
01:55:54,862 --> 01:55:56,771
The management of this theatre suggests

1592
01:55:56,905 --> 01:56:01,153
that for the greater entertainment of
