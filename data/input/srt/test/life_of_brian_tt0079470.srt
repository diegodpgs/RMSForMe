1
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,360
Who are you?
We are three wise men.

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,200
What?
We are three wise men.

3
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,760
Well, what are you doing creeping around
a cow shed at 2:00 in the morning?

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,520
That doesn't sound
very wise to me.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
We are astrologers.
We have come from the east.

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,120
Is this some kind of joke?

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
We wish to praise the infant.

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,080
We must pay homage to him.

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Homage? You're drunk!
It's disgusting!

10
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,480
Out the door! Out! Bashing me with
tales about Oriental fortunetellers.

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,800
Come on, out!
No, no. We must see him.

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,280
Go and praise someone else's brat.
We were led by a star.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,440
Led by a bottle,
more like. Go on out.

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,600
We must see him.
We have brought presents.

15
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Out!
Gold, frankincense, myrrh.

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,840
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,120
Sorry the place
is a bit of a mess.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
Well, what is myrrh anyway?
It is a valuable balm.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,360
A balm? What are you giving him
a balm for? It might bite him.

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,560
What?
That's a dangerous animal.

21
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,920
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,720
It's great big and
No, it is an ointment.

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, there is an animal
called a balm... or did I dream it?

24
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,480
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he, then?

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Hmm?
What star sign is he?

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,800
Well, Capricorn.
Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,400
He is the Son of God,
our Messiah.

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
King of the Jews!

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,800
That's Capricorn, is it?
No, that's just him.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise
there would be a lot of them.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,400
By what name are you calling him?
Uh, Brian.

32
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,120
We worship you, O Brian,
who are lord over us all.

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,480
Praise unto you, Brian, and
to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
You do a lot of this, then?
What?

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
This praising.
No, no, no, no.

36
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,880
Well, if you're
dropping by again, do pop in.

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,600
And thanks a lot for
the gold and frankincense.

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,120
But don't worry too much
about the myrrh next time, all right?

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
Thank you.
Goodbye.

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,800
Well, weren't they nice?

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,280
Out of their bloody minds,
but still... Iook at that!

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Here! Here!

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,920
That That's mine!
Hey, he's a baby! Oh!

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,800
Shut up!

45
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,160
" Brian "

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,320
" The babe they called Brian "

47
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,760
" He grew "

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,120
" Grew, grew and grew "

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,480
" Grew up to be "

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,800
" Grew up to be "

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,120
" A boy called Brian "

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,320
" A boy called Brian "

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,560
" He had arms and legs "

54
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,920
" And hands and feet "

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,440
" This boy "

56
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,720
" Whose name was Brian "

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,000
" And he grew "

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,400
" Grew, grew and grew "

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,400
" Grew up to be "

60
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
" Yes, he grew up to be "

61
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,200
" A teenager called Brian "

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,080
" A teenager called Brian "

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,480
" And his face became spotty "

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,080
" Yes, his face became spotty "

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,560
" And his voice
dropped down low "

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,040
" And things started to grow "

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,280
" On young Brian and show "

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,160
" He was certainly no "

69
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,600
" No girl named Brian "

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,240
" Not a girl named Brian "

71
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,080
" And he started to shave "

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,800
" And have one off the wrist "

73
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,640
" And want to see girls "

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,320
" And go out and get pissed "

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,600
" A man called Brian "

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,080
" This man called Brian "

77
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,960
" The man they called Brian "

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,920
" This man called "

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:37,200
" Bri "

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Aah!

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,520
How blessed are those who know
that He's a god.

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,160
How blessed are the sorrowful.
They shall find consolation.

83
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,280
How blessed are those
of gentle spirit.

84
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,360
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,880
How blessed are those
who hunger and thirst...

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
to see right prevail.

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
They shall be satisfied.

88
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,880
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

89
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,520
They shall see God.

90
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,680
Speak up!
Shhh. Quiet, Mum.

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,520
Well, I can't hear a thing.
Let's go to the stoning.

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
Shhh!
We can go to a stoning anytime.

93
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, come on, Brian.
Will you be quiet?

94
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,280
Don't pick your nose.

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
I wasn't picking my nose.
I was scratching.

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,560
You was picking it
while you was talking to that lady.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,080
I wasn't.
Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,800
Do you mind?
I can't hear a word he's saying.

99
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,360
Don't you "do you mind" me!
I was talking to my husband.

100
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,880
Well, go and talk to him somewhere else.
I can't hear a bloody thing.

101
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't you swear at my wife.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,240
I was only asking her to shut up so
we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.

103
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,760
Don't you call my husband "Big Nose".
Well, he has got a big nose.

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,120
Could you be quiet, please?
What was that?

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,520
I was too busy
talking to Big Nose.

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers".

107
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,520
What's so special
about the cheese makers?

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,160
Well, obviously, it's not meant
to be taken literally.

109
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,920
See, if you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, Big Nose.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,920
Hey! Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in.

112
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,360
Better keep listening. Might be a bit
about, "Blessed are the Big Noses".

113
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, lay off him.

114
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh, you're not so bad
yourself, Conch Face.

115
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,760
Where are you two from,
Nose City?

116
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,760
One more time, mate, I'll
take you to fuckin' cleaners!

117
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
Language!
And don't pick your nose.

118
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,920
I wasn't gonna pick my nose.
I was gonna thump him!

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,920
Hear that? "Blessed are the Greek".
The Greek?

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
Well, apparently
he's going to inherit the earth.

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Did anyone catch his name?
You're not gonna thump anybody.

122
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,280
I'll thump him
if he calls me "Big Nose" again.

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, shut up, Big Nose.
Oh! Right. I warned you.

124
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,280
I really will slug you so hard
Oh, it's the meek!

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
"Blessed are the meek"!
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm glad they're getting something,
'cause they have a hell of a time.

127
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,000
Listen, I'm only telling the truth.
You have got a very big nose.

128
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide
across your face when I'm finished!

129
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,960
Shhh!
Who hit yours, then?
Goliath's big brother?

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh. Right.
That's your last warning.

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,520
Oh, do pipe down.

132
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Silly bitch.
Get in the way on me.

133
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,120
Oh, come on.
Let's go to the stoning.

134
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,320
All right.

135
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,640
Blessed is just about anyone with
a vested interest in the status quo.

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
Well, what Jesus fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

137
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,560
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg.
Yes, I see.

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,040
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna
stone him before we get there.

139
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,960
All right.

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,120
That's disgusting.

141
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,960
It's the chap with a big nose's fault.
He started it all.

142
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.

143
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,600
Why aren't women allowed
to go to stonings, Mum?

144
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,840
It's written, that's why.

145
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,600
Beard, madame?

146
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,280
Oh, look, I haven't got time
to go to no stonings.

147
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
He's not well again.

148
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,520
Stone, sir?

149
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,120
No, they got them up there,
lying around on the ground.

150
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh, not like these, sir.
Look at this.

151
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,360
Feel the quality of that.
That's craftsmanship, sir.

152
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,200
Well, all right. We'll have two
with points and a big, flat one.

153
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,400
Can I have a flat one, Mum?
Shhh!

154
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Sorry. Dad.
All right.

155
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,440
Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

156
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,880
Packet of gravel. Should be
a good one this afternoon.

157
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
Who?
Local boy.

158
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, good.
Enjoy yourselves.

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,960
Matthias, son
of Deuteronomy of Gath?

160
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,360
Do I say yes? Yes.
Yes.

161
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,080
You have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

162
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,240
of uttering
the name of our Lord.

163
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,120
And so as a blasphemer...

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
you are to be stoned to death.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,360
Look, I'd had a lovely supper,

166
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,560
and all I said to my wife was,

167
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,360
"That piece of halibut
was good enough for Jehovah".

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,600
Blasphemy! He said it again!

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Did you hear him?

170
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,440
Really!

171
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
Are there any women
here today?

172
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Very well. By virtue
of the authority vested in me

173
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,800
Ow! Lay off!
We haven't started yet!

174
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,960
Come on!
Who threw that?

175
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,640
Who threw that stone?
Come on.

176
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,800
She did! She did!

177
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,960
He did! He did!

178
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,320
Sorry. I thought
we'd started.

179
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,640
Go to the back.

180
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
Always one, isn't there?
Now, where were we?

181
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,160
Look, I don't think it ought to be
blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah".

182
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,400
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

183
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Making it worse?
How could it be worse?

184
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,200
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

185
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm warning you, if you say
"Jehovah" once more

186
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,320
Right.
Who threw that?

187
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,040
Come on.
Who threw that?

188
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,320
Him, him, him.

189
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,360
Was it you?
Yes.

190
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
Right
Well, you did say "Jehovah".

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,520
Stop! Will you stop that?

192
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,480
Stop it! Now, look!
No one is to stone anyone...

193
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,800
until I blow this whistle.

194
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,400
Do you understand? Even and I want
to make this absolutely clear

195
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,840
Even if they do say "Jehovah".

196
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,480
Good shot! Bravo!

197
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
Have I got a big nose, Mum?
Oh, stop thinking about sex.

198
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,120
I wasn't!
You're always on about it,
morning, noon and night.

199
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,040
"Will the girls like this?
Will the girls like that?

200
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,760
Is it too big?
ls it too small?"

201
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,040
Here you are, mate.

202
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Bless you, sir.
Alms for the poor.

203
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,760
Alms for a leper.
Alms for an exleper.

204
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,800
Bloody donkey owners.
All the same, ain't they?

205
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,400
Never have any change.
Oh, here's a touch.

206
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,960
Spare a talent for an old exleper?
Buzz off!

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,360
Spare a talent
for an old exleper?

208
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
A talent?
That's more than he earns in a month!

209
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
Half a talent, then.
Now, go away!

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
Come on, Big Nose, let's haggle.
What?

211
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,400
You open at one shekel.
I start at 2,000. We close about 1,800.

212
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,400
No.
1,750?

213
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Go away!
1,740?

214
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,400
Leave him alone!
All right, two shekels.
Isn't this fun, eh?

215
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Look, he's not giving you
any money, so piss off!

216
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,760
All right. Half a shekel
for an old exleper?
Did you say "exleper"?

217
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,560
Sixteen years behind the bell,
and proud of it, sir.

218
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,280
Well, what happened?
I were cured, sir.

219
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,640
Cured?
Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.

220
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,480
Well, who cured you?
Jesus did, sir.

221
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,080
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

222
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,560
All of a sudden,
up he comes, cures me!

223
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,600
One minute,
I'm a leper with a trade;

224
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,720
next minute,
my livelihood's gone.

225
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,480
"You're cured, mate".
Bloody dogooder.

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,160
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

227
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,880
I could do that, sir.
Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,640
I was gonna ask him if he'd
make me a bit lame in one leg
during the middle of the week.

229
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,320
You know, something beggable but not
leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

230
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,120
Brian! Come and clean
your room out!

231
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,280
There you are.
Thank you, sir. Thank

232
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,240
Half a denary?
Me bloody life story.

233
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,440
There's no pleasing
some people.

234
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,560
That's just
what Jesus said, sir.

235
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh!
Good afternoon.

236
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh, uh, hello, officer.

237
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,840
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

238
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,600
What's he doing here?
Don't start that, Brian.
Go and clean your room out.

239
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,200
Bloody Romans!
Now look, Brian.

240
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,840
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have all this.

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,360
And don't you forget it.
We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.

242
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, that's not entirely true.
What do you mean?

243
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,200
Well, you know you were
asking me about your
My nose?

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,440
Yes. Well, there's a reason
it's like it is, Brian.

245
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,440
What is it?

246
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,400
Well, I suppose I should've
told you a long time ago

247
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
What?
Well, Brian...

248
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,960
your father
isn't Mr. Cohen.

249
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Well, I never thought he was.
None of your cheek!

250
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
He was a Roman, Brian.

251
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,480
He was a centurion
in the Roman army.

252
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,640
You mean you were raped?
Well, at first, yes.

253
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Who was it?
Naughtius Maximus, his name was.

254
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,320
Promised me
the known world, he did.

255
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,320
I was to be taken to Rome,
housed by the Forum

256
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,560
slaves, asses' milk,

257
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,920
as much gold as I could eat.

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Then he, having his way
with me, he had

259
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,800
Vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct!
The bastard!

260
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
Yeah, so next time you go on
about the bloody Romans,

261
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,080
don't forget
you're one of 'em!

262
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm not a Roman, Mum!
And I never will be!

263
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm a kike, a Yid,
a hebe, a hooknose!

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,240
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian, and proud of it!

265
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,360
Sex, sex, sex. That's all
they think about, huh?

266
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,720
Well, how are you,
then, officer?

267
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest...

268
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,800
is between...

269
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,560
Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian babycrusher,

270
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,320
and Boris Mineburg.

271
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,920
Larks' tongues.
Wren's livers.

272
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,320
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

273
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em
while they're hot. They're lovely.

274
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,920
Dromedary pretzels, only half a denar.
Tuscany fried bats.

275
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,880
I do feel, Reg, that any
antilmperialist group like ours...

276
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

277
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,760
Oh, great. Francis?
Yeah, I think Judith's point
of view is very valid, Reg,

278
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,800
provided the movement
never forgets...

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,240
that it is the inalienable
right of every man
Or woman.

280
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
or woman
to rid himself

281
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Or herself.
or herself

282
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,600
Agreed.
Thank you, brother.

283
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,600
Or sister.
Or sister.

284
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Where was I?

285
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,560
I think you finished.
Oh, right.

286
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,480
Furthermore, it is
the birthright of every man

287
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Or woman.
Why don't you shut up about women?

288
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,840
Women have a perfect right
to play a part in our movement.

289
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,160
Why are you always on
about women, Stan?

290
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
I want to be one.

291
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,120
What?
I want to be a woman.

292
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,160
From now on, I want you all
to call me "Loretta".

293
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,440
What?
It's my right as a man.

294
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,200
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

295
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,880
I want to have babies.

296
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,560
You want to have babies?

297
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,320
It's every man's right
to have babies if he wants them.

298
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,160
But you can't have babies.
Don't you oppress me.

299
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm not oppressing you.
You haven't got a womb.

300
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,800
Where is the fetus
gonna gestate?

301
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,280
You're gonna keep it
in a box?

302
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
Here, I've got an idea.

303
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Suppose you agree that
he can't actually have babies,

304
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,400
not having a womb which is
nobody's fault, not even the Romans'

305
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
but that he can have
the right to have babies?

306
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors...

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,440
for your right to have
babies, brother

308
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,280
Sister. Sorry.
What's the point?

309
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,600
What?
What's the point of fighting
for his right to have babies...

310
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,000
when he can't have babies?

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,560
It is symbolic of our
struggle against oppression.

312
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,200
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

313
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,600
It's dangerous out there.

314
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelot spleens.

315
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,880
Got any nuts?
Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.

316
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,360
I've got wrens' livers,
badger spleens
No, no, no.

317
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
Otters' noses?
I don't want that Roman rubbish!

318
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,280
Why don't you sell proper food?
Proper food?

319
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,080
Yeah, and not those rich,
lmperialist tidbits.

320
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,320
Well, don't blame me.
I didn't ask to sell this stuff.

321
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,480
All right.
Bag of otters' noses, then.

322
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Make it two. Thanks, Reg.
Two.

323
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Are you the Judean People's Front?
Fuck off!

324
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,280
What?
Judean People's Front!

325
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,640
We're the People's Front of Judea!

326
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,480
Judean People's Front!
Wankers.

327
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,840
Can I join your group?
No. Piss off.

328
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,720
I didn't want to sell
this stuff. It's only a job.

329
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,440
I hate the Romans as much as anybody!
Shhh. Shhh!

330
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,960
Are you sure?
Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.

331
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,480
Listen, if you wanted
to join the P.F.J.,

332
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,520
you'd have to really
hate the Romans.

333
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,560
I do.
Oh, yeah? How much?

334
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
A lot.

335
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,040
Right. You're in.

336
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Listen. The only people
we hate more than the Romans...

337
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,440
are the fuckin'
Judean People's Front.

338
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
Yeah!
Splitters!

339
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,120
And the Judean Popular People's Front.
Oh, yeah! Splitters!

340
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,880
And the People's Front of Judea.
Splitters!

341
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,400
What?
The People's Front of Judea.

342
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
We're the People's Front of Judea!

343
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,120
Oh. I thought we were
the Popular Front.

344
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
People's Front!

345
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,720
What happened to the Popular Front?
He's over there.

346
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,160
Splitter!

347
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh! I think I'm about
to have a cardiac arrest.

348
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,120
Absolutely dreadful.

349
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,320
Brother! Haha!
What's your name?

350
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,960
Brian. Brian Cohen.

351
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,320
We may have a little job
for you, Brian.

352
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,680
What's this, then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?

353
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,880
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

354
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,120
Ilt says "Romans, go home".

355
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,280
No, it doesn't.
What's Latin for "Roman"?

356
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,440
Come on!
"Romanes"?

357
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,480
Goes like?
"Annus"?

358
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,800
Vocative plural of "annus" is?
"Anni"?

359
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,640
"Romani".

360
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,320
"Eunt"? What is "eunt"?
"Go".

361
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
Conjugate the verb "to go".

362
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,960
"lre, eo, is, it,
imus, itis, eunt".

363
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
So "eunt" is?

364
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,800
Third person plural,
present indicative. "They go".

365
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,560
But "Romans, go home" is
an order, so you must use the

366
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
The imperative.
Which is?

367
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
Um, oh, oh, "i".

368
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,560
How many Romans?
Aah! Plural, plural.

369
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
"Ite".
"Ite".

370
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,800
"Domus"? Nominative?

371
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,960
"Go home". This is motion
towards, isn't it, Brian?

372
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,960
Dative!

373
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,080
No, not dative!

374
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Accusative, accusative!

375
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,120
"Domum", sir. "Ad domum".
Except when "domus" takes the

376
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,160
Locative, sir.
Which is?

377
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,400
"Domum".
"Domum".

378
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,680
"Um".

379
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,680
Understand?
Yes, sir.

380
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,040
Now, write it out 100 times.

381
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,600
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar, sir.

382
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,560
Hail Caesar. If it's not done
by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.

383
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,080
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

384
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,560
Finished!

385
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,080
Right. Now,
don't do it again.

386
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,120
Hey, bloody Romans!

387
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,200
We're gettin' in through the
underground heating system here,

388
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,080
up through into the main
audience chamber here,

389
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,320
and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

390
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,800
Having grabbed his wife, we inform
Pilate that she is in our custody...

391
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,200
and forthwith issue our demands.

392
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,240
Any questions?
What exactly are the demands?

393
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,400
We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle...

394
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,000
the entire apparatus of
the Roman lmperialist State,

395
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

396
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,400
Cut her head off?
Cut all her bits off.

397
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,480
Send them back
on the hour, every hour.

398
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,280
And, of course, we point out
that they bear...

399
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,800
full responsibility
when we chop her up...

400
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,040
and that we shall not submit
to blackmail.

401
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,360
No blackmail!

402
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,120
They bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

403
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,880
And not just from us. From our fathers
and from our fathers' fathers.

404
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,280
And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
Yeah.

405
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,000
And from our fathers'
fathers' fathers' fathers.
Don't labor the point.

406
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,640
And what have they ever
given us in return?

407
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
The aqueduct.
What?

408
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,480
The aqueduct.

409
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They did give us that.

410
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,200
And the sanitation.

411
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

412
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, I'll grant you,
the aqueduct and sanitation are
two things the Romans have done.

413
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,640
And the roads.
Well, obviously the roads.

414
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,240
I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

415
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,280
But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads

416
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
lrrigation.
Medicine.

417
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,720
Education.
Yeah, all right. Fair enough.

418
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,840
And the wine.

419
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,120
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss,
Reg, if the Romans left.

420
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,040
Public baths.
And it's safe to walk
in the streets at night.

421
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,920
Yeah, they certainly keep order.
They're the only ones who could
in a place like this.

422
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,000
All right, but apart from
the sanitation, the medicine,

423
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,240
education, wine, public order,
irrigation, roads,

424
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,880
the fresh water system
and public health,

425
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,280
what have the Romans
ever done for us?

426
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,280
Brought peace.
Oh, peace! Shut up!

427
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm a poor man.
My sight is poor.

428
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,400
My legs are old and bent.

429
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
It's all right, Matthias.

430
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,600
It's all clear.

431
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,880
Well, where's Reg?

432
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.

433
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,280
What went wrong?
The first blow has been struck.

434
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,520
Did he finish the slogan?
A hundred times,

435
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
in letters ten foot high,
all the way around the palace.

436
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,400
Oh, great. Great.

437
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,320
We We need doers
in our movement, Brian,

438
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,880
but before you join us, know this:

439
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,560
There is not one of us who
would not gladly suffer death...

440
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,040
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.

441
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,400
Oh, yeah, there's one.

442
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?

443
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,560
Yes.

444
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,400
From now on you shall be called
"Brian that is called Brian".

445
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

446
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,520
Right.
This is the plan.

447
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,200
Now, this is the palace
on Caesar's Square.

448
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,080
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street under cover of night...

449
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,680
and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

450
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

451
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,360
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the P.F.J.,

452
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,960
will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head,

453
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,280
though he himself will not be taking
part in any terrorist action...

454
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,280
as he has a bad back.

455
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,520
Aren't you going to come with us?
Solidarity, brother.

456
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,360
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.

457
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,560
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

458
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,840
There is a Roman feast later
in the evening, so you must move fast.

459
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,880
And don't wear
your best sandals.

460
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,680
Turning left here, we enter the
CaesarAugustus memorial sewer,

461
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,480
and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust.

462
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,400
This has just been retiled. So,
terrorists, careful with those weapons.

463
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,160
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.

464
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,520
This is the moment for Habbakuk
to get out his prong.

465
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,520
Shhh. Shhh.

466
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,320
Campaign for Free Galilee.

467
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,520
Oh, uh, People's Front
of Judea. Officials.

468
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,280
Oh.
What's your group doing here?

469
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,520
We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife,
take her back, issue demands.

470
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,520
So are we. That's our plan.
What?

471
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,120
We were here first.
What do you mean?

472
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,480
We thought of it first.
We did!

473
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,120
Yes, a couple of years ago.
We did!

474
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,520
Come on. You got all your demands
worked out, then?

475
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,800
Of course we have.
What are they?

476
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,320
Well, I'm not telling you.
Oh, come on!

477
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,160
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

478
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,200
Did not!
We did!

479
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,400
You bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

480
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,640
Well, tough pity for you,
Fish Face. Oh!

481
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Brothers, we should
be struggling together.

482
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,160
We mustn't fight each other.

483
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,680
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy.

484
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,240
The Judean People's Front!

485
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,720
No, no, the Romans!

486
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

487
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,920
Yeah, he's right.

488
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,520
Right. Where were we?
You were gonna punch me.

489
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,920
Brothers!

490
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,080
What

491
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,400
You lucky bastard.

492
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,440
Who's that?

493
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
You lucky, lucky bastard.

494
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,840
What?
Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?

495
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
What do you mean?
You must've slipped him a few shekels.

496
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face.

497
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,800
Oh, what wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face!

498
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,520
I sometimes hang awake at night
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

499
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,480
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They have me in manacles.

500
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,000
Manacles?

501
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,800
My idea of heaven is to be
allowed to be put in manacles...

502
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,960
just for a few hours.

503
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
They must think the sun shines
out of your ass, son.

504
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh, lay off me!
I've had a hard time!

505
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,640
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years.

506
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,960
They only hung me the right way
up yesterday, so don't you

507
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
All right, all right.

508
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,320
They must think
you're Lord God Almighty.

509
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,160
What will they do to me?
Oh, you'll probably
get away with crucifixion.

510
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,320
Crucifixion?
Yeah, first offense.

511
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,520
Get away with crucifixion?
It's

512
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
What?

513
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion,
this country'd be in a bloody mess.

514
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,880
Guard!
Nail him up, I say!

515
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,040
Guard!
Nail some sense into him!

516
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
What do you want?

517
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,440
I want you to move me to another cell.

518
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,920
Aah!
Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.

519
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,920
Shut up, you!
Sorry.

520
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,200
Now take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

521
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Every night, they take me down for
20 minutes, then they hang me up again,

522
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,360
which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

523
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,200
And if nothing else, it's
taught me to respect the Romans,

524
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,240
and it's taught me that you'll
never get anywhere in this life...

525
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,720
unless you're prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's

526
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Oh, shut up!

527
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Here.
Pilate wants to see you.

528
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Me?
Come on!

529
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,760
Pilate? What's he want
to see me for?

530
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,800
I think he wants to know which way up
you want to be crucified.

531
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,280
Nice one, centurion. Like it.

532
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,600
Shut up!
Right, right.

533
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Terrific race, the Romans.
Terrific!

534
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,040
Hail Caesar.
Hail.

535
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,840
Only one survivor, sir.
Oh. "Thwow" him to the floor.

536
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,080
What's that?
Throw him to the floor.

537
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Oh.

538
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,320
Now, what is
your name, Jew?

539
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,320
Brian, sir.
"Bwian", eh?

540
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
No, no. Brian.

541
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,560
Aah!

542
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,560
The little rascal
has "spiwit".

543
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,960
Has what, sir?
"Spiwit".

544
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,120
Yes, he did, sir.

545
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,560
No, no. "Spiwit", "bwavado",
a touch of "dewwingdo".

546
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,160
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.

547
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
So, you dare to "waid" us?

548
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,360
To what, sir?

549
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,880
"Stwike" him, centurion,
very "woughly".

550
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,320
Aah!
And "thwow" him to the floor, sir?

551
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
What?
"Thwow" him to the floor again, sir?

552
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, yes, "thwow" him
to the floor, please.

553
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,960
Aah!
Now, Jewish "wapscallion"

554
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm not Jewish.
I'm a Roman.

555
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,160
A "Woman"?
No, no. Roman.

556
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,160
Aah!

557
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,200
So, your father was
a "Woman". Who was he?

558
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,000
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

559
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,280
Really?
What was his name?

560
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,640
"Naughtius Maximus".

561
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,240
Centurion, do you have
anyone of that name in the garrison?

562
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,480
Well, no, sir.

563
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,720
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

564
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,560
Well, no, sir.
I think it's a joke, sir.

565
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,760
Like, uh, "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus", sir.

566
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,880
What's funny
about "Biggus Dickus"?

567
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,280
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

568
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,760
I have a very great
friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.

569
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,560
Silence!
What is all this insolence?

570
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,080
You will find yourself
in gladiator school "vewy" quickly...

571
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,080
with "wotten" behavior like that.

572
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,560
Can I go now, sir?
Aaah!

573
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,080
Wait till Biggus Dickus
hears of this.

574
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,480
"Wight"! Take him away!

575
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,080
Oh, sir, he
I want him fighting wild,
"wabid" animals within a week.

576
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,040
Yes, sir.
Come on, you.

577
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,920
I will not have my friends
"widiculed" by the common "soldiewy".

578
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Anyone else feel like
a little giggle...

579
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,000
when I mention my "fwiend",

580
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,320
Biggus...

581
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,480
Dickus?

582
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,120
What about you?
Do you find it "wisible"...

583
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,880
when I say the name...

584
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,600
Biggus... Dickus?

585
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,040
He has a wife, you know?

586
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,760
You know what she's called?

587
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,640
She's called "lncontinentia".

588
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,560
"lncontinentia Buttocks".

589
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,920
Shut up!
What is all this?

590
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
I've had enough of this
"wowdy", "webel" behavior!

591
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,120
Silence! Quiet!
"Pwaetowian" guards!

592
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,000
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

593
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,560
Hmm? Hmm.

594
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,640
Oh, you lucky bastard.

595
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,480
And the bezan
shall be huge and black...

596
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,120
And the eyes thereof red with
the blood of living creatures!

597
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,040
And the whore of Babylon...

598
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,320
shall ride forth
on a threeheaded serpent!

599
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,280
And throughout the lands
there'll be a great rubbing of parts.

600
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,800
The demon shall bear
a ninebladed sword.

601
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,400
Ninebladed not two
or five or seven, but nine

602
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,200
which he will wield on all wretched
sinners, just like you, sir, there.

603
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,440
And the whoring shall be
on the head of Addius.

604
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,960
There shall in that time
be rumors of things going astray,

605
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,520
um, and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

606
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
And nobody will really know
where lieth...

607
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,240
those little things...

608
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,520
with the sort of raffia work
base that has an attachment.

609
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,320
At this time, a friend
shall lose his friend's hammer,

610
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,200
and the young shall not know
where lieth...

611
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,560
the things possessed
by their fathers...

612
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,320
that their fathers put there
only just the night before about 8:00.

613
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,200
Yea, it is written
in the Book of Cyril...

614
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,720
in that time

615
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,760
How much, quick?
It's for the wife.

616
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Oh, uh, 20 shekels.
Right.

617
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,000
What?
There you are.

618
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,000
Wait a minute.
What?

619
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,400
We're supposed to haggle.
No, no, no. I've got to get

620
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,400
What do you mean, no?
I haven't got time.

621
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,960
Well, give it back, then.
No, no. I just paid you.

622
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,440
Burt, this bloke won't haggle.
Won't haggle?

623
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,600
All right.
Do we have to?

624
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,360
I want 20 for that.
I just gave you 20.

625
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,160
Are you telling me
that's not worth 20 shekels?
No.

626
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,680
Feel the quality.
That's none of your goat.
I'll give you 19, then.

627
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
No, no, no. Do it properly.
What?

628
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,200
Haggle properly. This isn't worth 19.
You just said it was worth 20.

629
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,040
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Come on, haggle.

630
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,600
All right, I'll give you ten.
That's more like it.

631
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,800
Ten? Are you
trying to insult me?

632
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,680
Me with a poor, dying
grandmother? Ten?

633
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,600
All right, I'll give you 11.
Now you're gettin' it.

634
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,040
Did I hear you right? Eleven?
This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?

635
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,800
Seventeen?
No, no, no, no. Seventeen.

636
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,400
Eighteen.
No, no. You go to 14 now.

637
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,320
All right, I'll give you 14.
Fourteen? Are you joking?

638
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,680
That's what you told me to say!
Oh, dear.

639
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,080
Oh, tell me
what to say, please!

640
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Offer me 14.
I'll give you 14.

641
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,240
He's offering me 14 for this!
Fifteen!

642
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,680
Seventeen. My last word. I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

643
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,600
Sixteen.
Done.

644
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,720
Nice to do business with you.

645
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,760
I'll throw you in this as well.
I don't want it, but thanks.

646
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,080
Burt.
All right, all right.

647
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,880
Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
I just gave you 20.

648
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,720
Right. That's four I owe you, then.
That's right. That's fine.

649
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,200
I've got it here somewhere.
That's four for the gourd.

650
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,880
Four? For this gourd?

651
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,800
Look at it! It's worth ten
if it's worth a shekel.

652
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,120
You gave it to me for nothing.
Yes, but it's worth ten.

653
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,000
All right, all right.

654
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,920
No, no, no, no.
It's not worth ten.

655
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,640
You're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad".

656
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,800
Oh, well.
One born every minute.

657
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,840
Daniel.
Daniel.

658
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,080
Job.
Job.

659
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
Joshua.
Joshua.

660
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,640
Judges.
Judges.

661
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,400
And Brian.
And Brian.

662
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,840
I now propose that all seven
of these exbrothers...

663
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,320
be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

664
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,880
I second that, Reg.
Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

665
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,120
Siblings, let us not
be down on it.

666
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,600
One total catastrophe like this...

667
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,480
is just the beginning!

668
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,480
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in

669
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,480
Look out!

670
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,360
Hello?

671
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,520
Matthias?

672
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,880
Reg?
Go away.

673
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,560
Reg, it's me, Brian.

674
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,720
Get off!
Get off out of it!

675
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,760
Stan!
Piss off.

676
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,680
Yeah, piss off.
Bugger off.

677
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,840
Oh, shit!

678
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
Coming.

679
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,240
Yea, verily at that time it is
written in the book of Obadiah,

680
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,240
a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey.

681
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,440
My eyes are dim.
I cannot see.

682
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,960
Are you Matthias?
Yes.

683
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,000
We have reason to believe
you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth,

684
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,240
a member of the terrorist organization,
the People's Front of Judea.

685
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,040
Me? No.
I'm just a poor old man.

686
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,120
I have no time
for lawbreakers.

687
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,560
My legs are grey.
My ears are nulled.

688
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
My eyes are old and bent.

689
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,760
Quiet!
Silly person.

690
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,920
Guards, search the house.

691
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,960
You know the penalty
laid down by Roman law...

692
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
for harboring
a known criminal?

693
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,040
No.
Crucifixion.

694
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,400
Oh.

695
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,120
Nasty, eh?
Could be worse.

696
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,600
What do you mean,
"Could be worse"?

697
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,920
Well, you could be stabbed.

698
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,400
Stabbed? Takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours.

699
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,080
It's a slow, horrible death.

700
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,320
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

701
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,560
You're weird.

702
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,160
No, sir.
Couldn't find anything, sir.

703
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,440
Well, don't worry.
You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.

704
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,000
Big Nose.
Watch it!

705
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,440
Whew, that was lucky.

706
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,560
I'm sorry, Reg.

707
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,880
Oh, it's all right.
He's sorry.

708
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,640
He's sorry he led the Fifth Legion
straight to our headquarters.

709
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,600
Well, that's all right,
then, Brian. Sit down.

710
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,200
Have a scone.
Make yourself at home. You klutz!

711
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,760
You stupid, birdbrained,
flatheaded

712
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,520
My legs are old and bent.

713
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,520
My ears are grizzled. Yes?

714
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,800
There's one place
we didn't look. Guards!

715
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,960
I'm just a poor old man.

716
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,960
My nose is knackered.

717
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,480
Have you ever seen
anyone crucified?

718
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,880
Crucifixion's a doddle.

719
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,880
Don't keep saying that.

720
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,960
Found this spoon, sir.

721
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,240
Well done, sergeant.

722
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,840
We'll be back, oddball.

723
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,400
Open up!

724
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,040
You haven't given us
time to hide.

725
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,920
ln that time
The serpent, he shall strike you

726
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,480
Holes from every bitch
you got germs from
Jumbo jets

727
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,400
Don't pass judgement
on other people...

728
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,560
or you might
get judged yourself.

729
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,280
What?
I said, don't pass
judgement on other people...

730
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,080
or else you might
get judged too.

731
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,040
Who, me?
Yes.

732
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,280
Thank you very much.
Not just you. All of you.

733
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,680
That's a nice gourd.
What?

734
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,240
How much do you want for the gourd?
You can have it.

735
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,080
Have it?
Yes. Consider the lilies.

736
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,360
Don't you want to haggle?
No. In the field.

737
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,680
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. Take it.

738
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,880
Consider the lilies?
Well, the birds, then.

739
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,880
What birds?
Any birds.

740
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,520
Why?
Well, have they got jobs?

741
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,480
Who?
The birds.

742
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,480
Have the birds got jobs?

743
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,120
What's the matter with him?
Says the birds are scrounging.

744
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,120
The point is, the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

745
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,000
Well, good luck to 'em.
Yeah, they're very pretty.

746
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,040
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

747
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,880
So what are you worrying about?
There you are. See?

748
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,600
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

749
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,760
I haven't got anything
against the birds.

750
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Consider the lilies.
He's having a go at the flowers now!

751
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,840
Give the flowers a chance.
I'll give you one for it.

752
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,080
It's yours.
Two, then.

753
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,480
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants.

754
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,280
What were they called?
What were their names?

755
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,840
I don't know.
And he gave them some talents.

756
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,600
You don't know?
Well, it doesn't matter.

757
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,720
He doesn't know
what they were called!

758
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,080
They were called Simon and Adrian.
You said you didn't know!

759
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,200
It really doesn't matter. The point is,
there were these two servants.

760
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,240
He's making it up as he goes along.
No, I'm not!

761
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,600
And he gave them
Wait, were there three?

762
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,000
Oh, he's terrible.

763
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,560
There were two or three.
Oh, get off!

764
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,160
Now hear this!
Blessed are they...

765
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,560
Three.
who convert their neighbor's asses.

766
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,400
For they shall inhibit their girth.
Rubbish!

767
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,680
And to them only shall be given

768
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,960
to them only...

769
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,880
shall be given

770
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
What?
Hmm?

771
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,320
Shall be given what?
Oh, nothing.

772
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,840
What were you going to say?
Nothing.

773
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,200
Yes, you were going to say something.
No, I finished.

774
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,400
Tell us before you go.
I'm finished.

775
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,760
No, you don't.
Why won't he tell?

776
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,520
Won't say!
It ain't a secret, is it?

777
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,400
Must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
Tell us.

778
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,480
Leave me alone.
What is the secret?

779
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,960
ls it the secret of eternal life?
He won't say.

780
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,760
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

781
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,400
Leave me alone!
Just tell me, please.

782
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,360
We were here first.

783
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,960
Go away!
Tell us, master.

784
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,040
ls that his gourd?
Yeah, but it's under offer.

785
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,200
This is his gourd.

786
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,480
Ten!
It is his gourd!

787
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,560
We will carry it
for you, master.

788
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,080
Master?
He's gone!

789
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,600
He's been taken up.

790
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,720
He's been taken up!

791
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,640
Nineteen!
No, there he is. Over there.

792
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,200
Look! Oh! Oh!

793
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,200
He has given us a sign.

794
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,680
He has given us his shoe!

795
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,560
The shoe is the sign.
Let us follow his example.

796
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,800
What?
Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!

797
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,120
For this is his sign that all
who follow him shall do likewise!

798
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,680
Yes!
No, no. The shoe is a sign...

799
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,960
that we must gather shoes
together in abundance.

800
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,560
Cast off the shoes.
Follow the gourd!

801
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,680
No, let us gather shoes
together! Let me!

802
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,040
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must
think not of the things of the body...

803
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,040
but of the face and head.

804
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,720
Give me your shoe!
Get off!

805
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,240
Follow the gourd,
the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!

806
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,000
The gourd!
Hold up the sandal,
as he has commanded us.

807
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,680
It is a shoe!
It's a sandal!

808
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,200
No, it isn't!
Cast it away!

809
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,240
Put it on!
Clear off!

810
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,880
Take the shoes
and follow him!

811
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,520
Come back! Stop!

812
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,080
Let us Let us pray.

813
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,120
Yea, he cometh to us...

814
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,480
Iike the seeds of the grain.

815
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,560
Master! Master!

816
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,480
Hey! ls there
another way down?

817
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,200
Is there another path
down to the river?

818
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,600
Please, please help me.
I've got to get

819
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,280
Oh, my foot! Oh

820
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,640
Shhh.
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

821
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,280
I'm sorry.
Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!

822
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,600
I'm sorry. Shhh.
Don't you "shhh" me.

823
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,760
Eighteen years of total silence,
and you "shhh" me!

824
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,960
What?
I've kept my vow for 18 years...

825
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,040
Not a single, recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

826
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,680
Could you be quiet
for another five minutes?

827
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,400
It doesn't matter now.
I might as well enjoy myself.

828
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,240
For the last 18 years,
I've wanted to shout...

829
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,040
and sing and scream
my name out!

830
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,200
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, I'm alive!

831
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,360
" Hava nagila, hava nagila "

832
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,280
" Hava nagila "

833
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds. Hello, trees.

834
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,840
I'm alive! I'm alive!

835
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,840
" Hava nagila
Hava n'ra, n'ra "

836
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,400
Master! Master! Master!

837
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,960
Master!
The master! He is here!

838
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,400
His shoe led us to him!

839
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,160
Speak! Speak to us, master.
Speak to us!

840
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,920
Go away!

841
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,600
A blessing! A blessing!

842
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,160
How shall we go away, master?

843
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,640
Oh, just go away
and leave me alone!

844
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,880
Give us a sign!

845
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,240
He has given us a sign!
He has brought us to this place!

846
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,160
I didn't bring you here.
You just followed me.

847
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,320
Oh, it's still a good sign
by any standard.

848
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,320
Master, your people
have walked many miles to be with you!

849
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,360
They are weary
and have not eaten.

850
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,560
It's not my fault
they haven't eaten.

851
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,120
There is no food
in this high mountain!

852
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,400
What about the juniper
bushes over there?

853
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,160
A miracle! A miracle!

854
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,600
He has made the bush
fruitful by his words!

855
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,080
They've brought forth
juniper berries.

856
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,840
Of course! They're juniper bushes!
What do you expect!

857
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,000
Show us another miracle.

858
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,160
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!

859
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,960
Is not the miracle of
the juniper bushes enough?

860
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,120
I say, those
are my juniper bushes!

861
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,880
They are a gift from God.
They're all I've got to eat.

862
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,160
I say, get off those bushes.
Go on. Clear off.

863
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,480
Lord, I am affected
by a bald patch.

864
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,920
I'm healed!
The master has healed me!

865
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,920
I didn't touch him!

866
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,760
I was blind,
and now I can see!

867
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,960
A miracle! A miracle!

868
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,120
Tell them to stop it.

869
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,680
I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

870
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,520
A miracle!
He is the Messiah!

871
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,360
He hurt my foot!

872
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,720
Hurt my foot!
Hurt mine!

873
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,560
Hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah.

874
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,200
I say you are, Lord, and I should know.
I've followed a few.

875
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,560
Hail Messiah!

876
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,480
I'm not the Messiah!
Will you please listen?

877
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,880
I'm not the Messiah!
Do you understand? Honestly!

878
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:42,280
Only the true Messiah
denies his divinity.

879
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,720
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

880
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,000
All right,
I am the Messiah!

881
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,800
He is!
He is the Messiah!

882
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,240
Now, fuck off!

883
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,000
How shall we
fuck off, O Lord?

884
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,920
Just leave me alone!

885
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,120
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries!

886
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,240
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

887
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,360
and then you try to clean up
on my juniper bushes!

888
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,800
Lay off!
This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!

889
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,960
No, he's not.
An unbeliever!

890
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,160
An unbeliever!
Persecute. Kill the heretic!

891
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,200
Seize him!
Leave him alone!

892
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,560
Leave him alone!

893
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,880
Leave him alone.

894
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,960
Let him go! Please!

895
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,840
Brian?
Judith?

896
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,520
Cockadoodledoo!

897
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,320
Look! There he is!
The Chosen One has woken!

898
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,280
Brian!

899
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,800
Brian!
Hang on, Mother!

900
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,920
Shhh.

901
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,000
Hello, Mother.
Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!

902
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,280
What are all those people
doing out there?

903
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,320
Well, I
Come on. What have you been up to?

904
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,840
I think they must have
popped by for something.

905
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,720
Popped by?
Swarmed by, more like.

906
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,880
There's a multitude out there!

907
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,080
They started following me yesterday.

908
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,280
Well, they can stop
following you right now.

909
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,240
Now, stop following my son!

910
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,240
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

911
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:23,600
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

912
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,560
The who?
The Messiah!

913
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,240
There's no messiah in here.

914
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,560
There's a mess, all right,
but no messiah. Now, go away.

915
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,160
Brian! Brian!

916
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,360
Right, my lad.
What have you been up to?

917
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,400
Nothing, Mum.
Come on, out with it.

918
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,400
Well, they think
I'm the Messiah, Mum.

919
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,840
What have you
been telling them?

920
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,240
Nothing. I only
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

921
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,840
I can explain.
Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!

922
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,560
Your son is a born leader.

923
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,320
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

924
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,320
They believe he can give them hope
hope of a new life,

925
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,840
a new world,
a better future!

926
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,320
Who's that?

927
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,440
That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.

928
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,400
Hmm. Aaah!

929
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,240
Ohhh!
Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!

930
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,320
Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

931
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,600
Now, you listen here.
He's not the Messiah!

932
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,960
He's a very naughty boy.
Now, go away!

933
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,080
Who are you?
I'm his mother, that's who.

934
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,640
Behold his mother!
Behold his mother!

935
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,120
Hail to thee,
mother of Brian!

936
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,720
Blessed art thou!
Hosanna!

937
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,440
All praise to thee,
now and always!

938
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,720
Well, now don't think
you can get around me like that.

939
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,240
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

940
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,440
Now, shove off!
No!

941
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,920
Did you hear what I said?
Yes!

942
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,920
Oh, I see.
It's like that, is it?

943
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,400
Yes!
Oh, all right, then.

944
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,200
You can see him for one minute,
but not one second more!

945
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,760
Do you understand?
Yes.

946
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,000
Promise?
Well... all right.

947
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,760
All right, here he is, then.
Come on, Brian. Come and talk.

948
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,240
But, Mum, Judith.
Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.

949
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,280
I don't really want to.

950
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,400
Brian! Brian!
Brian! Brian!

951
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,680
Good morning.
A blessing! A blessing!

952
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,280
No, no. Please.
Please, please listen.

953
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,680
I've got one or two
things to say.

954
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,320
Tell us!
Tell us both of them!

955
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,160
Look, you've
got it all wrong.

956
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,840
You don't need to follow me.

957
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,200
You don't need
to follow anybody.

958
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,600
You've got to think
for yourselves.

959
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,440
You're all individuals.

960
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,760
Yes, we're all individuals!

961
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
You're all different.

962
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,120
Yes, we're all different!

963
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,840
I'm not.
Shhh.

964
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,560
You've all got to work it
out for yourselves.

965
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,800
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

966
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,840
Exactly.

967
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,160
Tell us more!

968
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,760
No! That's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

969
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,880
Otherwise Ow!

970
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,000
That's enough.
That's enough.

971
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,560
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!

972
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,440
Oh, yes it was!
Oh, no it wasn't!

973
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,440
Now, stop that!
And go away!

974
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,720
Excuse me?
Yes?

975
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,120
Are you a virgin?
I beg your pardon!

976
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,560
Well, if it's not a personal
question, are you a virgin?

977
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,360
If it's not
a personal question?

978
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,920
How much more personal
can you get?

979
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,280
Now, piss off!

980
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,720
She is.
Yeah, definitely.

981
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,040
Morning, Savior.

982
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,000
Lay your hands
on me, quick!

983
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,360
Now, don't jostle
the Chosen One, please.

984
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,440
Don't push that baby
in the Savior's face.

985
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,120
I say, could you just
see my wife?

986
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,240
You'll have to wait,
I'm afraid.

987
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,800
We've got
a luncheon appointment.

988
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,840
The lepers are queuing.

989
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,800
My brotheronlaw
is the exmayor of Gath!

990
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,000
Brian, can I introduce
the gentleman who's letting us
have the Mounts on Sunday?

991
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,240
Don't push!
And keep the noise down!

992
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,440
Those possessed by devils,
try and keep them under control.

993
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,320
Incurables, you'll just
have to wait for a few minutes.

994
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:14,000
Um, women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

995
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,880
Brian? Brian,
you were fantastic.

996
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,080
You weren't so bad yourself.

997
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,120
No. What you said just now.
It was quite extraordinary.

998
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,160
What?
All that, was it?

999
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,320
We don't any leaders.
You're so right.

1000
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,160
Reg has been dominating us
for too long.
Well, yes.

1001
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,040
It needed saying,
and you said it, Brian.
You're very attractive.

1002
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,400
It's our revolution.
We can all do it together.

1003
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,320
I think. I think
We're all behind you, Brian.

1004
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,480
The revolution is in your hands!
What?

1005
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,840
No, that's not
what I meant at all!

1006
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,200
You're fuckin' nicked,
me old beauty.

1007
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,200
Right.

1008
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,320
Stop it.

1009
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,880
Well, "Bwian", you've given us
a good "wun" for our money, what?

1010
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,760
But this time, I "guawantee"
you will not escape.

1011
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,800
Guard, do we have any
"cwucifixions" today?

1012
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,480
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

1013
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,840
Right. Now we have 140.
Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?

1014
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,720
Hail Caesar!

1015
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,760
Hail.
The crowd outside getting restless.

1016
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,880
Permission
to disperse them, please.

1017
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,440
Disperse them?
I haven't addressed them yet.

1018
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,080
I know, sir, but

1019
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,600
My "addwess" is one of
the high points of the Passover.

1020
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,880
My "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has
come all the way from "Wome".

1021
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,400
Hail Caesar.
Hail "Thaesar",

1022
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,280
You're not

1023
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,040
Are you not thinking of giving it
a miss this year, then, sir?

1024
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,200
Give it a miss?

1025
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,680
Well, it's just that they're in
a rather funny mood today, sir.

1026
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,760
"Weally", "centuwion", I'm "surpwised"
to hear a man like you...

1027
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,280
"wattled" by
a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels".

1028
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,440
Uh, a bit thundery, sir.
Take him away.

1029
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,320
I'm a Roman!
Il can prove it! Honestly!

1030
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,760
And "cwucify" him well.
Yes.

1031
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,360
Biggus.

1032
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,160
Il really wouldn't, sir.
Out of the way, "centuwion".

1033
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,520
Let me come with you,
Pontius.

1034
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,720
I may be of "thome" "athistance"
if there is a "thudden" "crithis".

1035
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,160
Right. Now item four:
Attainment of world supremacy
within the next five years.

1036
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,400
Uh, Francis, you've been
doing some work on this?
Yeah. Thank you, Reg.

1037
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,960
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

1038
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,960
unless we can smash the Roman Empire
within the next 12 months.

1039
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,960
Twelve months, yeah?
Twelve months.

1040
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,520
And let's face it, as empires
go, this is the big one,

1041
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,880
so we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talkin' about it.

1042
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,840
Hear! Hear!
It's action that counts, not words.

1043
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,280
And we need action now!
Hear! Hear!

1044
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,360
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

1045
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,880
talkin', passin' resolutions,
makin' clever speeches.

1046
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,320
It's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

1047
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,760
So let's just stop gabbin' on about it.
It's completely pointless.

1048
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
And it's gettin' us nowhere.
Right!

1049
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,320
I agree. This is a complete
waste of time.

1050
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,200
They've arrested Brian!
What? What?

1051
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,960
They dragged him off!
They want to crucify him!

1052
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,560
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

1053
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,160
What?
lmmediate!

1054
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,680
Right.
New motion?

1055
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,120
Completely new motion.
Uh, that, uh,

1056
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,840
that there be
immediate action

1057
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,560
Once the vote has been taken.
Obviously once the vote's been taken.

1058
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,800
You can't act on a resolution
till you've voted on it.
Reg, let's go now, please!

1059
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,880
Right! ln the light of fresh
information from Sibling Judith.
Not so fast, Reg.

1060
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,840
Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple.

1061
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,920
All you've got to do
is to go out of that door now...

1062
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,560
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1063
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,520
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!

1064
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,160
Can't you understand?

1065
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,200
Oh!

1066
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,920
Ooh. Ooh. Yup.

1067
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,360
A little ego trip
from the feminists?

1068
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,920
What?
Oh, sorry, Loretta?

1069
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,040
Uh, read that back,
would you?

1070
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,760
Next? Crucifixion?

1071
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,760
Yes.
Good.

1072
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,400
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1073
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,560
Next? Crucifixion?

1074
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,560
Yes.
Good.

1075
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,160
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1076
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,720
Next? Crucifixion?

1077
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,360
Uh, no, freedom.
Mmm? What?

1078
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,880
Uh, freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything,

1079
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,800
so I could go free
and live on an island somewhere.

1080
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,120
Oh. Well, that's jolly good.
Well, off you go then.

1081
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,800
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1082
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,360
Oh, I see.
Very good, very good.

1083
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,720
Well, out of the door
Yeah, I know the way. Out the door,

1084
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,720
one cross each,
line on the left.

1085
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,720
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.

1086
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
Crucifixion? Good.
Yes.

1087
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:27,400
People of "Jewusalem",

1088
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,600
"Wome" is your "fwiend".

1089
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,640
To "pwove" our "fwiendship",
it is "customawy" at this time...

1090
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,960
to "welease" a "wandewer"
"fwom" our "pwisons".

1091
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,120
Whom would you
have me "welease"?

1092
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,280
"Welease" "Woger"!

1093
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,960
"Welease" "Woger"!
"Welease" "Woger"!

1094
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,800
"Vewy" well,
I shall "welease" "Woger"!

1095
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,200
Sir, uh, we don't
have a Roger, sir.

1096
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,720
What?
Uh, we don't have anyone
of that name, sir.

1097
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,120
Ah. We have no "Woger".

1098
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,840
Well, what about
"Wodewick", then?

1099
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,360
Yeah! Release "Wodewick"!
Release "Wodewick"!

1100
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:33,280
"Centuwion",
why do they titter so?

1101
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,160
Just some,
uh, Jewish joke, sir.

1102
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,680
Are they... "wagging" me?

1103
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,800
Oh, no, sir.

1104
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,280
"Vewy" well.
I shall "welease" "Wodewick"!

1105
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,320
Sir, we don't have a Roderick, either.

1106
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,680
No "Woger", no "Wodewick".
Sorry, sir.

1107
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,640
Who is this "Wog" Who is
this "Wodewick" to whom you "wefer"?

1108
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,560
He's a "wobber"!

1109
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,520
And a "wapist"!

1110
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,720
And a pickpocket!

1111
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,760
Yeah Shh! Shh!
Shut up!

1112
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,840
He sounds a "notowious" "cwiminal".
We haven't got him, sir.

1113
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,640
Do we have anyone
in our "pwisons" at all?

1114
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,640
Oh, yes, sir. We got a Samson, sir.
Samson?

1115
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,000
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Uh, Silus the Assyrian Assassin.

1116
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,120
Uh, several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1117
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,880
Uh, 67
Let me "thpeak" to them.

1118
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,240
Oh, no
Yes, good idea, Biggus.

1119
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,960
Citizens, we have
Samson the Sadducee Strangler,

1120
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,720
Silus the Assyrian Assassin

1121
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,360
Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1122
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,440
Next.

1123
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,920
Crucifixion?
Yes.

1124
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,760
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1125
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,200
Jailer
Excuse me. There's been
some sort of mistake.

1126
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,920
Just a moment, would you?
Jailer, how many have come through?

1127
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,120
What?

1128
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,240
Uh, how many
have come through?

1129
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,720

ninetysix, sir.

1138
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,600
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1139
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,640
NNNNo, sir.

1140
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:48,320
NNot with these bbastards, sir.

CCrucifixion's
too good 'em, sir.

1144
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,160
I don't think you can say it's
too good for them. It's very nasty.

1145
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:03,800
Oh, it's not as nnnana

1146
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,160
not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1147
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,160
Yeah. Now, crucifixion?
ls there someone I can speak to?

1148
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,720
Well
I know where to get it, if you want it.

1149
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,320

Well, how did he get the job?

1152
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,120
BBloody Pilate's pet, sir.

1153
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,520
Get a move on, Big Nose. There's people
waitin' to be crucified out here.

1154
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,760
Could I see a lawyer or someone?

1155
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,680
Um, do, do you have a lawyer?
No, but I'm a Roman.

1156
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,680
How about a retrial?
We got plenty of time.

1157
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,800
Shut up, you!
Miserable Romans. No sense of humor.

1158
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,200
I'm sorry. Bit of a hurry.

1159
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,640
Can you go straight out?
Line on the left, one cross each. Now

1160
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,840
Was it something I said?

1161
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,000
Silence!

1162
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,240
This man commands
a "cwack" legion!

1163
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,360
He "wanks" as high
as any in "Wome".

1164
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,920
Crucifixion party.

1165
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,640
Morning. Now, we will be on
a show as we go through the town,

1166
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,680
so let's not
let the side down.

1167
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,800
Keep in a straight line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1168
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,160
and a good, steady pace.

1169
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,440
Crosses over
your left shoulders,

1170
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,120
and if you keep your backs
hard up against the cross beam,

1171
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,080
you'll be there in no time.

1172
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,120
All right, centurion.

1173
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,440
Crucifixion party
Wait for it!

1174
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,440
Crucifixion party,
by the left, forward!

1175
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,080
You lucky bastards!

1176
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,240
You lucky, jammy bastards!

1177
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,200
Let me shoulder
your burden, brother.

1178
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,200
Oh, thank you.

1179
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,960
HHey! Hey!
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1180
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,960
Uh, it's not my cross.
Shut up and get on with it!

1181
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,440
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson.

1182
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,320
All right.

1183
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,640
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1184
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,800
This time I want to hear
no "Weubens",

1185
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,080
no "Weginalds",

1186
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,560
no "Wudolph
the Wednosed Weindeers".

1187
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,600
No Spencer Tracys!
Or we shall release no one!

1188
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,960
Release Brian!
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

1189
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:05,880
"Welease" "Bwian"!
"Welease" "Bwian"!

1190
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,720
"Vewy" well. That's it.

1191
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,440
Sir, we, uh, we have got a Brian, sir.
What?

1192
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,600
Uh, you just sent him
for crucifixion, sir.

1193
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,680
Wait, wait.
We do have a "Bwian".

1194
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,000
Well, go and "wepwieve" him,
"stwaight" away.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1195
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,600
"Vewy" well.

1196
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,320
I shall... "welease" "Bwian"!

1197
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,680
Get a move on, there!
Or what?

1198
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,400
Or you'll be in trouble.
Oh, dear.

1199
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,600
You mean I might have to give up
being crucified in the afternoons?

1200
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,200
Shut up!
That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

1201
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,680
I wouldn't have nothing to do.
Oh, thank you.

1202
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,880
Are they gone?

1203
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,160
WWe've got lumps of it
round the back.

1204
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,160
What?
Oh, don't worry about him, sir.

1205
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,000
He's ma
He's m He's ma

1206
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,040
He's mm
He's mm

1207
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,080
He's mad, sir.
Are they gone?

1208
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,360
Oh, ye N

1209
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,200
I n Uh, I n NNNN

1210
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,280
NNNN
Oh, come on!

1211
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,760
Yes, sir.

1212
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,600
Anyway, get on with the story.
Well, I knew she never
really liked him, so I just

1213
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,240
Right.

1214
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,560
That's the motion to get on with it,
passed with one abstention.

1215
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,240
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a seconder for

1216
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,400
Let's just go.
Yeah.

1217
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
Oh, no!

1218
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,640
Bloody Romans!
Watch it!

1219
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,720
There's still
a few crosses left.

1220
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,880
Up you go, Big Nose.

1221
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,920
I'll get you for this, you bastard.
Oh, yeah?

1222
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,280
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I never forget a face.
No?

1223
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:10,640
I warn you, I'm gonna punch you
so hard, you Roman git!

1224
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,000
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

1225
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,160
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish!

1226
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,400
I'm a Samaritan!
A Samaritan?

1227
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,280
This is supposed
to be a Jewish section.

1228
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,280
It doesn't matter.
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1229
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,800
It may not matter to you, Roman,
but it certainly matters to us,
doesn't it, darling?

1230
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,520
Oh, rather!
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy,

1231
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,560
we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1232
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,200
Pharisees separate
from Sadducees.

1233
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,400
And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1234
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,440
All right, all right, all right.
We'll soon settle this.

1235
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,960
Hands up all those who don't
want to be crucified here.

1236
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,120
Right. Next!

1237
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,160
Uh, look. It's not my cross.
What?

1238
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,960
Um, it's not my cross.
I was, um, holding it for someone.

1239
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,000
Just lie down.
I haven't got all day.

1240
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,440
No, of course. Look.
I hate to make a fuss

1241
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,800
Look. We've had a busy day.
There's 140 of you lot to get up.

1242
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,440
ls he Jewish?
Will you be quiet?

1243
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,760
We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

1244
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,120
Belt up!
Will you let me down if he comes back?

1245
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,800
Yeah, yeah,
we'll let you down. Next!

1246
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,680
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to take orders.

1247
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,040
I like orders.

1248
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,400
See? Not so bad,
once you're up.

1249
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,400
You being rescued, then,
are you?

1250
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,400
It's a bit late for that now,
isn't it?

1251
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,840
Oh, now, now. We've got
a couple of days up here.

1252
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,920
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1253
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,440
Oh?
Yeah. My brother usually rescues me,

1254
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,080
if he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1255
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,120
Oh?
Randy little bugger.

1256
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,520
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

1257
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,080
Hello.
Your family arrived, then?

1258
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,880
Reg!

1259
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,400
Hello, Sibling Brian.
Thank God you've come, Reg.

1260
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:23,040
Well, I think I should point out
first, Brian, in all fairness,
we are not the rescue committee.

1261
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,960
However, I have been asked to read
the following prepared statement...

1262
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,000
on behalf of the movement.

1263
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,720
"We the People's Front of Judea

fraternal and sisterly greetings...

1265
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,840

the occasion of your martyrdom".

1266
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,760
What?
"Your death will stand as a landmark...

1267
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,800
"in the continuing struggle
to liberate the parent land...

imperialist aggressors,

of the P.F.J., etc".

1273
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,360
And I'd just like to add,
on a personal note, my own admiration...

1274
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,360
for what you're doing
for us, Brian,

1275
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,640
and what must be, after all,
for you a very difficult time.

1276
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,800
Reg, wwhat are you going to
Goodbye, Brian, and thanks.

1277
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,080
Well done, Brian.
Keep it up, lad.

1278
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,720
Terrific work, Brian.

1279
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,280
Right. And

" And so say all of "

1286
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,440
You bastards!
You sanctimonious bastards!
Where is Brian of Nazareth?

1287
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,920
I have an order for his release.
You stupid bastards!

1288
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,320
Uh, I'm Brian of Nazareth.

1289
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,360
Yeah, Ill'm Brian of Nazareth.

Take him away
and release him.

1295
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:18,160
No, I'm only joking. I'm not
really Brian. No, I'm not Brian.

1296
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,480
I was only It was a joke.
I'm only pulling your leg.

1297
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:26,280
It's a joke! I'm not him!
I'm just having you on! Put me back!

1298
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,840
Bloody Romans.
Can't take a joke.

1299

The Judean People's Front!

01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:12,040
Suicide Squad, attack!

1306
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,080
That showed them.

1307
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:29,560
You silly sods.

1308
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,400
Brian! Brian! Brian!

1309
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:37,760
Judith!
Terrific! Great!

1310
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,440
Reg has explained it all to me.
I think it's great, what you're doing.

1311
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,480
Thank you, Brian.

1312
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,240
I'll, I'll never forget you.

1313
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,200
So there you are!

1314
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,720
I might have known
it would end up like this.

1315
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,760
To think of all the love and
affection I've wasted on you.

1316
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,920
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor old mother...

1317
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,120
in the autumn years
of her life,

1318
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,640
all I can say is,
go ahead, be crucified!

1319
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,240
See if I care.
I might have known

1320
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,560
Mum!

1321
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:21,960
Mum!
I don't know
what the world's coming to.

1322
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,160
Cheer up, Brian.
You know what they say.

1323
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,280
Some things in life are bad.

1324
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,800
They can really make you mad.

1325
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,880
Other things just
make you swear and curse.

1326
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,720
" When you're chewing
on life's gristle "

1327
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,320
" Don't grumble
Give a whistle "

1328
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,440
" And this'll help things
turn out for the best "

1329
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,480
" And "

1330
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,200
" Always look
on the bright side of life "

1331
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,680
" Always look
on the light side of life "

1332
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,600
" lf life seems jolly rotten
there's something you've forgotten "

1333
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,160
" And that's to laugh and smile
and dance and sing "

1334
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,520
" When you're feeling in the dumps "

1335
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,520
" Don't be silly chumps "

1336
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:25,960
" Just purse your lips and
whistle, that's the thing "

1337
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,600
" And always look
on the bright side of life "

1338
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,600
" Always look
on the bright side of life "

1339
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,840
" For life is quite absurd "

1340
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,840
" And death's the final word "

1341
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,240
" You must always face
the curtain with a bow "

1342
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,560
" Forget about your sin "

1343
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,560
" Give the audience a grin "

1344
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,040
" Enjoy it, it's
your last chance anyhow "

1345
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:02,680
" So always look
on the bright side of death "

1346
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,680
" Just before you draw
your terminal breath "

1347
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,600
" Life's a piece of shit
when you look at it "

1348
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:21,560
" Life's a laugh and
death's a joke, it's true "

1349
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,880
" You'll see it's all a show
People laughing as you go "

1350
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,120
" Just remember that
the last laugh is on you "

1351
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:34,480
" And always look
on the bright side of life "

1352
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:43,040
" Always look
on the right side of life "

1353
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,960
Come on, Brian. Cheer up.

1354
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,840
" Always look
on the bright side of life "

1355
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:58,880
" Always look
on the right side of life "

1356
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,880
Worse things happen
at sea, you know?

1357
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,720
" Always look
on the bright side of life "

1358
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,160
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing.

1359
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,720
You go back to nothing.
What have you lost?

1360
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,800
Nothing!
" Always look
on the right side of life "

1361
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,880
Nothing will come from nothing.
You know what they say?

1362
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,880
" Always look on "
