6
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,036
Good morning.

7
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,417
I'm Dr. Jung.

8
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,419
I admitted you yesterday.

9
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,715
I'm...

10
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,927
I'm not...
I'm not mad, you know.

11
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,433
Let me explain
what I have in mind.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,603
I propose that we meet here,
most days,

13
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,397
to talk for an hour or two.

14
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:27,982
Talk?

15
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,110
Yes, just talk.

16
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,155
See if we can identify
what's troubling you.

17
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,741
So as to distract you
as little as possible,

18
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,911
I'm gonna sit there,
behind you.

19
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,747
I'm gonna ask you to try not
to turn around and look at me

20
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,707
under any circumstances.

21
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,796
Now...

22
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,644
Have you any idea

23
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,856
what may have brought on
these attacks you suffer from?

24
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,905
Hum... Humiliation.

25
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:23,246
Any... Any kind of...

26
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,331
Of humiliation.

27
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:30,003
I can't bear to see it and
it makes me feel nauseated.

28
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:36,009
I... I start pouring with sweat,
cold sweat.

29
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,011
My... My...

30
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,683
My... My... My father

31
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,185
lost his temper all the time.

32
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,688
He was always angry with...

33
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,196
When you stopped talking
just now,

34
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,575
did a thought come into your head?

35
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,329
I don't know.

36
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,539
Or an image, perhaps.

37
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,333
Was it an image?

38
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,876
Yes. Yes.

39
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,378
What was the image?

40
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,382
It was... It was a hand. My...

41
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,051
My...

42
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,262
My... My father's hand.

43
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,389
Why do you think you saw that?

44
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,062
When... Whenever he would...

45
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,524
After... Whenever he...

46
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,237
Whenever he hit us,

47
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,448
afterwards we had to...

48
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,534
We had to kiss his hand.

49
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,375
What's odd is, that case
I was writing up last week,

50
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,086
I happened to pick
the code name "Sabina S."

51
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,547
And here she is,
Sabina Spielrein.

52
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,758
Quite a coincidence.

53
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,803
As you know, I don't believe
there is such a thing.

54
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,599
Spielrein's not
a very Russian name.

55
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,102
No, Jewish.

56
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,271
Father is a very successful
import-export man.

57
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,440
And she's exceptionally
well-educated.

58
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,484
Speaks fluent German.

59
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,445
Aspires to be a doctor herself,
apparently.

60
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,614
Perhaps she's the one.

61
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,076
What one?
The one you've been looking for.

62
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,830
For your experimental treatment,
the talking cure.

63
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,792
You're so astute.

64
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,628
I've already begun it with her.

65
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,006
He's kicking.

66
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,757
Can you feel?

67
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,887
Oh, yes. There he is.

68
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,767
What I don't understand
is why Freud,

69
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,729
having proposed this
radical therapeutic idea,

70
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,399
this talking cure,
this psychanalysis,

71
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,862
then lets years go by without giving
an outline of his clinical procedures.

72
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,155
What's he playing at?

73
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,324
Presumably he uses
the method on his patients.

74
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,493
No idea.

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,163
So might you be
the first doctor to try this out?

76
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,706
It's possible.

77
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,708
Why don't you write
and ask him?

78
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,710
I don't know him.

79
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,464
As it happens,

80
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,009
Spielrein's mother wanted
to take her to see Freud.

81
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,512
Another coincidence.

82
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,851
My father thinks my mother
doesn't love him.

83
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,562
And he's right, she doesn't.

84
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,606
How do you know?

85
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,984
My angel told me.

86
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,361
What angel?

87
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,656
An... An inner voice.

88
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,576
He used to tell me
I was an exceptional person.

89
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,995
For some reason,
he always spoke in German.

90
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:55,083
Angels always speak German.
It's traditional.

91
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,712
He gave me the power to know what people are
going to say before they open their mouths.

92
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,882
Useful ability for a doctor.

93
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,385
You hope to be a doctor
someday, don't you?

94
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,389
I'll never be a doctor.
Why not?

95
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,528
I have to go away for a while.

96
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,364
I'm sorry.
We've just gotten started.

97
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:30,201
Military service. We all have to do it.
It's all a waste...

98
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,954
Just for a couple weeks.
It's a waste of time!

99
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,248
I can't tell you what
you want to know!

100
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,083
You're just making me angry.

101
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,877
Even if I could tell you,
you'd be sorry you ever...

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,091
Anyway, there's nothing wrong with me.
I don't even want to get better!

103
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,512
Stop it!

104
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,100
What? I was only trying to...
Will you just stop that?

105
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,937
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,485
Can we get back now?
Yes, if you want to.

107
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,362
I need to get back.

108
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,616
It's a complete waste of my time.

109
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,246
Writing prescriptions
for athlete's foot

110
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,832
and examining cocks
from morning till night.

111
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,043
Is that what you do?

112
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,795
It's not good for me.

113
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,964
It's not good for my patients.

114
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,735
You're playing with your food.

115
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,738
I'm not hungry.

116
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,573
Is that so?

117
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,204
I shall have to tell
Professor Bleuler.

118
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,666
Do what you like.

119
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,898
Please, miss.
Miss, give me your hand. Come...

120
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,149
Please.

121
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,026
You'll catch your death.

122
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,361
Miss Spielrein?

123
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,200
The Herr Direktor.

124
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:38,204
I feel you may have a little
too much time on your hands.

125
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,208
I'm a believer in getting our patients
involved in some productive work.

126
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,585
What are your
particular interests?

127
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,797
Suicide.

128
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,216
Interplanetary travel.

129
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,343
When Dr. Jung returns,

130
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,138
I shall ask him to discuss all this
with you in more detail.

131
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,977
You keep him away from me.
I never want to see him again!

132
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:13,447
Now, come along.
Don't make such a fuss.

133
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,420
Please. Lie still.

134
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,970
Hello?

135
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,307
I'm back.

136
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,475
How have you been?

137
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:48,733
I've been talking to the Herr Direktor
about finding some work for you.

138
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,360
I told him you're interested
in medicine.

139
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:55,948
He suggested you might like to assist
me occasionally in my research.

140
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,664
We're quite short-staffed,
so it would certainly be a help to me.

141
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:02,932
Vienna.

142
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,142
Woods.

143
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,811
Box.

144
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,187
Bed.

145
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,940
- Money.
- Bank.

146
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,028
Child.

147
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,030
Soon.

148
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,075
Family.

149
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,415
Unit.

150
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,458
Sex.

151
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,043
Um...

152
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,546
Male.

153
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,381
Wall.

154
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,633
Flower.

155
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,388
Young.

156
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,018
Baby.

157
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:51,856
Ask.
Answer.

158
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:53,858
Cap.
Wear.

159
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,818
Stubborn.

160
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,820
Give way.

161
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,283
Ruefulness.

162
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,540
Child.

163
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,047
Fame.
Doctor.

164
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,928
Divorce.

165
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,934
No.

166
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,606
Thank you.

167
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,778
Is that all?
That's all.

168
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,491
How did I do?
Beautifully.

169
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,541
Goodbye.

170
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,252
Yes, goodbye.

171
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,805
Any preliminary observations?

172
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,812
Obviously, what's uppermost
in her mind is her pregnancy.

173
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,607
Good.

174
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,985
And she's a little...

175
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:22,863
What's the word?

176
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,201
Why don't we try a useful word
invented by our Herr Direktor?

177
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,328
"Ambivalent."

178
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,829
Yes.

179
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,999
About the baby.

180
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,545
Anything else?
I'd say she was worried

181
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,798
her husband might be
losing interest in her.

182
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,344
What makes you think that?

183
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:49,848
Long reaction times to the words
"family" and "divorce."

184
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,976
I see.

185
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,229
When you said "cap,"
she said "wear."

186
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:58,315
Might that be a reference
to contraception?

187
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,152
You have quite a flair
for this.

188
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,698
Can I ask you something?

189
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,533
Of course.

190
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,744
Is she your wife?

191
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,216
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,762
Sorry?

193
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,140
I promised you a son
on Christmas Day,

194
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,560
and here she is a day late
and the wrong sex.

195
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,235
Don't be absurd.

196
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,084
"A" for Agathe.

197
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,255
Next time, I'll give you a boy.

198
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,969
Can you explain why your
nights have been so bad?

199
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,478
I'm afraid.
Of what?

200
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,734
There's something in the room.
Something like...

201
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,279
Like a cat, only it can speak.

202
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,531
It gets into bed with me.

203
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,495
Last...

204
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:40,417
Last night, it suddenly
whispered something in my ear.

205
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,670
I couldn't hear what.

206
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,131
But then...

207
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:02,356
I felt it against my back.

208
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:08,028
Something slimy like...

209
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,532
Like...

210
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,286
Like some kind of a mollusk,

211
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,831
moving against my back.

212
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,627
But when I...

213
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,880
When I turned around,
there was nothing there.

214
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,010
You felt it against your back?

215
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,346
Yes.

216
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,807
Were you naked?

217
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,978
I was.

218
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,021
Were you masturbating?

219
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,985
Yes.

220
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,699
Tell me about the
first time you can remember

221
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,909
being beaten by your father.

222
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,163
I suppose I was...

223
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,125
I was about 4.

224
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,339
I had broken a plate or...

225
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,093
Oh, yes.

226
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,137
And he told me...

227
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,642
to go into the little room

228
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,645
and take my clothes off.
And then...

229
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,984
he came in and...

230
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,366
spanked me. And then I...

231
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,288
I was so frightened

232
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,416
I wet myself, and then he...

233
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,586
He hit me again.

234
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,423
And then I...

235
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:57,679
That first time, how did you feel
about what was happening?

236
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,269
I liked it.

237
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,608
Would you repeat that, please?
I couldn't quite hear.

238
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,068
I...

239
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,404
I liked it.

240
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,410
It excited me.

241
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,499
And did you continue
to like it?

242
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,003
Yes!

243
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,757
Yes.

244
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,471
Before long, he only...
He just had to...

245
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,933
To say to me to go to
the little room and I would...

246
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,187
I would start to get wet.

247
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,528
When it came to my...

248
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,866
My brothers,
or even just threatened,

249
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,119
that... That was enough.

250
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,246
I'd have to go down and...

251
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:08,500
I wanted to lie down
and touch myself.

252
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,045
Later at school, anything would...

253
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,673
Anything would set it off. Any...

254
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,217
Any kind of humiliation.

255
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,178
I looked for any humiliation.

256
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,098
Even here, when you...

257
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,476
You hit my coat with your stick.

258
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:32,065
I had to come back right away,
I was so excited.

259
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,034
There's...

260
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,830
There's no hope for me.

261
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,957
I'm...

262
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,376
I'm vile

263
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,005
and filthy

264
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,090
and corrupt.

265
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,884
I must...

266
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,263
I must never be let out of here.

267
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
So good to meet you
at long last.

268
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,228
Professor Freud.

269
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,523
You're most welcome.

270
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,900
Please.

271
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,283
Perhaps the terms themselves
should be reviewed.

272
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,788
If, for instance, we could come up
with some milder term than "libido,"

273
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,833
we might not encounter
such emotional resistance.

274
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,293
It would make the teaching
side much easier.

275
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,005
Is euphemism a good idea?

276
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,424
Once they work out
what we actually mean,

277
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,718
they'll be just as appalled
as ever.

278
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,972
I take your point. But I still think
it's worth trying to sweeten the pill

279
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,433
when it comes to
questions of sexuality.

280
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,145
By the way, please don't feel
you have to restrain yourself here.

281
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,356
My family are all veterans
of the most unsuitable topics

282
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,775
of mealtime conversation.

283
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,081
I have a number
of clinical examples

284
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:57,044
which I believe support my
position with regard to sexuality.

285
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,670
Hmm.

286
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,509
And how is
your little Russian patient?

287
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,306
As I told you,
after the initial abreaction,

288
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,683
there was the most dramatic
improvement.

289
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,187
We've enrolled her in the medical
school at the university.

290
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,813
She's doing extremely well.

291
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,692
She's a walking advertisement for
the effectiveness of psychanalysis.

292
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,903
"Psychoanalysis."

293
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,323
Well...

294
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,200
It's more logical.

295
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,996
And it sounds better.

296
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,373
If you say so.

297
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,380
Are you still treating her?

298
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:47,803
Yes. And we continue
to unearth new material.

299
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,096
For example,

300
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,891
the extraordinary procedure
she devised as a small child

301
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:56,937
where she would sit on one heel,
attempt to defecate,

302
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,273
and at the same time, try to
prevent herself from defecating.

303
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,733
Mm.

304
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,404
She said this gave rise
to the most blissful feelings.

305
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,116
Nice story.

306
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,411
My patients who remain fixated at the
anal stage of their erotic development

307
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,081
come out with the most
amusing details.

308
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:19,876
And of course, all of them
are finicky, compulsively tidy,

309
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,337
stubborn,
and extremely stingy with money.

310
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,465
No doubt your Russian
conforms to this pattern.

311
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,801
Well, no, she doesn't.

312
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,014
The masochistic aspects
of her condition

313
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:36,935
are much more deeply rooted than
any anal fixations we've uncovered.

314
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,146
The two are intimately connected.

315
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:43,400
I can only tell you
that she's rather disorganized,

316
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,944
emotionally generous,

317
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,904
and exceptionally idealistic.

318
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,616
Well, perhaps
it's a Russian thing.

319
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,829
Is she a virgin?

320
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,124
Yes. Certainly.

321
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,959
Hmm.

322
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,128
Almost certainly.

323
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,715
No, certainly.

324
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,319
I don't think you have a notion
of the true strengths

325
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,779
of the opposition to our work.

326
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,990
There's a whole medical
establishment

327
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,784
baying to send Freud
to the auto-da-fé.

328
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,913
That's nothing compared
to what happens when our ideas

329
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,458
trickle through in whatever garbled
form they're relayed to the public.

330
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,712
The denials, the frenzy,
the incoherent rage.

331
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,424
But might that not be caused
by your insistence

332
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,845
on the exclusively sexual
interpretation of the clinical material?

333
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,263
Hmm.

334
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,434
All I'm doing is pointing out what
experience indicates must be the truth.

335
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,895
I can assure you that
in a hundred years,

336
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,856
our work will still be rejected.

337
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,611
Columbus, you know, had no idea
what country he'd discovered.

338
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,072
Like him, I'm in the dark.

339
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,868
All I know is I've set foot on the
shore and the country exists.

340
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,829
I think of you more as Galileo.

341
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,333
And your opponents
as those who condemned him

342
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,753
while refusing even
to put their eye to his telescope.

343
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,216
In any event,
I have simply opened a door.

344
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,386
It's for the young men like yourself
to walk through it.

345
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,389
I'm sure you have many
more doors to open for us.

346
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,393
Of course,
there's the added difficulty...

347
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,480
More ammunition for our enemies...

348
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:50,777
...that all of us here in Vienna, in our
psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.

349
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,447
I don't see
what difference that makes.

350
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:03,248
That, if I may say so,
is an exquisitely Protestant remark.

351
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,881
I dreamed...

352
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,218
I dreamed about a horse

353
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,723
being hoisted by cables
to a considerable height.

354
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,268
Suddenly a cable breaks, and the
horse is dashed to the ground.

355
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,812
But it's not hurt.

356
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,273
It leaps up and gallops away,

357
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,485
impeded only by a heavy log, which
it's obliged to drag along the ground.

358
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:36,072
Then a rider on a small horse
appears in front of it

359
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,241
so that it's forced to slow down.

360
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,202
And a carriage appears
in front of the small horse,

361
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,582
so that our horse is compelled
to slow down even more.

362
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,963
I imagine the horse is yourself.

363
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,798
Yes.

364
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,926
Your ambition has been frustrated
in some way.

365
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,305
The rider slowing me down.

366
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,765
Yes.

367
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,519
I think this may refer
to my wife's first pregnancy.

368
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,606
I had to give up an opportunity
to go to America because of it.

369
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,149
Ah.

370
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,611
The carriage in front

371
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:18,281
perhaps alludes to an apprehension
that our two daughters,

372
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:22,827
and other children still to come,
will impede my progress even more.

373
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,664
As a father of six,
I can vouch for that.

374
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,501
Not to mention
inevitable financial difficulties.

375
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,213
No. Fortunately, my wife
is extremely wealthy.

376
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,050
Ah. Ahem.

377
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,094
Yes.

378
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,429
That is fortunate.

379
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,525
This log.
Yes?

380
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:58,196
I think you should entertain the
possibility that it represents the penis.

381
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,742
Yes.

382
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,329
In which case,
what may be at issue

383
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:09,833
is that a certain sexual constraint
has been brought about

384
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:13,378
by a fear of a succession
of endless pregnancies.

385
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,715
I'm bound to say that if a patient
brought me this dream,

386
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,385
I'd say the number
of restraining elements

387
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,721
surrounding this unfortunate horse

388
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:27,058
could perhaps point
to the determined suppression

389
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,104
of some unruly
sexual desire. Hm?

390
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,523
Yes.

391
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,443
There is that as well.

392
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,078
I wonder if you're aware of the fact

393
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,914
that our conversation
has so far lasted

394
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,584
13 hours.

395
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

396
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,507
My dear young colleague,
please don't apologize.

397
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,759
It was our first meeting.

398
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,971
We had a great deal
to say to one another.

399
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,100
And unless I'm much mistaken,

400
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,103
we always will.

401
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,357
I shall have to be
extremely careful.

402
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,776
What do you mean? Why?

403
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,154
He's so persuasive,
he's so convincing.

404
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,115
He makes you feel you should
abandon your own ideas

405
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,159
and simply follow in his wake.

406
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:30,163
His followers in Vienna
are all deeply unimpressive.

407
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,834
Bohemians and degenerates just picking
up the crumbs from his table.

408
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,587
Perhaps he's reached
the stage where obedience

409
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,839
is more important to him
than originality.

410
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,049
Hmm.

411
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,885
I tackled him about
his obsession with sexuality,

412
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:48,473
his insistence on interpreting
every symptom in sexual terms,

413
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,267
but he's completely inflexible.

414
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,812
In my case, of course,
he'd have been right.

415
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,317
Yes, as you would expect him
to be in many cases.

416
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,487
Possibly even
a majority of cases.

417
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:07,575
But there must be more than
one hinge into the universe.

418
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,516
Do you like Wagner?

419
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,518
The music and the man, yes.

420
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,020
I'm very interested
in the myth of Siegfried.

421
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,107
The idea that something
pure and heroic can come...

422
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,693
Can perhaps
only come from a sin,

423
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,195
even a sin as dark as incest.

424
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,199
What? This is very strange,

425
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,994
As I've told you, I don't
believe in coincidence.

426
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,039
I believe nothing happens by accident.
All these things have significance.

427
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:58,209
Fact is, I'm writing something
about the Siegfried myth.

428
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,211
Are you really?
I assure you.

429
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,507
Which is your favorite of the operas?
Das Rheingold.

430
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,886
Yes, that's right. Mine too.

431
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,433
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

432
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:20,732
Do you think there's any possibility
I could ever be a psychiatrist?

433
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,610
I know you could.

434
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,071
I hear nothing but good reports
on your work at the university.

435
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,241
You're exactly
the kind of person we need.

436
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,077
Insane, you mean?

437
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,873
Yes.

438
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,084
We sane doctors
have serious limitations.

439
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,670
<i>Dear friend,</i>

440
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,924
<i>I feel I can at last permit myself
this informal mode of address</i>

441
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,095
<i>as I ask you to grant me
a very particular favor.</i>

442
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:55,516
<i>Dr. Otto Gross,
a most brilliant but erratic character,</i>

443
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,936
<i>is urgently in need
of your medical help.</i>

444
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,189
<i>I consider him,
apart from yourself,</i>

445
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:06,110
<i>the only man capable of making
a major contribution to our field.</i>

446
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,447
<i>Whatever you do,
don't let him out before October,</i>

447
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:12,700
<i>when I shall be able
to take him over from you.</i>

448
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,786
<i>And remember
his father's warning,</i>

449
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,456
<i>made when Otto</i>

450
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,876
<i>"Watch out for him. He bites."</i>

451
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,796
You still feel threatened
by your father?

452
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:31,594
Anyone with any sense
feels threatened by my father.

453
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,846
He is extremely threatening.

454
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,978
His wish to have you hospitalized,

455
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:45,692
you don't think that arises
from a concern for your welfare?

456
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:48,861
Listen.

457
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:58,830
What does any
normal old patriarch want

458
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,374
in the twilight of his life?

459
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,837
Grandchildren, grandsons.

460
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,339
Am I right?

461
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,844
And yet, last summer,

462
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:18,641
when I presented him with not one,
but two little Grosses,

463
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,353
one by my wife,

464
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:27,567
one by one of my most
respectable mistresses...

465
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,696
was he grateful?

466
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,496
And now that there's
another one on the way,

467
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,332
admittedly by some woman
I hardly know,

468
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,210
he's apoplectic.

469
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,380
And all he can think is
to get me banged away

470
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,174
in some institution.

471
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,430
You got any children?
Two girls.

472
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,057
Same mother?
Yes.

473
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,065
So you're not a believer
in monogamy?

474
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,318
For a neurotic like myself,

475
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,905
I can't possibly imagine
a more stressful concept.

476
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,161
And you don't find it
necessary or desirable

477
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:23,372
to exercise some restraint
as a contribution, say,

478
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,042
to the smooth functioning
of civilization.

479
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,378
What, and make myself ill?

480
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,673
I should have thought that
some form of sexual repression

481
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,677
would have to be practiced
in any rational society.

482
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:41,224
No wonder the hospitals
are bulging at the seams.

483
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,063
Tell me,

484
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:51,275
do you find the best way to enhance
your popularity with patients

485
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,779
is to tell them whatever it is
they most want to hear?

486
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:57,740
Does it matter whether
we're popular with them or not?

487
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,700
Well, I don't know.

488
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,452
Suppose you want to fuck them.

489
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:12,839
If there is one thing I've learned
in my short life, it's this:

490
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,467
Never repress anything.

491
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,932
So you've never slept with
any of your patients?

492
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,019
Of course not.

493
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,354
I have to steer
through the temptations

494
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,441
of transference
and countertransference.

495
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,652
That's an essential stage
of the process.

496
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,363
When transference occurs,

497
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,159
when the patient
becomes fixated on me,

498
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:29,206
I explain to her that this is a symbol
of her wretched monogamous habits.

499
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,793
I assure her that it's fine
to want to sleep with me,

500
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,212
but only if, at the same time,

501
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:40,092
she acknowledges that she wants to
sleep with a great many other people.

502
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,719
Suppose she doesn't?

503
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,723
Then it's my job to convince her
that it's part of the illness.

504
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,438
That's what people are like.

505
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:55,399
If we don't tell them
the truth, who will?

506
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,235
You think Freud's right?

507
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:02,698
You think all neurosis
is of exclusively sexual origin?

508
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:07,578
I think Freud's
obsession with sex

509
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:11,832
probably has a great deal to do
with the fact that he never gets any.

510
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,627
You could be right.

511
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:21,550
It seems to me a measure of the
true perversity of the human race

512
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:25,262
that one of its very few
reliably pleasurable activities

513
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,350
should be the subject of
so much hysteria and repression.

514
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,604
But not to repress yourself

515
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:38,484
is to unleash all kinds of
dangerous and destructive forces.

516
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,614
Our job is to make our patients
capable of freedom.

517
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:50,496
I've heard it said that you helped
one of your patients to kill herself.

518
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,624
She was resolutely suicidal.

519
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,420
I just explained how she could do it
without botching it.

520
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,967
Then I asked her if she didn't prefer
the idea of becoming my lover.

521
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,973
She opted for both.

522
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,309
That can't be what we want
for our patients.

523
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,734
Freedom is freedom.

524
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,196
I've been thinking
about Wagner's opera.

525
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,992
In it, he says that perfection
can only be arrived at

526
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,537
through what is conventionally
thought of as sin. Right?

527
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:35,124
Which must surely
have to do with the energy

528
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,334
created by the friction
of opposites.

529
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,337
Not just that you're the doctor
and I'm the patient,

530
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,840
but that you're Swiss
and I'm Russian.

531
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:47,678
I'm Jewish and you're Aryan, and
all other kinds of darker differences.

532
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,513
Darker?

533
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:55,186
If I'm right, only the clash
of destructive forces

534
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,438
can create something new.

535
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,525
When my father brought me
to you, I was very ill,

536
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:03,861
and my illness was sexual.

537
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:08,199
It's clear that the subject I'm studying
is entirely grounded in sexuality.

538
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,869
Naturally, I'm becoming more
and more acutely aware of the fact

539
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,413
that I have no sexual experience.

540
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,918
Law students are not normally
expected to rob banks.

541
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,812
It's generally thought to be the man
who should take the initiative.

542
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,857
Don't you think there's
something male in every woman

543
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:44,026
and something female
in every man?

544
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:47,238
Or should be?
Maybe.

545
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,117
I expect you're right, yes.

546
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:56,497
If you ever want to
take the initiative,

547
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,749
I live in that building there,

548
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,502
where the bay window is.

549
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:20,271
I can't understand
what you're waiting for.

550
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,440
Just take her
to some secluded spot

551
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,110
and thrash her
to within an inch of her life.

552
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,529
That's clearly what she wants.

553
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,824
How can you deny her
such a simple pleasure?

554
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,618
Pleasure is never simple,
as you very well know.

555
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,581
It is.

556
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,624
Of course it is.

557
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,294
Until we decide to complicate it.

558
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:47,131
What my father calls maturity.

559
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,508
What I call surrender.

560
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:53,971
Surrender, for me,
would be to give in to these urges.

561
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,222
Then surrender.

562
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,517
Doesn't matter what you call it

563
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:01,729
as long as you don't let
the experience escape.

564
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,649
That's my prescription.

565
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm supposed to be
treating you.

566
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,989
And it's been most effective.

567
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,997
I'd say the analysis
was not too far from completion.

568
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,459
Mine, yes.

569
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,837
Not so sure about yours.

570
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,133
I've been spending
so much time with him.

571
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,012
I'm afraid I've been neglecting
some of my other patients.

572
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:40,517
He's immensely seductive,
quite sure he's right,

573
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:43,103
and obsessionally neurotic.

574
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,398
Pretty dangerous, in fact.

575
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,362
Do you mean you doubt
your powers to convince him?

576
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,281
Worse than that.

577
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,868
What I'm afraid of
is his power to convince me.

578
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,580
On the subject of monogamy,
for example.

579
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,375
Why should we put
so much frantic effort

580
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,670
into suppressing
our most basic natural instincts?

581
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:11,257
I don't know. You tell me.

582
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,562
Thank you.

583
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:28,732
<i>I really needed that.</i>

584
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:08,647
<i>Dr. Jung,</i>

585
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:13,569
<i>rest assured that, thanks to you,
I am alive and healthy.</i>

586
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:18,324
<i>But please be so good
as to tell my father that I am dead.</i>

587
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:23,954
<i>And whatever you do, do not pass by
the oasis without stopping to drink.</i>

588
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,790
<i>Otto.</i>

589
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:50,856
Who is it?

590
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:53,025
A friend.

591
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,868
Come inside.

592
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,549
It's so beautiful.

593
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,051
I feel as though
we've always lived here.

594
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:04,513
They say we'll be able to move
in by the end of the week.

595
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,226
I'm sorry
to be like this again.

596
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:11,103
What do you mean?

597
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:13,814
So big and unattractive.

598
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,899
Don't be absurd.

599
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:20,988
I expect you wish you were a
polygamist, like Otto Gross.

600
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:29,288
If I were, it would be something
quite different than what we have,

601
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,415
which is sacred.

602
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,793
I would have to be sure
you understood that.

603
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,047
I wouldn't want to know
anything about it.

604
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,594
I have a surprise for you.

605
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,437
The boat you always wanted,

606
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,981
with red sails.

607
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:00,444
Thank you.

608
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,198
Thank you for all of this.

609
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:06,950
You're a good man.

610
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:11,121
You deserve everything
that's good.

611
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,553
If I say something,

612
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,640
will you promise not
to take it the wrong way?

613
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:32,809
What?

614
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:38,565
Don't you think we ought to stop?

615
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,068
Now.

616
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,364
I'm married.

617
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,700
Obviously, I'm being deceitful.

618
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,663
Is it right for us
to perpetuate this deceit?

619
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,540
Do you want to stop?

620
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,750
Of course I don't.

621
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:05,259
When you make love
to your wife...

622
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:09,054
how is it?

623
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,015
Describe it to me.

624
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:19,565
When you live under the same roof
with someone, it becomes habit.

625
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,195
You know,
it's always very tender.

626
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,324
Then this is another thing.

627
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,286
Another thing,

628
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:34,538
in another country.

629
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:41,587
With me,

630
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,715
I want you to be ferocious.

631
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,052
I want you to punish me.

632
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:10,240
I knew it was a boy this time.
I told you.

633
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,576
I believed you.

634
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,124
Will you come back to us now?

635
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:27,818
Pity. I should never have
sent Dr. Gross to you.

636
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,986
I blame myself.

637
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,905
No, I'm very grateful you did.

638
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:36,201
All those provocative discussions helped
crystallize a lot of my thinking.

639
00:50:36,368 --> 00:50:37,953
Hmm.

640
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,707
Did he really send you
his hotel bill?

641
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,334
Only for a couple of nights.

642
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,757
He's an addict.
I can see that now.

643
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:54,928
He can only end by doing
great harm to our movement.

644
00:50:57,848 --> 00:51:02,769
You realize this makes you
undisputed crown prince, don't you?

645
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:05,105
My son and heir.

646
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:08,275
I'm not sure I deserve
such an accolade.

647
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:11,361
Heh-heh-heh.
Don't say another word.

648
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:16,700
I often take my walk up here.

649
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:20,912
It's inspired
some of my best ideas.

650
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:24,666
You mustn't think
I have a closed mind.

651
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,002
I have absolutely no objection

652
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,921
to your studying telepathy
or parapsychology

653
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,257
to your heart's content.

654
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:37,262
But I would make the point
that our own field is so embattled

655
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:41,725
that it can only be dangerous
to stray into any kind of mysticism.

656
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:46,938
Don't you see? We have to stay within the
most rigorously scientific confines.

657
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:54,404
You all right?
Yes. But I can't agree with you.

658
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,532
Why should we draw
some arbitrary line

659
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:00,076
and rule out whole areas
of investigation?

660
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:03,079
Precisely because
the world is full of enemies,

661
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:05,999
looking for any way they can
to discredit us.

662
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:10,086
And the moment they see us abandon
the firm ground of sexual theory

663
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:14,257
to wallow in the black mud
of superstition, they will pounce.

664
00:52:19,513 --> 00:52:24,434
As far as I'm concerned, even to raise
these subjects is professional suicide.

665
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:29,940
I knew that was going to happen.
What?

666
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:32,234
I felt something like that
would happen.

667
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,569
I had a kind of burning
in my stomach.

668
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,614
What are you talking about?
It's the heating.

669
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:40,116
The wood in the bookcase
cracked, that's all.

670
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:44,287
No. It's what's known as a catalytic
exteriorization phenomenon.

671
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:45,497
A what?

672
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:48,458
A catalytic exteriorization
phenomenon.

673
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:50,085
Don't be ridiculous.

674
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:52,963
My diaphragm
started to glow red-hot.

675
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:56,800
Look, I know it's late.
It's going to happen again.

676
00:52:56,967 --> 00:53:00,011
What?
In a minute, it's going to happen.

677
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,055
My dear young friend,
this is exactly

678
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:04,432
what I'm talking about.
You must promise...

679
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:07,185
You see?

680
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:08,812
That's just...

681
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,313
You can't be serious.

682
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,150
There are so many mysteries,
so much further to go.

683
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,319
Please.
We can't be too careful.

684
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:19,489
We can't afford to wander
into these speculative areas.

685
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:24,786
Telepathy, singing bookcases,
fairies at the bottom of the garden.

686
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,329
It won't do.

687
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,711
It won't do.

688
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:59,487
There's a poem by Lermontov,
keeps going round my head,

689
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:03,283
about a prisoner who finally
achieves some happiness

690
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,870
when he succeeds in
releasing a bird from its cage.

691
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:10,457
Why do you think
this is preoccupying you?

692
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,710
I think it means...

693
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:18,965
that when I become a doctor,
what I want more than anything

694
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:22,052
is to give people
back their freedom,

695
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,597
the way you gave me mine.

696
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:28,391
Right. That's enough now.

697
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,065
There we go.

698
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,944
Fascinating.

699
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,029
Come along, my dear.

700
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,493
All the standard symptoms
of the nymphomaniac.

701
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,040
Yes.

702
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,086
Except that whenever anyone
responded to her advances,

703
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,171
she would run a mile.

704
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,799
That's the puzzling
feature of the case.

705
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,761
Hmm.

706
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:10,767
I must say it's a great pleasure
to see you in your natural habitat.

707
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,159
There's a rumor
running around Vienna

708
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,621
that you've taken one
of your patients as a mistress.

709
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:35,542
It's absolutely untrue.

710
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:39,087
Well, of course it is.

711
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,381
So I've been telling everyone.

712
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:43,216
What's being said?

713
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,052
Oh, I don't know.

714
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:48,805
That the woman's
been bragging about it.

715
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:51,433
That somebody is sending out
anonymous letters.

716
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,143
Usual sort of thing.

717
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,731
Bound to happen sooner or later.

718
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,734
It's an occupational hazard.

719
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:05,238
Yes.

720
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,577
I hope I'd never be stupid enough to get
emotionally involved with a patient.

721
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,416
I'm confused. I feel trapped.

722
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,170
I've trapped myself
into feeling divided, guilty.

723
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,505
I've never wanted you
to feel guilty.

724
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:24,424
I don't see how we can go on.

725
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,510
You mustn't say that.

726
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:29,429
I have some kind of illness.

727
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:32,640
Remember the love and patience
I showed when you were ill.

728
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,143
That's what I need from you now.
Of course.

729
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,063
You have it always.
Oh, please don't go.

730
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,481
I must.

731
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,024
I have to.
No.

732
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:43,193
I have to.
No!

733
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,195
I have to.

734
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:05,048
I can't say I'm sorry
to say goodbye to him.

735
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,926
Not the easiest houseguest
we've ever had.

736
00:57:08,093 --> 00:57:09,719
No.

737
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,765
I don't think he ever recovered
from the first view of the house.

738
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:19,896
Still, I suppose compared
to that tiny flat in Vienna...

739
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:26,236
Why did he refuse to meet
the Herr Direktor?

740
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:31,741
Oh, he's always been a great one for
bearing incomprehensible grudges.

741
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,162
Did he say anything to you
about anonymous letters?

742
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:46,631
Surely you didn't think I'd let you go
without putting up a fight?

743
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:55,598
Fräulein Spielrein!

744
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,936
Why are you doing this?

745
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,064
Please sit down.

746
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:05,316
And how could you
treat me this way?

747
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,027
Sit down.

748
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,205
I tried to explain to your mother.

749
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,499
How you dared
to say those things to her.

750
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:25,503
She came in waving an anonymous letter,
demanding to know if it was true.

751
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,843
I told her even if it were, the position
would not be quite as she imagined,

752
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,638
since you're no longer my patient.
Of course I'm your patient.

753
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:38,641
Technically not.
Not since I stopped charging you.

754
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,351
That's what she said.

755
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,563
I told her I didn't believe her,

756
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:48,151
and she told me you said your fee
was 20 francs a consultation.

757
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,487
I was making the point that
I'd take you back as a patient,

758
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:54,824
but I could only undertake
to see you inside this office.

759
00:58:55,867 --> 00:59:00,997
How can you
be so cold and offhand?

760
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,833
I was trying
to make her understand

761
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,753
the distinction between
a patient and a friend.

762
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:15,261
Listen...

763
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,514
I made a stupid mistake.

764
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,350
Is that what it was?

765
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,936
I broke an elementary rule
of my profession.

766
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:27,023
I'm your doctor, and I
believe I did you some good.

767
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,526
I can't forgive myself
for overstepping the mark.

768
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:34,948
I should have known that you wouldn't
be able to help wanting more.

769
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:38,910
I don't want more. I never wanted more.
I never asked for more.

770
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:40,912
You didn't have to ask.

771
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,665
Even if you're right,
which I dispute,

772
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:46,709
you think this is a proper way
to behave towards me?

773
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:49,337
Refusing to speak to me
except in your office?

774
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:50,546
I'm your physician.

775
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:54,759
From now on, that's all I can be.

776
00:59:57,095 --> 00:59:59,097
Don't you love me any more?

777
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,518
Only as your physician.

778
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:10,775
You think I'm going to stand for this?
What choice do you have?

779
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,749
And there's your 20 francs.

780
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,554
<i>Dear Professor Freud,</i>

781
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:43,474
<i>I'd be most grateful if you'd allow me
to come visit you in Vienna</i>

782
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,311
<i>on a matter of great interest
to us both.</i>

783
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:55,695
<i>Dear friend, I have just received
this extremely strange letter.</i>

784
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:59,532
<i>Do you know this woman?
Who is she?</i>

785
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:06,664
<i>As you will no doubt recall,</i>

786
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:10,084
<i>Spielrein was the case that
brought you and me together,</i>

787
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,670
<i>for which reason
I've always regarded her</i>

788
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,089
<i>with special gratitude
and affection,</i>

789
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:19,927
<i>until I understood that she was
systematically planning my seduction.</i>

790
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:23,306
<i>Now I have no idea
what her intentions may be.</i>

791
01:01:23,473 --> 01:01:25,308
<i>Revenge, I suspect.</i>

792
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:29,979
<i>I have never shown
such friendship to a patient,</i>

793
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:33,816
<i>nor have I ever been made to suffer
so much in return.</i>

794
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:37,445
<i>I am hoping you will agree
to act as a kind of go-between</i>

795
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:39,489
<i>and avert a disaster.</i>

796
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,702
<i>Your famous saying is carved.</i>

797
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,415
<i>"Whatever you do, give up
any idea of trying to cure them. "</i>

798
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:58,841
<i>Experiences like
this, however painful,</i>

799
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,719
<i>are necessary and inevitable.</i>

800
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:05,306
<i>Without them,
how can we know life?</i>

801
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,977
<i>Dear Miss Spielrein.</i>

802
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,356
<i>Dr. Jung is</i> a <i>good friend
and colleague of mine</i>

803
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:18,236
<i>whom I believe to be incapable
of frivolous or shabby behavior.</i>

804
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,822
<i>What I infer from your letter</i>

805
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:25,159
<i>is that you used to be close friends,
but are no longer so.</i>

806
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,037
<i>If this is the case,
I would urge you to consider</i>

807
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:31,374
<i>whether the feelings
that have survived this friendship</i>

808
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:33,960
<i>are not best suppressed
and forgotten,</i>

809
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:36,712
<i>and without the intervention
and involvement</i>

810
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:39,882
<i>of third persons such as myself.</i>

811
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,851
Herr Doctor.

812
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,228
Fräulein Spielrein.

813
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:02,738
What is it?

814
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,827
I heard you were leaving
the hospital.

815
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,580
As you see.

816
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:13,749
People say it's because
of the scandal I caused.

817
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,252
I've been planning
to leave anyway.

818
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,966
Well, I'm sorry if I precipitated it.

819
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:27,305
You've always been
something of a catalyst.

820
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,936
I've had a letter
from Professor Freud.

821
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:37,190
Qh, yes?

822
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:41,277
The thing that shone through
was how much he loves you.

823
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:46,324
But what was also clear
is that you denied everything.

824
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:50,912
You let him think that
I was a fantasist or a liar.

825
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,581
I don't see that
it's any of his business.

826
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,376
I've come here to ask you
to tell the truth.

827
01:03:59,462 --> 01:04:00,505
What?

828
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:03,174
I want you to write to him,
tell him everything.

829
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:07,762
Then I want him to write to me again
to confirm you've told him everything.

830
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:10,723
Are you blackmailing me?

831
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:18,064
I'm asking you to tell the truth.

832
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,650
Why is this so important to you?

833
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,321
I want him to take me
as his patient.

834
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:34,372
Does it have to be him?

835
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:38,000
It has to be him.

836
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:46,467
You don't feel the same way
about him, do you?

837
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:49,428
I'm disappointed by
his rigid pragmatism,

838
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:53,224
his insistence that nothing can
possibly exist unless some puny

839
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:56,602
or transitory intelligence
has first become aware of it.

840
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:00,022
All the same, will you write to him?

841
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:03,192
I could have damaged you,
you know.

842
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:07,196
Far worse than I did.

843
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:09,865
I chose not to.

844
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:18,165
All right, I'll do it.

845
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:23,170
Thank you.

846
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:27,216
It means everything to me.

847
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:40,563
Are you going somewhere
for the summer?

848
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:43,399
Berlin, with my parents.

849
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:48,571
But you are going to come back
to the university to qualify?

850
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,282
Of course.

851
01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:59,248
I'm going to America with Freud,
although he doesn't yet know it.

852
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,501
That's nice.

853
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:04,503
Goodbye.

854
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,599
<i>In view of my friendship for the
patient and her complete trust in me,</i>

855
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:19,352
<i>what I did was indefensible.</i>

856
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:24,273
<i>I confess this very unhappily
to you, my father figure.</i>

857
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,733
Hm.

858
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:36,619
<i>Dear Miss Spielrein,
I owe you an apology.</i>

859
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:38,496
<i>But the fact that I was wrong</i>

860
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:41,791
<i>and that the man is to be blamed
rather than the woman</i>

861
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:45,378
<i>satisfies my own need
to revere women.</i>

862
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:48,923
<i>Please accept my admiration
for the very dignified way</i>

863
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,259
<i>in which you have
resolved this conflict.</i>

864
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:58,182
Do we have all the
necessary paperwork, Ferenczi?

865
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:01,185
I have everything, professor.

866
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:02,853
Good.

867
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:07,149
I've always been in two minds
about America.

868
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:11,237
Maybe we made a foolish error.
Do they really want us there?

869
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:15,324
They postponed the Congress for two
months so that you could attend.

870
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,326
Surely that gives you
some indication.

871
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:19,203
Hm. Yes.

872
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,331
It's gonna be a great adventure.
Yes.

873
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,418
I hope you're right.

874
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:30,756
I go this way.

875
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,175
What do you mean?

876
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,554
I left my wife to make
the arrangements.

877
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:39,432
I'm afraid she's booked me
a first-class stateroom.

878
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,016
Oh.

879
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,643
I see.

880
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:05,040
I was on the Swiss-Austrian border
somewhere in the mountains at dusk.

881
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,543
There was a long wait

882
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,005
because everybody's baggage
was being searched.

883
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:14,967
I noticed a decrepit
customs official,

884
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,887
wearing the old royal
and imperial uniform.

885
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:21,265
And I was watching him
walking up and down,

886
01:08:21,432 --> 01:08:24,393
with his melancholy
and disgruntled expression,

887
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,897
when someone said to me,
"He isn't really there.

888
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:32,485
He's a ghost who still hasn't
found out how to die properly."

889
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,570
Hm.

890
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,491
Is that the whole dream?

891
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,701
All I can remember.

892
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:45,915
Did you say
the Swiss-Austrian border?

893
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,166
Yes.

894
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:50,169
Must have something
to do with us.

895
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,087
You think so?

896
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:02,973
Everybody's being searched.
Hm?

897
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:05,643
Perhaps that's an indication

898
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,729
that ideas which used
to flow freely between us

899
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:11,732
are now subject to the most
suspicious examination.

900
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:14,610
You mean the ideas
flowing in your direction.

901
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:19,281
And I'm afraid the old relic shuffling
about in this entirely useless fashion

902
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,117
must almost certainly be me.
Wait a minute.

903
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:25,538
Whom you very mercifully wish
could be put out of his misery.

904
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,542
A humane death wish.

905
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,463
Perhaps the fact
that he was unable to die

906
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,007
simply indicated
the immortality of his ideas.

907
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,592
Oh.

908
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:41,136
Yes.

909
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,976
So you agree
it must have been me?

910
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,811
Well, I didn't say that.

911
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:50,521
No.

912
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,274
Never mind.

913
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:57,486
It's a most entertaining example.
Ahem.

914
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:02,199
What about you?
Do you have a dream to report?

915
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:03,659
Mm.

916
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:07,746
I had a most elaborate dream
last night.

917
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,999
Particularly rich.

918
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,128
Well, let's hear it.

919
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:20,593
I'd love to tell you,
but I don't think I should.

920
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,096
Why ever not?

921
01:10:28,726 --> 01:10:31,520
I wouldn't want to risk
my authority.

922
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:58,213
Take it from me, what you're
looking at is the future.

923
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:04,053
You think they know we're on our
way, bringing them the plague?

924
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,039
Fräulein Spielrein.

925
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:37,252
Whose idea was it for you
to send me your dissertation?

926
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:39,797
The Herr Direktor.

927
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:43,175
Oh, yes, of course.

928
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:48,931
He kept insisting this was the kind
of material you were looking for

929
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:50,975
for your yearbook.

930
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:55,396
It certainly is a very fascinating
case you've chosen to investigate.

931
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,231
But if we're to consider it,

932
01:11:57,398 --> 01:12:00,859
there are one or two mistakes
which will have to be dealt with.

933
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:02,987
Of course.

934
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:06,907
Might you have a little time
to discuss all this?

935
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,952
Yes.

936
01:12:14,415 --> 01:12:16,041
When I left the hospital,

937
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,586
I was afraid it'd take years
to build a roster of patients,

938
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,006
but I'm already under siege.

939
01:12:23,799 --> 01:12:26,510
Anyway, I don't see why
a little more work

940
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:29,888
won't make your dissertation
eminently publishable.

941
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:33,475
Do you think we'd be able
to work on it together without...?

942
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:43,861
It's always going to be something
of a risk, us seeing one another.

943
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:45,988
Yes.

944
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:50,659
But I believe we have the character
to deal with the situation, don't you?

945
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:51,869
I hope so.

946
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:59,168
I somehow imagined you'd have
found another admirer by now.

947
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:01,920
No.

948
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:06,091
You were the jewel of great price.

949
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:16,018
Shall we say this time
next Tuesday?

950
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:19,229
And I'll start gently
ripping you to shreds.

951
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,032
Explain this analogy you make

952
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:33,202
between the sex instinct
and the death instinct.

953
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:37,873
Professor Freud
claims that the sexual drive

954
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,876
arises from a simple urge
towards pleasure.

955
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:42,669
If he's right, the question is:

956
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,506
Why is this urge so often
successfully repressed?

957
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:48,884
You had a theory involving
the impulse towards destruction

958
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:52,054
and self-destruction,
losing oneself.

959
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:56,391
Well, suppose we think
of sexuality as fusion.

960
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,812
Losing oneself, as you say,
but losing oneself in the other.

961
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:03,273
In other words, destroying
one's own individuality.

962
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,277
Wouldn't the ego, in self-defense,
automatically resist that impulse?

963
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:10,614
For selfish, not for social reasons?
Yes.

964
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:16,537
I'm saying that perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego.

965
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:22,417
In other words, the opposite
of what Freud proposes.

966
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,794
When I graduate,
I've decided to leave Zurich.

967
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:11,800
I have to.

968
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:16,180
Why?

969
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:18,807
You know why.

970
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:26,815
It's true.

971
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:33,822
I'm nothing but a philistine, Swiss,
bourgeois, complacent coward.

972
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:40,037
I want to leave everything,
break away and disappear with you.

973
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:46,293
Then comes the voice
of the philistine.

974
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,173
Where will you go?

975
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,218
Vienna, maybe.

976
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:55,761
Please don't go there.

977
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,182
I must go
wherever I need to feel free.

978
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:13,695
Don't.

979
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,378
You know your paper

980
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:32,714
led to one of the most stimulating
discussions we've ever had

981
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:35,425
at the Psychoanalytic Society.

982
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:40,722
Do you really think the sexual drive
is a demonic and destructive force?

983
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:43,892
Yes, at the same time
as being a creative force,

984
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:46,061
in the sense that it can produce

985
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:49,606
out of the destruction
of two individualities, a new being.

986
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:52,567
But the individual must always
overcome resistance

987
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:56,321
because of the self-annihilating
nature of the sexual act.

988
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,700
Hmm.

989
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:02,494
I fought against the idea
for some time,

990
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:07,958
but I suppose there must be
some kind of indissoluble link

991
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,252
between sex and death.

992
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:15,007
I don't feel the relationship
is quite the way you've portrayed it,

993
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:18,051
but I'm grateful to you
for animating the subject

994
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:20,220
in such a stimulating way.

995
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:23,807
The only slight shock
was your introduction

996
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:27,019
at the very end of your paper,
of the name of Christ.

997
01:17:29,021 --> 01:17:30,772
Are you completely opposed

998
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,984
to any kind of religious dimension
in our field?

999
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:38,155
In general, I don't care if a man
believes in Rama, Marx or Aphrodite,

1000
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:41,116
as long as he keeps it
out of the consulting room.

1001
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,162
Is that what's at the bottom
of your dispute with Dr. Jung?

1002
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:48,623
I have no dispute with Dr. Jung.

1003
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,127
I was simply mistaken about him.

1004
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:56,506
I thought he'd be able to carry
our work forward after I was gone.

1005
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:59,009
I didn't bargain
for second-rate mysticism

1006
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:02,220
and self-aggrandizing shamanism.

1007
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:06,183
Nor did I realize he could be
so brutal and sanctimonious.

1008
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:11,438
He's trying to find some way forward so
we don't just have to tell our patients,

1009
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,732
"This is why you are
the way you are."

1010
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:17,778
He wants to say, "We can show you
what it is you might want to become."

1011
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:20,155
Playing God, in other words.

1012
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,991
We have no right to do that.

1013
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:26,578
The world is as it is.

1014
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:32,417
Understanding and accepting that
is the way to psychic health.

1015
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:35,170
What good can we do
if our aim is simply

1016
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:38,215
to replace one delusion
with another?

1017
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:44,012
Well, I agree with you.

1018
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,306
Hm.

1019
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,184
I've noticed that in crucial areas
of dispute

1020
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:52,104
between Dr. Jung and myself,
you tend to favor me.

1021
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,856
I thought you had no dispute
with him.

1022
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:02,030
You still love him.

1023
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:04,866
That's not why
I'm pleading his cause. I...

1024
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:10,914
I just feel that if you two
don't find some way to coexist,

1025
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:14,960
it will hold back the progress of
psychoanalysis, perhaps indefinitely.

1026
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:18,672
Is there no way to avert
a rupture?

1027
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:23,009
Correct scientific relations
will be maintained, of course.

1028
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:26,763
I'll be seeing him at the editorial
meeting in Munich in September

1029
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,224
and I shall be perfectly civil.

1030
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:34,521
To tell you the truth, what finished him
for me was all that business about you.

1031
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:36,898
The lies, the ruthless behavior.

1032
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,276
I was very shocked.

1033
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:42,487
I think he loved me.

1034
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:45,282
I'm afraid your idea
of a mystical union

1035
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:49,578
with a blond Siegfried
was inevitably doomed.

1036
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:57,627
Put not your trust in Aryans.

1037
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:02,340
We're Jews,
my dear Miss Spielrein,

1038
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:05,594
and Jews we will always be.

1039
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,435
Now, the real reason
I invited you here this evening

1040
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:18,315
was to ask if you'd be prepared
to take on one or two of my patients.

1041
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,779
I was interested in what
you said about monotheism,

1042
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:28,575
that it arose historically out of
some kind of patricidal impulse.

1043
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:32,746
Yes.
Akhenaton, who, as far as we know,

1044
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:38,418
was the first to put forth the bizarre
notion that there was only one god.

1045
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:43,715
Also had his father's name erased and
chiseled out of all public monuments.

1046
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,467
That's not strictly true.

1047
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:48,803
Not true?
No.

1048
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:51,973
You mean it was
most probably a myth?

1049
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:56,645
No, I mean there were two perfectly
straightforward reasons for Akhenaton,

1050
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:59,231
or Amenophis IV,
as I prefer to call him,

1051
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,108
to excise his father's name
from the cartouches.

1052
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:05,487
First, this was something
traditionally done

1053
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:08,698
by all new kings who didn't
wish their father's name

1054
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:10,659
to continue as public currency.

1055
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:13,662
In the same way as your
article in the yearbook

1056
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:16,039
fails to mention my name?

1057
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:20,210
Your name is so well-known, it hardly
seemed necessary to mention it.

1058
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:21,711
Do go on.

1059
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:22,921
Secondly,

1060
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:27,842
Amenophis only struck out the first
half of his father's name, Amenhotep,

1061
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:31,346
because, like the first half of his
name, it was shared by Amen,

1062
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,848
one of the gods he was
determined to eliminate.

1063
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:37,978
As simple as that?

1064
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:41,481
The explanation doesn't
seem to me unduly simple.

1065
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:43,900
And do you think your man,

1066
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,027
whatever you call him,

1067
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:50,282
felt no hostility whatsoever
toward his father?

1068
01:21:50,657 --> 01:21:53,243
I have no means of proof,
of course.

1069
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:57,872
Amenophis may have thought his
father's name was familiar enough

1070
01:21:58,039 --> 01:22:01,167
and that now it might be time
to make a name for himself.

1071
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:25,233
How sweet it must be to die.

1072
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,823
<i>If I may say so, dear professor,</i>

1073
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:35,368
<i>you make the mistake of
treating your friends like patients.</i>

1074
01:22:35,535 --> 01:22:38,371
<i>This enables you to reduce them
to the level of children</i>

1075
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:42,250
<i>so that their only choice is
to become obsequious nonentities</i>

1076
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:45,170
<i>or bullying enforcers
of the party line</i>

1077
01:22:45,337 --> 01:22:49,424
<i>while you sit on the mountaintop,
the infallible father figure,</i>

1078
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:52,886
<i>and nobody dares to pluck you
by the beard and say,</i>

1079
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:56,640
<i>"Think about your behavior, then
decide which one of us is neurotic."</i>

1080
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:58,975
<i>I speak as a friend.</i>

1081
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:23,583
<i>Your letter cannot be answered.</i>

1082
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:29,798
<i>Your claim that I treat my friends
like patients is self-evidently untrue.</i>

1083
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:34,260
<i>As to which of us is the neurotic,
I thought we analysts were agreed</i>

1084
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:38,515
<i>a little neurosis was nothing
whatever to be ashamed of.</i>

1085
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:41,810
<i>But a man like you
who behaves quite abnormally</i>

1086
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:44,270
<i>and then stands there, shouting</i>

1087
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:49,526
<i>how normal he is, does give
considerable cause for concern.</i>

1088
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:55,073
<i>For a long time now, our relationship
has been hanging by a thread.</i>

1089
01:23:55,240 --> 01:24:00,912
<i>And a thread, moreover, mostly
consisting of past disappointments.</i>

1090
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,499
<i>We have nothing to lose
by cutting it.</i>

1091
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:18,847
<i>You will be the best judge
of what this moment means to you.</i>

1092
01:24:19,514 --> 01:24:21,725
<i>The rest is silence.</i>

1093
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,130
So good to have met you
at last, Dr. Spielrein.

1094
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:57,385
We did meet once before when I
was your husband's patient.

1095
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,055
I think you're right.

1096
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,729
Your children are glorious.

1097
01:25:09,773 --> 01:25:13,401
Thank you. You must let us
know when yours arrives.

1098
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:16,154
I expect you want a boy. No.

1099
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:19,574
No, my husband and I both
think we would prefer a girl.

1100
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:21,451
Really?

1101
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:29,667
I wish you could help him.

1102
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:32,045
Why? What's the matter?

1103
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:34,589
He's not himself.

1104
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:38,092
He's very confused
and bogged down with his book.

1105
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,054
He's not sleeping.

1106
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:43,264
He's not taking on
any new patients.

1107
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:48,686
He hasn't recovered from the violence
of his break with Professor Freud.

1108
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:53,066
What you're describing
is very unlike my memory of him.

1109
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:58,112
If you're staying in town, I'd try to
persuade him to let you analyze him.

1110
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:06,287
I know he always set great store
by your opinion.

1111
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,208
You are taking patients now?

1112
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:15,964
I've pretty much decided
to specialize in child psychology.

1113
01:26:16,464 --> 01:26:18,967
I'm not sure if it's a field
he approves of.

1114
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,262
I haven't discussed it with him,
but...

1115
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:26,850
You better go and talk to him.

1116
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,818
No one can help him
more than you.

1117
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,529
I hope you're right.

1118
01:27:01,676 --> 01:27:04,137
Your children are beautiful.

1119
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:11,895
So you're married?

1120
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:14,564
Yes.

1121
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:18,359
He's a doctor?

1122
01:27:20,028 --> 01:27:22,906
Yes.
His name is Pavel Scheftel.

1123
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:25,867
Russian.

1124
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:30,246
Yes, a Russian Jew.

1125
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:35,543
What's he like?

1126
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,005
Kind.

1127
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:44,510
Good.

1128
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:46,596
Good.

1129
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:51,392
Are you all right?
Yes.

1130
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:57,815
I haven't been sleeping very well and
I keep having this apocalyptic dream.

1131
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:02,153
A terrible flood from
the North Sea to the Alps.

1132
01:28:02,737 --> 01:28:07,450
Houses washed away.
Thousands of floating corpses.

1133
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:13,414
Eventually, it comes crashing
into the lake in a great tidal wave.

1134
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:16,668
And by this time, the water,

1135
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:21,172
roaring down
like some vast avalanche,

1136
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,300
has turned to blood.

1137
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,720
The blood of Europe.

1138
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,600
What do you think it means?

1139
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,647
I have no idea,

1140
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:40,817
unless it's about to happen.

1141
01:28:44,112 --> 01:28:45,363
What are your plans?

1142
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,826
We've been thinking
of going back to Russia.

1143
01:28:50,785 --> 01:28:52,620
As long as you leave Vienna.

1144
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,165
I spoke to him last week.

1145
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:59,293
I can't believe nothing's...
There's nothing to be done.

1146
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,587
The day he refused
to discuss a dream

1147
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:05,508
on the grounds that it might risk
his authority, I should have known.

1148
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:09,637
After that, for me,
he had no authority.

1149
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,641
It was a blow when I discovered
you'd chosen his side.

1150
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,977
It's not a question of sides.

1151
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:20,148
I have to work in the direction my
instinct tells my intelligence is right.

1152
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:22,984
Don't forget,
you cured me with his method.

1153
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:28,823
What he'll never accept is that what
we understand has got us nowhere.

1154
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,992
We have to go into
uncharted territory.

1155
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:34,912
We have to go back to the sources
of everything we believe.

1156
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:36,956
I don't want to just
open a door,

1157
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:39,667
show the patient his illness,
squatting there.

1158
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:43,671
I want to find a way to help the
patient reinvent himself, to send him

1159
01:29:43,838 --> 01:29:47,633
on a journey, at the end is waiting
the person he was intended to be.

1160
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,471
It's no good making yourself ill
in the process.

1161
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:56,017
Only the wounded physician
can hope to heal.

1162
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:09,489
I'm told you have a new mistress.

1163
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:12,033
Is that right?

1164
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:14,535
What's her name?

1165
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:16,245
Toni.

1166
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:19,499
Is she like me?
No.

1167
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,959
She's an ex-patient?

1168
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,377
Jewish? Yes.

1169
01:30:25,713 --> 01:30:26,756
Half Jewish.

1170
01:30:27,715 --> 01:30:30,259
Training to be an analyst?
Yes.

1171
01:30:31,302 --> 01:30:32,887
But she's not like me?

1172
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:37,225
Of course
she makes me think of you.

1173
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:41,395
How do you make it work?

1174
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:43,856
I don't know.

1175
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:48,903
Emma, as you've seen,
is the foundation of my house.

1176
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:52,406
Toni is the perfume in the air.

1177
01:30:59,247 --> 01:31:02,792
My love for you was the most
important thing in my life.

1178
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:04,919
For better or worse,

1179
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,631
it made me understand who I am.

1180
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:19,892
This should be mine.

1181
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:23,062
Yes.

1182
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,110
Sometimes you have to do
something unforgivable

1183
01:31:30,153 --> 01:31:32,780
just to be able to go on living.
