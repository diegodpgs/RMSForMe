1
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:15,829
The war criminals will proceed
in orderly fashion...

2
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,664
to the main waiting room
and await instructions

3
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,419
Obey the guards

4
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:29,467
War criminals must proceed
to the main waiting room

5
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:35,306
Those caught talking
will be severely punished

6
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,186
The Emperor

7
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,898
Your Majesty... His Majesty

8
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,692
What do they think they are doing?

9
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:31,985
It is dangerous

10
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:36,281
Go back

11
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:40,243
They could kill us all

12
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,983
Open the door

13
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:47,822
Open the door!

14
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:54,328
PEKING, 1908

15
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:50,090
By the command of Her lmperial Majesty
...also called the Compassionate

16
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:54,052
...and the Blessed... the
Respectful and the Long Living

17
00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:01,851
The Empress Dowager commands...
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi... Son of Prince Chun...

18
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:06,897
shall be transferred... immediately
...to the Forbidden City...

19
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:12,194
and will remain in the Great Within
awaiting Her Majesty's decision

20
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,905
Respect this

21
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,110
Ar Mo, I am giving you my Son

22
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:56,570
My son is your son

23
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:58,155
Quick, quick

24
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,887
I want to go home

25
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,016
Look. Look at the Forbidden City

26
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,443
Give him to me

27
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:27,407
Ar Mo

28
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,936
Pu Yi. Come here

29
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,872
Are you afraid of me?

30
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:22,625
Everyone is

31
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:27,714
I am the Grand Empress Dowager

32
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:33,595
And I have lived here...
for a long, long time

33
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:51,069
And they call me the Old Buddha

34
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:57,992
This is Peony

35
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:01,204
Do you like her?

36
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:08,544
Men, you know... are not allowed
in the Forbidden City after dark

37
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:14,509
Even little men like you

38
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:20,055
The only man who can live
here... is the Emperor

39
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:29,815
But the Emperor is on high
...ridding the dragon now

40
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:35,320
He died today

41
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,671
Longevity

42
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,512
These other men... they're not real men

43
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:06,933
They are all eunuchs

44
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:18,485
And now... they are all
waiting... for me to die

45
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:24,825
That is why... they are putting my
bed... in the middle of the room...

46
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:29,204
under the Black Pearl

47
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,418
Little Pu Yi

48
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:44,595
I have decided... that you will be
the new Lord of Ten Thousand Years

49
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:53,894
You will be the Son of Heaven

50
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,488
Are we going home, Papa?

51
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,561
It will soon be over

52
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,607
Look!

53
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,252
Cricket!

54
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,015
Cricket, where's the cricket?

55
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,477
He is my friend, Your Majesty

56
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,521
Safe and warm under my arm

57
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:23,026
Kept me company on the long journey here

58
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:29,365
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty

59
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:34,536
Now he can be the Emperor's cricket

60
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:47,966
Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City

61
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:54,431
This little one is... Your Majesty's bedroom

62
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,016
This is where we are

63
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,600
Am I going home today?

64
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,395
Not today

65
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,193
And here, look

66
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:25,836
I'll give Your Majesty
the Gate of Marshovala

67
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,390
I don't like baths!

68
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,853
I don't like baths

69
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,527
More beancurd today. And no meat

70
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,295
Is it true I can do anything I want?

71
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:15,883
Of course Your Majesty. Anything you want

72
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,802
You are the Lord of Ten Thousand Years

73
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:26,602
I am the Son of Heaven!

74
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:33,609
I am the Son of Heaven!

75
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,945
Ar Mo, I want to go home

76
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,908
I want to go home, I want to go home,
I want to go home, Ar Mo

77
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,827
I want to go home

78
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:09,600
Once upon a time... there was a great tree

79
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,312
and a great wind

80
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:18,442
And when the tree fell...
the monkeys were scattered

81
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,884
His soup is getting cold

82
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,345
Where am I?

83
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,514
In the People's Republic of China...

84
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,896
Why did you stop me?

85
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,566
You are a criminal. You must be judged

86
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:47,152
I repeat...

87
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:51,573
Prisoners going to their cells
will walk with their heads bowed

88
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:52,991
Keep your eyes on the ground

89
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,744
No looking forward... or to the side

90
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,121
The Guard will give you directions...

91
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,790
and tell you when to turn

92
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,514
Pu Chieh

93
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:43,580
Your guest is waiting to
meet you... Your Majesty

94
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,670
Also your mother has arrived

95
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:55,509
You have not seen your mother
for many years, Your Majesty

96
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:07,895
He is so small

97
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,773
He is young, Your Majesty

98
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:14,192
Go

99
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:22,826
The Emperor's brother.
His Excellency Pu Chieh

100
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:42,429
Ar Mo

101
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,569
How is the health of His Majesty's mother?

102
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:00,863
It is better, thank you

103
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:04,657
How much His Majesty has grown

104
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:11,206
My mother has not seen me for seven years

105
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,086
Do you remember my face?

106
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:20,005
No

107
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:24,343
The night they came with the horses
...I knew it would be like this

108
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,428
My brother sees you every day

109
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:28,472
Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you

110
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:30,349
He often talks about you

111
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:33,435
We are all very proud of you

112
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:35,396
The kite

113
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:38,232
He chose this for you

114
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:54,330
Papa

115
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:35,453
They're turning away

116
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:38,956
Of course. Ordinary people are not
allowed to look at the Emperor

117
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,541
I'm too important

118
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:43,544
Is that true that you can
do whatever you want?

119
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:45,046
Of course I can

120
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:47,965
If I am naughty someone else is punished

121
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,091
One of them

122
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:55,055
Stop

123
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:58,141
The Emperor will walk

124
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:11,612
Are they all like you?

125
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:14,031
I've got three sisters and two friends

126
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:16,367
If you come to our house...
you can play with us

127
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,786
The Emperor never leaves the palace

128
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,038
We play games together

129
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,706
I know a game too

130
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,041
Run

131
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,929
The ones on the boat are the High Consorts

132
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:24,264
High Consorts?

133
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,975
The wives of the Emperor before me

134
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,518
They say they're my mother

135
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:31,229
But they're not

136
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:36,682
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow

137
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:39,977
But it is ordinary yellow

138
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,353
It is lmperial yellow

139
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:43,105
No, it is not

140
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,481
We say it is

141
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:46,775
Only the Emperor can wear that yellow

142
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:47,901
Take it off

143
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:48,861
No

144
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:49,778
Take it off

145
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:52,531
No, and you're not the Emperor any more

146
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:54,491
There is a new Emperor now

147
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,077
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel...

148
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,037
he has got a car

149
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:00,913
What did you say?

150
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:07,462
You're not the Emperor

151
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,298
Liar

152
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,591
You're not the Emperor any more

153
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,392
You're not the Emperor

154
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:25,187
You're not the Emperor

155
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,521
How dare you!

156
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,159
You're not the Emperor!

157
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:42,328
How dare you

158
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,709
Am I the Emperor or not?

159
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,296
Your Majesty... will always be the Emperor

160
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:53,798
You see

161
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:55,424
Prove it

162
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,844
Big Foot

163
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:04,224
Drink it

164
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:08,144
Drink the green ink

165
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:29,289
I will show you

166
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,154
See, that is a car

167
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,697
He is the President of the Republic

168
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:06,215
Why is this wall here, Lord Chamberlain?

169
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:11,261
It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed here

170
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,681
You are lying

171
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:29,362
High Tutor

172
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,572
Am I still the Emperor?

173
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:36,201
You will always be the Emperor...
inside the Forbidden City...

174
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,662
but not outside

175
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,622
I do not understand

176
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,501
Outside China is now a Republic...

177
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,253
with a President

178
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:50,007
Where is Ar Mo?

179
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,948
You are all liars

180
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,373
Let me say goodbye

181
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,083
Hurry

182
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,631
He's my child

183
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,374
I do not understand

184
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:11,292
I do not understand

185
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,544
Your Majesty is a big boy now

186
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,381
He cannot have a wet nurse any more

187
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:18,173
It is much better like this

188
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:19,925
Much healthier

189
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:22,260
But she is not my wet nurse

190
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,348
She is my butterfly

191
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:46,117
Ar Mo

192
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:01,632
Ar Mo

193
00:37:57,702 --> 00:38:02,040
This is the detention centre...

194
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,709
of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security...

195
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:07,337
and I am the Governer

196
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:11,466
During the war... this was a Japanese prison

197
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,426
Many of you may remember it...

198
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:16,512
because you worked with the Japanese

199
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:19,180
You were responsible for building it...

200
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,433
and you filled it with innocent people

201
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,435
How could this happen?

202
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,229
Why did you betray your country?

203
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,982
What turned you into war criminals?

204
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,485
We believe... that men are born good

205
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,947
We believe... that the only way to change...

206
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:39,784
is to discover the truth
and look at it in the face

207
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:42,578
That is why you are here

208
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:46,373
You will begin by writing
the story of your lives...

209
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,500
and by confessing your crimes

210
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,253
Your salvation will lie entirely...

211
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:55,340
in the attitude you take

212
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:59,386
I advise you to be frank and sincere

213
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:04,933
Otherwise things can still
go very badly for you

214
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:21,281
TWILIGHTIN THE FORBIDDEN CITY

215
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:33,918
After a few years the Chinese Republic...

216
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,671
had become as corrupt as the old empire

217
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:41,676
It fell quickly into the hands of
ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats

218
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:45,597
The era of the warlords had begun

219
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:48,641
By May 1919 when I had
received my appointment...

220
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,393
China was in turmoil

221
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,058
May the new tutor present himself

222
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:18,242
Your lmperial Highness... the new tutor

223
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:23,163
Mr Reginald Fleming Johnston

224
00:42:24,872 --> 00:42:26,666
How do you do, Mr Johnston?

225
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,461
How do you do, Your Majesty

226
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,141
Now we will go to school

227
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:45,726
Your Majesty...

228
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,773
in my country it would be usual to begin
...with some kind of an examination

229
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,859
The Emperor cannot be examined

230
00:42:54,235 --> 00:42:56,361
Now that may have to change

231
00:42:56,778 --> 00:43:00,907
But first your Majesty might
like to ask me some questions?

232
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:06,121
Where are your ancestors buried?

233
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:08,540
In Scotland, Your Majesty

234
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,877
But then where's your skirt?

235
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:16,131
In your country men wear
short skirts, do they not?

236
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:19,092
No, Your Majesty, Scotsmen
do not wear skirts...

237
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,678
they wear kilts

238
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:24,263
Kilts?

239
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:26,514
A matter of words

240
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,683
perhaps but words are important

241
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:30,351
Why are words important?

242
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:33,271
If you cannot say what
you mean, Your Majesty...

243
00:43:33,396 --> 00:43:35,898
you will never mean what you say

244
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:40,153
And a gentleman should
always mean what he says

245
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:42,697
Ah yes! A gentleman

246
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:46,034
Are you a gentleman?

247
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:49,787
I would like to be a gentleman, Your Majesty

248
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:51,831
I try to be

249
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:53,541
I am not a gentleman

250
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,294
I'm not allowed to say what I mean

251
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,004
They are always telling me what to say

252
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,051
Your Majesty is still very young

253
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,223
I thought he might like to see
some English and American magazines

254
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:13,769
I have just received them

255
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:23,862
I know that you know...
that I know that you know...

256
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:28,073
that that is a dialogue between
Confucious... and Chuang-Tsu

257
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:33,328
Concerning respect, Your Majesty

258
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,093
Who is this George Washington?

259
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,887
A famous American, Your Majesty

260
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:54,307
A revolutionary General,
the first American President

261
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:57,060
Ah, like Mr Lenin in Russia?

262
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,937
Not quiet

263
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:03,065
Does he have a car?

264
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:06,986
He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty

265
00:45:07,987 --> 00:45:10,906
I want a car

266
00:45:14,618 --> 00:45:19,081
I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty

267
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:28,172
Please do not tell anyone about my mouse

268
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,933
The lesson is finished

269
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:13,007
Our official taster is a brave man

270
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:18,721
Many of my ancestors have
been poisoned, you know

271
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:24,226
Does Your Majesty have lunch
like this every day?

272
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:26,938
Oh, yes, every day. Like theatre

273
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:29,814
I do not know why.
It has always been like that

274
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:37,947
How do they kill Emperor's in the West?

275
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:42,243
The Austrian Emperor was shot, was he not?

276
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,747
But this nephew was assassinated
before the Great War

277
00:46:46,956 --> 00:46:49,208
But the Russian Emperor has been shot

278
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,751
He was called the Tsar

279
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:54,672
He took lots of our land in Manchuria

280
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:56,215
I'm a Manchurian

281
00:46:56,298 --> 00:47:00,302
Even after the Republic,
it's still my country

282
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:08,101
The, er... secret,
Your Majesty, is emerging again

283
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,870
Something is happening

284
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,626
What is happening, Mr Johnston?

285
00:47:36,544 --> 00:47:38,588
Nothing is Quiet

286
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,882
On our way here, Your Majesty...

287
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:27,260
we were held up by
students from a University

288
00:48:27,928 --> 00:48:30,888
They were protesting against
the Republican Government...

289
00:48:31,055 --> 00:48:35,309
because it has agreed to give
away Chinese territory... to Japan

290
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:39,771
Is it true, Mr Johnston...

291
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,898
that many people out there have
had their heads chopped off?

292
00:48:42,357 --> 00:48:44,317
It is true, Your Majesty...

293
00:48:44,817 --> 00:48:47,695
many heads have been chopped off

294
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:52,033
It does stop them thinking

295
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,452
It is time for the Emperor's rest

296
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:57,747
The students are right to be angry

297
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:05,296
I am angry

298
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,967
But I'm not allowed to
leave the Forbidden City

299
00:49:10,926 --> 00:49:13,720
I want to go out, Mr Johnston

300
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:19,893
My Lord, I want to see the city of sounds

301
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:31,654
The Emperor awards you... with
the order of the Ruby Hat Button...

302
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:36,867
and with the right to be carried in
your own chair with four bearers

303
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,349
I hope the Emperor has not forgotten...

304
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,727
that this is the day for his maths class

305
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:41,152
For Your Majesty

306
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:43,655
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you

307
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,115
Bad for you, nonsense

308
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:56,333
How does it work?

309
00:51:58,377 --> 00:51:59,712
Oh... it's simple

310
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:05,843
Head up and eyes forward as in life

311
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:33,578
My Mother's dead, is she not?

312
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:38,790
Yes, Your Majesty. I'm profoundly sorry

313
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,459
I'm not

314
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:46,298
She killed herself

315
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,383
She swallowed a ball of opium

316
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:54,096
I'm going to see her, and my brother

317
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,809
Open the door

318
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:29,479
Open the door!

319
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:46,746
Open the door!

320
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:42,048
Look where you lead him

321
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:45,635
And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man

322
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:47,011
The boy's Mother is dead

323
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,639
and he's not even allowed to see her

324
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:53,101
I want to go out! I want to go out!

325
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,394
Stop it. Stay where you are

326
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,687
I want to go out

327
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,772
Stop it! Stay where you are

328
00:55:58,855 --> 00:55:59,982
I want to go out!

329
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,990
Hunchback. Big Foot

330
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,105
Give me your hand, sir

331
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:48,278
Give me your hand, sir

332
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:14,470
Look at my left ear please, sir

333
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,226
And now my right

334
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:25,189
Would you follow my finger please, sir

335
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:33,446
Well, it's perfectly simple Johnstone

336
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:36,032
The Emperor needs spectacles

337
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:38,117
Like Harold Lloyd

338
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:39,952
Impossible

339
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:42,287
An Emperor does not wear spectacles

340
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:44,915
That cannot be allowed

341
00:57:44,998 --> 00:57:47,960
Times have changed, Your Highnesses

342
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,685
If His Majesty doesn't get
spectacles, Johnston...

343
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,478
he could lose his sight

344
00:58:31,585 --> 00:58:35,297
If the Emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign

345
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,925
Unfortunately, our decision is final...

346
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,886
and unfortunately what I have to say...

347
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:45,264
will be published in every newspaper in China

348
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:51,186
What do you have to say, Mr Johnston?

349
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:55,065
The Emperor has been a
prisoner in his own palace...

350
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,067
since the day that he was crowned...

351
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,320
and has remained a prisoner
since he abdicated

352
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:02,614
But, now he's growing up... he may wonder
why he's the only person in China

353
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,491
who may not walk out of his own front door

354
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:12,040
I think the Emperor is the
loneliest boy on earth

355
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,546
It would be conveniently sad...
if he becomes blind

356
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:21,466
Blind... Mr Johnston?

357
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:24,844
To the expense, Your Excellency

358
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,514
To the cost of maintaining one
thousand two hundred Eunuchs...

359
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,600
three hundred and fifty ladies-in-waiting...

360
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:33,810
and one hundred and eighty-five cooks

361
00:59:34,144 --> 00:59:37,022
To buying one hundred and
twenty sable furs a month...

362
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:39,399
and three thousand chickens a week

363
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:42,902
To the fact that eight hundred
and forty Guards and employees...

364
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:46,864
of the Household Department
plus one Lord Chamberlain...

365
00:59:47,073 --> 00:59:48,991
care only about one thing...

366
00:59:49,116 --> 00:59:52,245
filling their own rice bowls

367
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,040
You are very good at accounts, Mr Johnston

368
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:58,668
The Emperor may have abdicated...

369
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:03,630
but he is still a symbol of
great importance... to many people

370
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:08,426
If I did not agree with
that I would not be here

371
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:16,059
And some of us believe... that one
day soon he may be more than a symbol

372
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:19,563
The spectacles are a detail

373
01:00:19,688 --> 01:00:22,399
What do you really want, Mr Johnston?

374
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:26,444
Just the spectacles

375
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,662
Oh no... The Princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty

376
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:22,998
Seventeen years old

377
01:01:30,255 --> 01:01:34,051
Princess Who Jen, fifteen years old

378
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:36,802
The Princess Li Li, Your Majesty

379
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:41,599
And the Princess Fun Ying

380
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:55,529
Who is this?

381
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,074
Princess Wen Hsiu, twelve years old

382
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:01,326
She has got a funny face

383
01:02:12,253 --> 01:02:13,671
Not just one wife

384
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:16,006
One Empress and one Secondary Consort

385
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:17,341
Two wives

386
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:19,677
But, who did you choose to be the Empress?

387
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,012
They chose her, she's very old, Johnston

388
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:23,472
She's seventeen

389
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:26,642
That's not so old, Your Majesty

390
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,185
What does she look like?

391
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:29,520
Old-fashioned

392
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:31,522
I want a modern wife, Johnston

393
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:34,358
Who speaks English and French

394
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:39,071
And who can dance the quickstep

395
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:52,374
Johnston

396
01:02:55,961 --> 01:02:58,255
I'm going to escape, Johnston

397
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:01,425
I've got a suitcase and a ticket to English

398
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:04,344
I'm going to Oxford University

399
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:07,890
Your Majesty... if you get married...

400
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:11,267
you will become the master of your own house

401
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:15,438
A wedding might be a more
practical way to escape

402
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:52,097
Why did you never get married, Johnston?

403
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:07,154
The Secondary Consort welcomes the Empress

404
01:04:07,363 --> 01:04:10,699
The Empress greets the Secondary Consort

405
01:04:21,543 --> 01:04:23,294
You are doing everything every well

406
01:04:23,419 --> 01:04:25,880
Thank you. I rehearsed many times

407
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:27,606
What is his Majesty thinking?

408
01:05:27,981 --> 01:05:30,358
I was thinking if I was a real Emperor...

409
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:32,736
I would become the ruler of China now

410
01:05:33,778 --> 01:05:36,156
And what would the Emperor do...

411
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,699
if he could really rule?

412
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:39,117
I would change everything

413
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,203
Even the way we get married

414
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:44,789
Is the Emperor against arranged marriages?

415
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:48,751
It is humiliating not to
choose whom you marry

416
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:52,170
Even I was not allowed to choose

417
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:07,393
In another year or two...

418
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:09,687
His Majesty will be taller than me

419
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:14,317
Is it true the Emperor has
a suitcase under his bed...

420
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:16,945
and is going to Oxford

421
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:20,072
Will the Emperor take Wan Jung with him?

422
01:06:21,698 --> 01:06:26,286
Perhaps he would like to
see my face before he decides

423
01:06:26,954 --> 01:06:31,625
The Emperor would like to see
the face of the Empress

424
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:40,801
It is the Emperor who
must remove the kai t'ou

425
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:45,404
I also had a tutor... like Mr Johnston

426
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,533
Miss Windsor

427
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,453
She's American

428
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:25,066
Miss Windsor taught me how to
do the dance of the quickstep

429
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:29,904
Does the Emperor know how to do the quickstep?

430
01:08:30,571 --> 01:08:33,699
Will you teach me?

431
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:28,668
Leave us, leave us

432
01:09:46,936 --> 01:09:50,940
If Your Majesty thinks...
it is old fashioned...

433
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:54,443
to make the rain and
the wind with a stranger...

434
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,361
we can be like a modern
couple... to begin with

435
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:00,239
A modern couple?

436
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:05,244
Goodnight! Goodnight!

437
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,590
You must come to Oxford with me

438
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:25,223
I like him

439
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:29,267
I am sure I am going to like him

440
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,269
And he will grow up

441
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:36,691
Eyes down

442
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,699
Report your arrival

443
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,244
Prisoner 981 reporting

444
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,328
Louder!

445
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,580
Prisoner 981 reporting!

446
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,374
Open the door

447
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:00,755
Close the door

448
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,259
Sit down

449
01:11:10,807 --> 01:11:11,891
Name?

450
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:13,893
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

451
01:11:13,977 --> 01:11:15,395
Write it

452
01:11:35,664 --> 01:11:40,252
Now then... there are two types of confession

453
01:11:40,878 --> 01:11:43,505
We call them toothpaste...

454
01:11:43,672 --> 01:11:45,090
and water tap

455
01:11:45,549 --> 01:11:49,928
The toothpaste prisoner needs to
be squeezed every now and then...

456
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:52,347
or else he forgets to keep confessing

457
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:58,769
The water tap man... needs one good
hard twist before he starts...

458
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,313
but then everything comes out

459
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:05,525
Now... you're an intelligent person

460
01:12:05,734 --> 01:12:08,111
I'm sure you understand me?

461
01:12:08,987 --> 01:12:12,324
Good. Then we'll begin

462
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,745
Why do you think you're in here 981?

463
01:12:17,162 --> 01:12:19,206
I am accused of being a traitor...

464
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:22,292
a collaborator and a counter revolutionary

465
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:25,295
It is not an accusation! You are a traitor!

466
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:30,008
You are a collaborator and you
are a counter revolutionary

467
01:12:36,013 --> 01:12:37,598
Did you write this?

468
01:12:38,432 --> 01:12:40,309
And you call it a confession?

469
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:42,853
This is nothing but a list of dates

470
01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:44,688
A child's fairy tale

471
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:57,492
What do you want me to confess?

472
01:12:57,575 --> 01:12:59,035
You know what you did...

473
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,912
and what others did

474
01:13:00,995 --> 01:13:03,247
So why don't you volunteer the information?

475
01:13:03,372 --> 01:13:04,915
I do not understand

476
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:08,001
We don't tell people what to confess

477
01:13:08,126 --> 01:13:10,337
We already know everything about you

478
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,431
I...

479
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:25,978
I wanted reforms

480
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:29,356
What did you want to... reform?

481
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:31,775
Everything

482
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,111
Cut off my queue

483
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:38,948
Your Majesty, please

484
01:14:13,814 --> 01:14:15,274
It is heavy

485
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:17,610
The Emperor before me was murdered...

486
01:14:17,735 --> 01:14:20,863
because he wanted to reform the Empire

487
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,907
Is that no so, Mr Johnston?

488
01:14:23,032 --> 01:14:25,826
Yes, Your Majesty... probably

489
01:14:28,412 --> 01:14:33,042
Well... let's see if they will kill me
for reforming the Forbidden City

490
01:14:34,668 --> 01:14:37,378
I am appointing Mr Johnston's friend...

491
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:41,382
the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao-Hsiu
...to be the new Lord Chamberlain

492
01:14:41,799 --> 01:14:46,554
I want him to supervise a detailed
inventory... of the lmperial storerooms

493
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:51,267
So that we can learn exactly
how much has been stolen

494
01:14:51,476 --> 01:14:51,476
29.970

495
01:15:01,485 --> 01:15:05,572
The Forbidden City had become
a theatre without an audience

496
01:15:06,114 --> 01:15:09,408
So why did the actors remain on the stage?

497
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:16,499
It was only to steal the
scenery... piece by piece

498
01:15:29,036 --> 01:15:33,040
Can I sleep here? I am frightened

499
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:51,382
You're brave

500
01:15:51,674 --> 01:15:53,175
Are you not frightened?

501
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,718
I am excited

502
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:57,971
I do not want to escape anymore

503
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,556
I want to rule

504
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:06,435
Kiss me

505
01:16:37,752 --> 01:16:40,880
Can I stay with you as well?

506
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:44,883
Get in. Get in

507
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:08,986
I used to play a game with the Eunuchs...

508
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,824
trying to guess who is who

509
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:19,243
Now I cannot see you

510
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:25,179
The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty

511
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,736
The fire was a terrible disaster

512
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,322
And I knew that Eunuchs had started it...

513
01:19:45,488 --> 01:19:47,573
to stop me from knowing what they had stolen

514
01:19:47,948 --> 01:19:51,701
There had been Eunuchs in the
Forbidden City... for eight hundred years

515
01:19:51,868 --> 01:19:54,578
There were still more
than a thousand of them

516
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:56,622
I decided to expel them all

517
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,417
I had to ask for
Republican troops to help me

518
01:21:04,344 --> 01:21:05,720
What are they carrying?

519
01:21:07,179 --> 01:21:09,097
Their organs

520
01:21:09,472 --> 01:21:11,182
Whatever their crimes...

521
01:21:11,307 --> 01:21:15,936
they cannot be deprived of the
right... to be buried as whole men

522
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:20,071
I... I forgot what I was saying

523
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:21,990
You're wasting our time

524
01:22:22,073 --> 01:22:24,824
We want to know about the Japanese

525
01:22:25,783 --> 01:22:28,369
How did your friendship
with the Japanese begin?

526
01:22:28,494 --> 01:22:30,496
Who introduced you? When?

527
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:37,920
I think it was... it was 1924

528
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,339
Parliament had been dissolved again

529
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:41,672
The President had fled

530
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:49,387
At first I thought it was just another
...coup d'etat by just another warlord

531
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:53,266
Only this time it was different

532
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:56,893
This time it was my turn

533
01:22:58,311 --> 01:23:00,270
Fifteen love

534
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,499
Play

535
01:23:30,504 --> 01:23:33,631
Thirty-fifteen

536
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,533
The rotten Government of
the Republic is in flight

537
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,411
Now we shall remove the foreign stench...

538
01:24:09,536 --> 01:24:13,330
of the Manchurian rats who still
hide in the Forbidden City

539
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:26,258
Mr Pu Yi and his family...

540
01:24:26,383 --> 01:24:30,135
have been given one hour
to leave the Forbidden City

541
01:24:31,887 --> 01:24:36,098
They will be escorted... to the
home of his Father and remain...

542
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:39,476
there under guard as state prisoners...

543
01:24:39,643 --> 01:24:41,853
until further notice

544
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:49,943
What are you all looking at?

545
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:52,278
What are you standing there for?

546
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:54,280
You always wanted to
leave the Forbidden City

547
01:24:54,697 --> 01:24:56,240
Now you have got an hour to pack

548
01:24:56,365 --> 01:25:00,203
So go

549
01:25:13,212 --> 01:25:16,256
I always thought I hated it here

550
01:25:16,882 --> 01:25:19,175
But now I am afraid to leave

551
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:20,801
Do you think they will kill me?

552
01:25:20,885 --> 01:25:23,221
You must do as they say, Your Majesty...

553
01:25:23,346 --> 01:25:25,430
while I try to reach the British Embassy

554
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:27,474
They will give you asylum there

555
01:25:28,975 --> 01:25:30,351
I'm sure they will

556
01:25:31,851 --> 01:25:35,730
Chang... take my car to the South gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty

557
01:27:27,446 --> 01:27:28,530
Please, Your Majesty

558
01:27:28,614 --> 01:27:30,240
What?

559
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:19,894
But you didn't go to the
British Embassy, did you?

560
01:28:20,186 --> 01:28:22,230
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy

561
01:28:22,313 --> 01:28:25,107
The Japanese were the only people
prepared to help me

562
01:28:25,274 --> 01:28:26,817
Help you for nothing?

563
01:28:28,986 --> 01:28:32,490
Japan has an Emperor.
We are almost the same age

564
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,201
I thought it was kindness

565
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:39,120
The same time I relised that
for many Chinese...

566
01:28:39,287 --> 01:28:40,830
I was an alien

567
01:28:40,956 --> 01:28:43,458
Simply because I am Manchurian

568
01:28:44,209 --> 01:28:49,130
There was even an Anti-Manchurian
League who wanted to assassinate me

569
01:28:49,506 --> 01:28:52,926
So I went to live in Tientsin

570
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:59,057
It was a nice... provincial town
...with a big port

571
01:28:59,307 --> 01:29:03,311
In those days it had a large
International Settlement

572
01:29:03,478 --> 01:29:05,772
The Japanese thought it
would be safer for me there

573
01:29:05,897 --> 01:29:08,483
Were the Japanese paying
for you in Tientsin?

574
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:12,486
Oh, no. I had to rent a villa

575
01:29:12,653 --> 01:29:16,823
The villa Chang... and it was very expensive

576
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:19,784
So, were the bodyguards

577
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:21,953
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin

578
01:29:22,078 --> 01:29:26,082
Did you still believe in the
restoration of the lmperial system

579
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:27,500
Others did

580
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:29,878
The little court-in-exile

581
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,716
I cannot remember how much
jade and jewellery...

582
01:29:34,924 --> 01:29:36,968
they made me spend to buy the
friendship of some warlord...

583
01:29:37,093 --> 01:29:39,596
or some... white Russian general

584
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:41,471
And what else did you spend your money on?

585
01:29:41,555 --> 01:29:44,099
Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos...

586
01:29:44,224 --> 01:29:46,435
watches, radios

587
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,562
As long as they were foreign

588
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:52,691
Of course. Anything Western was good

589
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,861
Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,
Bayer aspirin...

590
01:29:56,028 --> 01:29:57,070
and cars

591
01:29:57,154 --> 01:29:58,989
While you were in Tientsin...

592
01:29:59,531 --> 01:30:03,285
most of China came under the control
of General Chiang Kai Shek...

593
01:30:03,493 --> 01:30:07,372
the so-called Nationalists... the Kuomintang

594
01:30:07,873 --> 01:30:10,000
What were your relations with them?

595
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:12,418
None

596
01:30:13,252 --> 01:30:16,255
I felt useless in Tientsin

597
01:30:16,671 --> 01:30:18,256
I was twenty-one

598
01:30:19,299 --> 01:30:22,177
I dreamt of going to the West

599
01:30:23,386 --> 01:30:25,096
I became a playboy

600
01:31:22,025 --> 01:31:25,070
Tientsin, 1927

601
01:31:58,311 --> 01:31:59,896
BRITISH INDIA STEAM NAVIGATION COMPAN

602
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:12,658
That's a great ship...
if you're going first class

603
01:32:14,994 --> 01:32:17,204
I'm not going anywhere

604
01:32:21,582 --> 01:32:23,542
Would you like to dance?

605
01:32:32,468 --> 01:32:33,802
You are a brave man

606
01:32:33,886 --> 01:32:35,554
Nobody here would have danced with me

607
01:32:36,096 --> 01:32:37,181
Why's that?

608
01:32:39,141 --> 01:32:40,643
Because I am Chinese

609
01:32:41,602 --> 01:32:43,103
Well... I'm American

610
01:32:54,155 --> 01:32:55,406
You say California.

611
01:32:55,782 --> 01:32:57,367
I say French Riviera

612
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:58,743
San Fransisco

613
01:32:59,244 --> 01:33:00,411
Monte Carlo

614
01:33:01,788 --> 01:33:04,666
Are we really going this time?

615
01:33:13,633 --> 01:33:14,968
Who's that couple?

616
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:17,220
Oh, Henry and Elizabeth

617
01:33:18,804 --> 01:33:20,012
The Emperor of China?

618
01:33:20,429 --> 01:33:22,306
The ex-Emperor and his wife

619
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:26,018
She's beautiful

620
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,812
Yes, very

621
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:29,272
And who are you?

622
01:33:30,106 --> 01:33:32,024
I am His Highness' other wife

623
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:33,526
His other wife?

624
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,236
Number two wife

625
01:33:36,988 --> 01:33:38,990
Well, some people have all the luck

626
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,340
Ladies and Gentlemen

627
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:04,222
General Chiang Kai Shek... has taken Shanghai

628
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:08,185
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds

629
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,561
and they've knocked them for six

630
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:13,064
The Reds are finished!

631
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,113
Sorry about the reception everyone.
We'll have it fixed in a minute

632
01:34:21,112 --> 01:34:24,908
It would be wiser to return to the
Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty

633
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:26,409
Your car is waiting

634
01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:28,411
Thank you, Mr Amakasu

635
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:45,345
The General strike in Shanghai has collapsed

636
01:34:46,513 --> 01:34:49,557
The International Settlement is safe

637
01:34:50,266 --> 01:34:54,853
Troops of the Kuomintang are now
in fall control of the city

638
01:34:55,062 --> 01:35:00,150
And firm steps are being taken to
restore order... in the native areas

639
01:35:09,701 --> 01:35:12,746
Wen Hsiu. You want some gum?

640
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:18,877
I want a divorce

641
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:27,884
I do not want to be your mistress any longer

642
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:30,470
I thought you were my Secondary Consort

643
01:35:30,554 --> 01:35:32,764
In the Forbidden City you were the Emperor...

644
01:35:32,889 --> 01:35:35,016
and I was a Secondary Consort

645
01:35:36,142 --> 01:35:38,603
But now your are Henry Pu Yi...

646
01:35:38,895 --> 01:35:41,731
Wan Jung is your wife, Elizabeth

647
01:35:43,608 --> 01:35:46,069
And who am I?

648
01:35:46,987 --> 01:35:49,823
I'm nobody

649
01:35:58,664 --> 01:36:01,417
I did not know you were so unhappy

650
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:09,800
You can only have one wife in the West

651
01:36:14,972 --> 01:36:16,932
I want a divorce

652
01:36:17,308 --> 01:36:20,186
No one can divorce me

653
01:36:43,749 --> 01:36:45,792
I want a divorce

654
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:28,165
Your Ladyship

655
01:37:48,769 --> 01:37:50,521
I do not need it

656
01:37:55,067 --> 01:37:57,820
I do not need it

657
01:38:39,358 --> 01:38:41,527
Can I come in?

658
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:44,155
Don't you remember me?

659
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:46,908
I'm dressed like a pilot,
but I still can't fly

660
01:38:47,325 --> 01:38:48,451
Not yet

661
01:38:48,534 --> 01:38:51,078
Eastern Jewel. We had dancing classes together

662
01:38:51,537 --> 01:38:53,372
Yes, just before your marriage

663
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,876
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?

664
01:38:57,418 --> 01:38:58,836
Wen Hsiu has gone

665
01:39:00,296 --> 01:39:01,922
She will never come back

666
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,216
Is that so bad?

667
01:39:05,133 --> 01:39:07,010
She was my only friend

668
01:39:08,762 --> 01:39:12,057
Well, at least now you've got
a husband all to yourself'

669
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,519
And you've got me

670
01:39:17,312 --> 01:39:19,606
I'll be your friend

671
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,024
You smoke opium?

672
01:39:21,107 --> 01:39:23,777
Be wicked. It's the best in Shanghai

673
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:27,321
Why are you going to Europe?

674
01:39:27,446 --> 01:39:29,031
The place to go is Japan

675
01:39:29,156 --> 01:39:30,991
It's more fun than anywhere

676
01:39:32,243 --> 01:39:33,952
It's modern

677
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:37,247
How do you know we are going to Europe?

678
01:39:37,372 --> 01:39:38,706
It is a secret

679
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,834
Oh, I know everything

680
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:45,088
I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth

681
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:48,258
I even know his nickname, Cash-my-check

682
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,722
I'm a spy

683
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:56,808
And I don't care who knows it

684
01:39:57,183 --> 01:39:58,393
A spy?

685
01:39:58,476 --> 01:40:00,603
I work for the Japanese
Special Service Bureau...

686
01:40:01,062 --> 01:40:03,106
and I've come to protect you

687
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:06,191
The Japanese?

688
01:40:07,276 --> 01:40:09,987
They are getting closer to him every day

689
01:40:11,321 --> 01:40:15,450
He is sending his brother...
to the Military Academy in Tokyo

690
01:40:15,784 --> 01:40:18,662
They talk to him about
Manchuria all the time

691
01:40:20,164 --> 01:40:23,750
And Mr Amakasu never says hello to me

692
01:40:23,959 --> 01:40:25,711
I do not trust the Japanese

693
01:40:36,928 --> 01:40:39,598
Of course, I'd love to be the
Emperor's new Secondary Consort

694
01:40:39,764 --> 01:40:41,224
Eastern Jewel

695
01:40:41,475 --> 01:40:43,852
If the past available

696
01:41:01,828 --> 01:41:04,498
The post is vacant, my dear cousin...

697
01:41:06,749 --> 01:41:09,668
but you do not fit the part

698
01:41:12,129 --> 01:41:14,548
Wen Hsiu left her dog behind.
Do you want it?

699
01:41:17,343 --> 01:41:21,805
It is my fault. It is all my fault

700
01:41:54,127 --> 01:41:56,547
I came to see you, Your Majesty...

701
01:41:57,339 --> 01:41:59,800
to give you bad news

702
01:42:00,259 --> 01:42:02,261
Something terrible has happened

703
01:42:08,225 --> 01:42:14,355
The lmperial tombs of our Manchurian
ancestors have been attacked...

704
01:42:14,772 --> 01:42:16,774
and robbed... by troops of the Kuomintang

705
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:18,776
Chinese soldiers

706
01:42:19,402 --> 01:42:22,905
A warlord working for Chiang Kai Shek

707
01:42:25,533 --> 01:42:31,663
The body of the Empress Dowager...
was hacked to pieces

708
01:42:32,956 --> 01:42:35,709
Her pearl necklace has
became a wedding present

709
01:42:35,876 --> 01:42:40,379
from Chiang Kai Shek... to his new wife

710
01:43:01,275 --> 01:43:02,693
Tell me 981...

711
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:04,403
do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

712
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:05,446
Of course

713
01:43:05,821 --> 01:43:06,655
What is this?

714
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:07,948
Japan

715
01:43:08,115 --> 01:43:09,742
And what do you call this part of China

716
01:43:09,867 --> 01:43:10,951
The North East

717
01:43:11,034 --> 01:43:12,410
And what did you call it as a child?

718
01:43:12,535 --> 01:43:14,078
Manchuria

719
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:16,998
Japan invaded Manchuria

720
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:18,458
on September 18th, 1931

721
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:21,294
And began to set up a puppet
state called Manchukuo

722
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:24,339
Shorty afterwards, a Japanese Delegation...

723
01:43:24,506 --> 01:43:26,007
paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

724
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,425
to request your collaboration

725
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,177
Which you say you refused?

726
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:30,845
Speak up

727
01:43:31,136 --> 01:43:33,597
I already told you.
I have told you a hundred times

728
01:43:33,722 --> 01:43:35,599
Tell us again. Tell us two hundred times

729
01:43:35,724 --> 01:43:37,476
I refused to collaborate

730
01:43:37,893 --> 01:43:40,145
You say you refused, but a month later...

731
01:43:40,562 --> 01:43:42,730
on November 10th, 1931...

732
01:43:43,147 --> 01:43:45,650
there you are arriving in Manchuria...

733
01:43:45,775 --> 01:43:47,777
or shall I call it Manchukuo?

734
01:43:48,236 --> 01:43:50,613
Now, according to this
so-called confession of yours...

735
01:43:50,738 --> 01:43:52,448
you didn't go of your own free will

736
01:43:52,573 --> 01:43:54,909
You insisted you were
kidnapped... by the Japanese

737
01:43:55,034 --> 01:43:56,160
Yes

738
01:43:56,244 --> 01:43:57,370
And taken to Manchuria by force?

739
01:43:57,453 --> 01:43:58,621
Yes

740
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,414
Sit down

741
01:44:03,125 --> 01:44:07,129
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?

742
01:44:08,339 --> 01:44:09,674
He was your tutor

743
01:44:10,842 --> 01:44:11,884
Yes

744
01:44:12,927 --> 01:44:15,512
And a good friend... I believe

745
01:44:17,264 --> 01:44:20,308
After twenty-eight years in China...

746
01:44:20,475 --> 01:44:22,435
Mr Johnston returned to England

747
01:44:23,145 --> 01:44:29,025
He became a Professor of Oriental
Studies... at London University

748
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,570
And he wrote a book

749
01:44:31,695 --> 01:44:35,447
It is calledTwilight
in the Forbidden City

750
01:44:35,656 --> 01:44:38,242
And it is dedicated to you

751
01:44:42,371 --> 01:44:45,748
Tientsin, 1931

752
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:07,896
I am going to miss you, Johnston

753
01:45:08,021 --> 01:45:10,023
I shall miss you, Your Majesty

754
01:45:14,235 --> 01:45:18,655
Do you think a man...
can become Emperor again?

755
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:21,617
Yes

756
01:45:39,008 --> 01:45:41,677
Thank you, Your Majesty

757
01:45:47,224 --> 01:45:49,267
How can we say goodbye?

758
01:45:50,894 --> 01:45:54,606
As we said hello

759
01:46:05,242 --> 01:46:07,285
Farewell, Mr Johnston

760
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:10,622
Farewell, Your Majesty

761
01:46:57,249 --> 01:46:59,126
Goodbye, Mr Johnston

762
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:01,712
We'll never forget you, Mr Johnston

763
01:47:02,296 --> 01:47:07,551
Mr Johnston, goodbye, goodbye

764
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:16,101
On page 449...

765
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:18,604
Mr Johnston writes...

766
01:47:18,729 --> 01:47:23,858
the endeavour to make out that
the Emperor had been kidnapped...

767
01:47:24,108 --> 01:47:26,194
by the Japanese... is wholly untrue

768
01:47:27,195 --> 01:47:31,115
He left Tientsin... he went to
Manchuria of his own free will...

769
01:47:31,282 --> 01:47:33,367
Johnston was a liar

770
01:47:33,784 --> 01:47:35,036
What did you say?

771
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:39,414
Mr Johnston had left before
I was taken to Manchuria

772
01:47:39,998 --> 01:47:43,293
He could not have known what happened

773
01:47:58,474 --> 01:48:00,434
Sit down

774
01:48:07,274 --> 01:48:08,442
According to this account...

775
01:48:08,526 --> 01:48:11,695
you prepared the man's things
on the morning of November 9th

776
01:48:11,862 --> 01:48:15,115
Isn't it unusual for a man who is
kidnapped to have his luggage packed...

777
01:48:15,282 --> 01:48:17,409
by his valet the day before he's kidnapped

778
01:48:17,785 --> 01:48:19,078
This is what you've written isn't it?

779
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:21,914
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

780
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:26,876
These two stories don't fit

781
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,878
Do they?

782
01:48:29,462 --> 01:48:31,589
It was a long time ago

783
01:48:32,132 --> 01:48:34,425
Perhaps I made a mistake

784
01:48:34,551 --> 01:48:35,635
You are lying

785
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:37,886
You are both lying

786
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:39,930
Control yourself

787
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,188
You can still change your mind

788
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:58,197
I am the hereditary ruler
of the Manchukuo people

789
01:49:00,741 --> 01:49:04,537
There can be no Manchukuo without me

790
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:08,833
Do you not see? The Japanese are using you

791
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:12,086
I must try to use them

792
01:49:12,253 --> 01:49:14,505
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria...

793
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:16,591
will be condemned by
the League of Nations...

794
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:18,634
and by every civilised country on Earth

795
01:49:18,759 --> 01:49:22,138
The Chinese Republic has broken
every promise it ever made to me

796
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:25,557
Chinese troops desecrated
the tombs of my ancestors

797
01:49:25,932 --> 01:49:29,227
And Chinese troops did not
defend Manchuria from the Japanese

798
01:49:29,436 --> 01:49:31,646
But Manchuria is still China

799
01:49:32,022 --> 01:49:34,024
China has turned its back on me

800
01:49:34,107 --> 01:49:35,692
Please do not go

801
01:49:36,109 --> 01:49:38,986
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia

802
01:49:39,278 --> 01:49:41,655
Coal, oil, railways

803
01:49:41,947 --> 01:49:45,326
Millions of Chinese emigrants
are going there every year

804
01:49:45,785 --> 01:49:47,328
I'm going to build my country

805
01:49:47,745 --> 01:49:49,955
Johnston was wrong but he wasn't a liar

806
01:49:50,623 --> 01:49:52,541
There was no kidnapping

807
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:55,252
You went to Manchuria by your own choice

808
01:49:55,377 --> 01:49:57,295
because you wanted to be Emperor again

809
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:17,899
These might help you to remember the truth

810
01:50:33,288 --> 01:50:36,792
Manchuria 1934

811
01:51:56,034 --> 01:51:58,036
To Heaven

812
01:52:05,083 --> 01:52:07,169
To Earth

813
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:09,713
To the Moon

814
01:52:12,382 --> 01:52:14,927
To the Sun

815
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:33,611
You're an Empress again

816
01:52:35,029 --> 01:52:37,198
What I'm going to be is a pilot

817
01:52:37,615 --> 01:52:39,617
I'm going to train at
a secret base near Yokohama

818
01:52:39,742 --> 01:52:41,451
To learn precision bombing

819
01:52:43,245 --> 01:52:45,956
I want to bomb Shanghai

820
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:48,583
Bomb Shanghai?

821
01:52:49,042 --> 01:52:50,794
I hate China

822
01:52:57,175 --> 01:52:59,594
I hate you

823
01:54:19,295 --> 01:54:21,005
The Japanese Army High Command

824
01:54:21,422 --> 01:54:23,341
Very impressive

825
01:54:56,413 --> 01:55:00,835
On behalf of the Emperor of Japan...
the Commander of the Kwangtung Army...

826
01:55:01,085 --> 01:55:07,424
extends his warmest congratulations on
the occasion of His Majesty's coronation

827
01:57:03,076 --> 01:57:08,248
Ah, may I introduce you...
my wife, the Princess Hiro Saga

828
01:57:08,706 --> 01:57:12,293
Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu

829
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:19,842
The Honourable Chang Ching-Hui...
Minister of Defense

830
01:57:20,676 --> 01:57:23,887
The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna

831
01:57:38,861 --> 01:57:42,614
The Empress and I accept with great pleasure

832
01:57:49,453 --> 01:57:51,163
Excuse me, Gentlemen

833
01:58:14,352 --> 01:58:17,897
Ah, and our Mr Amakasu...

834
01:58:18,105 --> 01:58:22,777
is the new chief of the
Manchurian Motion Picture Studios

835
01:58:31,702 --> 01:58:34,663
Do you have to spoil this day?

836
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:36,123
Why?

837
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:43,297
Mr Amakasu is the most
powerful man in Manchukuo

838
01:58:43,547 --> 01:58:45,132
What are you talking about?

839
01:58:46,633 --> 01:58:50,511
You did not believe I could
be Emperor again. But I am

840
01:58:51,053 --> 01:58:53,305
You are blind

841
01:59:03,023 --> 01:59:06,777
Do you know what it means to be
an Empress? You are an Empress

842
01:59:10,906 --> 01:59:13,200
Why do you not make love to me anymore?

843
01:59:13,325 --> 01:59:15,828
Because you have become an opium addict

844
01:59:16,203 --> 01:59:17,995
Opium killed my Mother

845
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:20,331
Opium destroyed China

846
01:59:20,706 --> 01:59:22,750
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo

847
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:23,835
Shut up

848
01:59:23,918 --> 01:59:24,669
In any shop

849
01:59:24,752 --> 01:59:26,003
Shut up

850
01:59:29,757 --> 01:59:32,844
Your brother is going to have a child

851
01:59:35,012 --> 01:59:37,723
We must have a child

852
01:59:38,224 --> 01:59:41,352
You must have an heir

853
01:59:41,894 --> 01:59:46,691
Emperor Hirohito has officially
invited us to Japan

854
01:59:47,191 --> 01:59:48,983
I am going alone

855
01:59:49,525 --> 01:59:51,485
You are staying here

856
01:59:52,278 --> 01:59:53,904
I would never go to Japan

857
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:56,157
Then go to your room

858
02:00:03,372 --> 02:00:06,834
Ten thousand years to His Majesty the Emperor

859
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:33,777
Ten thousand years

860
02:01:19,821 --> 02:01:23,031
I told you I hate you

861
02:01:25,575 --> 02:01:29,579
Only because I give you what you need

862
02:02:03,278 --> 02:02:05,697
Now we're engaged

863
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:03,043
You forgot my toothpowder

864
02:03:03,919 --> 02:03:06,213
Yes, sir

865
02:03:25,148 --> 02:03:26,149
Move him

866
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:33,697
981. Collect your things

867
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:45,167
Up stairs

868
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:50,798
Stop

869
02:03:59,388 --> 02:04:02,182
Your laces are undone. Do them up

870
02:04:02,307 --> 02:04:03,684
Thursday you serve lunch

871
02:04:03,809 --> 02:04:05,519
Friday you clean the toilet

872
02:04:05,644 --> 02:04:08,147
Saturday you sweep the floor

873
02:04:35,798 --> 02:04:38,426
I have never been separated from my family

874
02:04:38,593 --> 02:04:40,595
You'd better get use to it

875
02:04:46,392 --> 02:04:48,269
You do not remember me, do you?

876
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:53,399
I was the Minister of Trade... in Manchukuo

877
02:04:56,485 --> 02:04:58,695
You were all in Manchukuo

878
02:04:59,946 --> 02:05:02,198
Now I am the Cell Leader

879
02:05:02,323 --> 02:05:04,492
It is important to follow the rules here

880
02:05:04,867 --> 02:05:07,870
No talking during study sessions

881
02:05:30,184 --> 02:05:33,520
MANCHURIA 1935

882
02:06:00,087 --> 02:06:01,880
Where is your gun, Captain?

883
02:06:02,256 --> 02:06:03,589
Where are their swords?

884
02:06:03,923 --> 02:06:06,426
Our weapons have been removed, Your Majesty

885
02:06:06,551 --> 02:06:08,970
On the orders of Colonel Yoshioka?

886
02:06:09,387 --> 02:06:11,639
Colonel Yoshioka?

887
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,976
Colonel Yoshioka

888
02:06:15,101 --> 02:06:16,310
What has happened here?

889
02:06:16,686 --> 02:06:18,604
Why has my Guard been disarmed?

890
02:06:18,729 --> 02:06:24,694
There have been many changes
while you were in Tokyo

891
02:06:24,986 --> 02:06:28,156
Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa...

892
02:06:28,322 --> 02:06:31,784
the new Japanese Ambassador... to Manchukuo

893
02:06:58,017 --> 02:07:01,020
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao-Hsiu
not here to receive me?

894
02:07:01,145 --> 02:07:03,939
The Prime Minister has
resigned, Your Majesty

895
02:07:04,482 --> 02:07:06,733
His son his been assassinated

896
02:07:07,192 --> 02:07:08,902
Assassinated?

897
02:07:09,027 --> 02:07:12,739
By Communist bandits, Your Majesty

898
02:07:18,703 --> 02:07:20,914
I must see him at once

899
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:23,833
He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty

900
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,047
He has gone to a monastery... far away

901
02:07:36,096 --> 02:07:37,721
Who are you?

902
02:07:38,388 --> 02:07:41,016
Chang Ching Hui, Your Majesty

903
02:07:41,141 --> 02:07:43,685
Minister of Defence

904
02:07:52,236 --> 02:07:55,697
The Council Meeting will be at
four o'clock, Your Majesty...

905
02:07:55,906 --> 02:07:58,032
before the State dinner

906
02:08:08,708 --> 02:08:12,712
The Emperor has been asked
to sign the following

907
02:08:13,463 --> 02:08:19,136
After careful consideration
we have decided...

908
02:08:19,386 --> 02:08:22,848
to nominate the honourable Chang Ching Hui
as the new Prime Minister of Manchukuo

909
02:08:28,979 --> 02:08:32,107
Today, on the our return from Japan...

910
02:08:32,274 --> 02:08:35,652
we wish to speak of
something more important...

911
02:08:36,069 --> 02:08:39,238
the future of our friendship with Japan

912
02:08:40,364 --> 02:08:43,534
This is based on mutual respect...

913
02:08:43,993 --> 02:08:48,038
and respect means equality and independence

914
02:08:48,497 --> 02:08:50,666
When the two Emperors stood together...

915
02:08:50,791 --> 02:08:53,127
and saluted the two national flags

916
02:08:53,252 --> 02:08:56,464
they recognised that
Manchukuo had come of age

917
02:08:56,630 --> 02:09:00,592
Manchukuo is not a colony,
Manchukuo is Manchuria

918
02:09:04,053 --> 02:09:06,556
The relationship between
our two countries...

919
02:09:06,723 --> 02:09:09,559
is like the relationship
between its two Emperors

920
02:09:09,933 --> 02:09:14,897
It is rooted in fraternal
trust... in... in the desire

921
02:09:15,147 --> 02:09:17,816
to preserve our ancient traditions...

922
02:09:18,275 --> 02:09:21,987
and in a mutual respect
for national identities

923
02:09:23,363 --> 02:09:27,159
Already we have welcomed the
Ambassadors... of E I Salvador

924
02:09:27,367 --> 02:09:29,453
Costa Rica, the Vatican

925
02:09:32,331 --> 02:09:36,543
Soon, I'm... I'm sure the
other countries will follow

926
02:09:54,894 --> 02:09:57,563
I am going to have a child

927
02:10:01,525 --> 02:10:04,778
The Father is Manchurian

928
02:10:11,618 --> 02:10:14,537
I did it for you

929
02:10:35,558 --> 02:10:37,268
His Majesty forgot to
sign the appointment of

930
02:10:37,393 --> 02:10:40,896
the new Prime Minister... Mr Chang Ching Hui

931
02:10:43,398 --> 02:10:45,150
I did not forget

932
02:10:51,406 --> 02:10:55,535
When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty, he becomes a gentleman

933
02:10:56,035 --> 02:10:58,955
If he robs a lot he becomes a knight

934
02:10:59,748 --> 02:11:03,792
Do you imagine the British run
their empire as a charity?

935
02:11:04,293 --> 02:11:08,714
If India has payed for the
cost of its own occupation...

936
02:11:08,922 --> 02:11:11,967
so must Manchukuo

937
02:11:25,188 --> 02:11:29,442
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir

938
02:11:30,985 --> 02:11:33,112
The Empress is expecting a child

939
02:11:33,488 --> 02:11:36,574
Yes, Your Majesty... we are
aware of the situation

940
02:11:42,955 --> 02:11:45,291
This is the name of the
Father. His name is Chang

941
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:59,262
He is your driver

942
02:12:17,987 --> 02:12:20,657
All the necessary facts have been recorded

943
02:12:20,824 --> 02:12:22,909
The man will be punished

944
02:12:23,493 --> 02:12:27,038
The Emperor cannot allow
his honour to be stained

945
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:48,100
The Japanese are the only
divine race on our earth

946
02:12:48,308 --> 02:12:55,190
We will take China, Hong Kong...
Indo-China, Siam, Malaya

947
02:12:55,524 --> 02:12:58,527
Singapore and India

948
02:12:58,694 --> 02:13:01,697
Asia belongs to us

949
02:13:32,642 --> 02:13:35,604
There have been complaints
from your cell mates

950
02:13:35,729 --> 02:13:39,983
You must learn how to urinate at night
without walking them all up

951
02:13:41,985 --> 02:13:43,945
The way to do it...

952
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:46,948
is to urinate against
the side of the bucket...

953
02:13:47,074 --> 02:13:49,284
not into the middle

954
02:13:49,409 --> 02:13:51,202
Yes, comrade

955
02:14:05,298 --> 02:14:08,551
You still think I'm your servant, don't you?

956
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:33,617
You are all pretending

957
02:14:33,742 --> 02:14:35,744
You are just pretending you have changed

958
02:14:35,869 --> 02:14:38,539
The party it teach us to be new men

959
02:14:38,705 --> 02:14:40,666
We are working for a new China

960
02:14:40,958 --> 02:14:43,085
You worked in Amakasu's private office

961
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:44,795
You are still the same people

962
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,922
People do not change

963
02:14:47,256 --> 02:14:50,926
Guard!

964
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:04,105
I let it happen

965
02:15:39,847 --> 02:15:41,891
The second edict, Your Majesty

966
02:15:42,308 --> 02:15:47,146
Japanese will be the official
language in Manchukuo schools

967
02:15:59,365 --> 02:16:00,909
Your Majesty...

968
02:16:05,497 --> 02:16:07,873
The baby was born dead, Your Majesty

969
02:16:08,207 --> 02:16:09,458
How is the Empress?

970
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:13,879
It would be better if she goes
to a clinic... somewhere warm

971
02:16:16,507 --> 02:16:18,926
She's already left, Your Majesty

972
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:15,896
Open the door

973
02:18:12,992 --> 02:18:15,953
With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...

974
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:19,332
the Japanese soon controlled
most of North China

975
02:18:19,832 --> 02:18:23,127
By 1937 they were ready to strike
South at the heart of the country

976
02:18:23,336 --> 02:18:25,129
The attack on Shanghai
was one of the first...

977
02:18:25,922 --> 02:18:30,884
civilian bombing raids in history

978
02:18:31,468 --> 02:18:33,804
It left thousands homeless

979
02:18:33,929 --> 02:18:35,680
Thousands dead

980
02:18:41,019 --> 02:18:43,021
Three months later Japanese armies...

981
02:18:43,146 --> 02:18:46,316
were besieging the provisional
capital... at Nanking...

982
02:18:46,858 --> 02:18:51,113
and when the city fell
...the atrocities began

983
02:18:51,863 --> 02:18:56,034
Trying to terrorise the rest
of China into surrender

984
02:18:56,243 --> 02:18:59,079
The Japanese high command ordered a massacre

985
02:18:59,246 --> 02:19:04,542
More than two hundred thousand civilians
were systematically executed

986
02:19:04,917 --> 02:19:07,294
The world watched in horror...

987
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,714
but no help was given

988
02:19:10,131 --> 02:19:12,507
On December 7th 1941...

989
02:19:13,007 --> 02:19:15,760
Japan attacked the American fleet...

990
02:19:15,885 --> 02:19:17,262
at Pearl Harbour

991
02:19:17,387 --> 02:19:19,764
There was no warning

992
02:19:20,098 --> 02:19:23,893
Manchukuo... the Japanese bustion in North China...

993
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:28,732
was still ruled by the puppet Emperor Pu Yi

994
02:19:29,274 --> 02:19:32,235
But behind the facade of triumph...

995
02:19:32,402 --> 02:19:34,903
was a country enslaved

996
02:19:35,696 --> 02:19:39,450
A country where Japanese experiments
in biological warfare...

997
02:19:39,616 --> 02:19:43,579
were carried out on live human beings

998
02:19:44,329 --> 02:19:50,085
A country where opium production became
the easiest way to finance the war

999
02:19:50,586 --> 02:19:55,257
Millions of people... were deliberately
turned into drug addicts

1000
02:20:20,906 --> 02:20:25,452
Nine days after the bomb...

1001
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:27,954
at Hiroshima on August 15th 1945...

1002
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:32,459
Emperor Hirohito... announced
the surrender of Japan

1003
02:20:32,793 --> 02:20:37,129
It was the first time... his voice
had ever been heard... on radio

1004
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:24,216
You must get to Tokoy, Your Majesty

1005
02:21:24,341 --> 02:21:26,427
You must surrender to the Americans
not the Russians

1006
02:21:26,885 --> 02:21:29,263
The Communists will kill everyone

1007
02:22:14,555 --> 02:22:17,349
The Empress has returned

1008
02:22:25,608 --> 02:22:27,735
Your Majesty, please

1009
02:22:32,156 --> 02:22:33,741
Your Majesty

1010
02:23:26,874 --> 02:23:32,922
The women are not in danger. We must hurry

1011
02:24:29,809 --> 02:24:35,357
Your Majesty, your Majesty is leaving now

1012
02:25:10,683 --> 02:25:12,893
The Russians

1013
02:25:51,053 --> 02:25:54,849
Perhaps you think we are here
to teach men to lie in a new way?

1014
02:25:55,474 --> 02:25:59,020
Why did you sign every
accusation made against you?

1015
02:25:59,228 --> 02:26:02,606
I didn't stop you from killing
yourself to see you like this

1016
02:26:04,191 --> 02:26:05,943
Someone who signs anything

1017
02:26:06,068 --> 02:26:09,030
to please his enemies... to please me

1018
02:26:09,155 --> 02:26:11,615
You knew about a lot of
things in Manchukuo...

1019
02:26:11,782 --> 02:26:13,743
even the secret agreements

1020
02:26:14,035 --> 02:26:16,871
But you couldn't possibly have known
about the Japanese biological warfare

1021
02:26:16,996 --> 02:26:21,665
experiments in Harbin. Could you?

1022
02:26:23,042 --> 02:26:26,170
So why did you sign these papers?

1023
02:26:30,674 --> 02:26:33,135
I was responsible for everything

1024
02:26:33,552 --> 02:26:36,555
You are responsible for what you do

1025
02:26:37,056 --> 02:26:40,392
All your life you thought you
were better than everyone else

1026
02:26:40,851 --> 02:26:43,437
Now you think you are the worse of all

1027
02:26:49,026 --> 02:26:52,028
Why can you not leave me alone?

1028
02:26:53,071 --> 02:26:56,449
You saved my life... to make me
a puppet in your own play

1029
02:26:58,701 --> 02:27:01,454
You saved me because I am useful to you

1030
02:27:01,788 --> 02:27:06,501
Is that so terrible?

1031
02:27:38,906 --> 02:27:41,784
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1032
02:27:46,247 --> 02:27:50,668
By order of the Supreme People's Court...

1033
02:27:50,876 --> 02:27:54,504
the War Criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi...

1034
02:27:54,671 --> 02:27:58,299
male, fifty-three years old...

1035
02:27:58,508 --> 02:28:03,054
of the Manchu nationality and from Peking...

1036
02:28:03,263 --> 02:28:06,599
has now served the years detention

1037
02:28:07,267 --> 02:28:11,146
As a result of remoulding through labour...

1038
02:28:11,521 --> 02:28:15,817
and ideological education...

1039
02:28:16,026 --> 02:28:19,821
during his captivity he has shown
that he has genuinely reformed

1040
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:25,033
In accordance with Clause One
of the Special Pardon Order...

1041
02:28:25,283 --> 02:28:29,037
he is therefore to be released

1042
02:28:40,757 --> 02:28:42,008
You see?

1043
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:46,721
I will end up living in
prison longer than you

1044
02:31:27,999 --> 02:31:30,501
They are so young

1045
02:31:31,168 --> 02:31:33,253
It is dangerous

1046
02:31:40,552 --> 02:31:42,971
Pu Chieh, look

1047
02:31:48,018 --> 02:31:50,062
It is the Governor of our prison

1048
02:31:50,896 --> 02:31:52,022
It cannot be

1049
02:31:52,106 --> 02:31:54,316
It is, I'm sure it is

1050
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:58,320
Be careful

1051
02:32:00,114 --> 02:32:01,489
Come back

1052
02:32:46,574 --> 02:32:50,411
Comrade. This must be a mistake,
I know this man

1053
02:32:50,578 --> 02:32:51,871
He is a good man

1054
02:32:51,954 --> 02:32:52,830
Who are you?

1055
02:32:53,205 --> 02:32:54,582
I am a gardener

1056
02:32:55,082 --> 02:32:57,668
Join us comrade, or fuck off'

1057
02:33:08,303 --> 02:33:09,596
But what has he done?

1058
02:33:09,721 --> 02:33:10,638
He's been accused

1059
02:33:10,722 --> 02:33:11,639
Accused of what?

1060
02:33:11,723 --> 02:33:12,515
Emperor's lackey

1061
02:33:12,557 --> 02:33:13,767
Revisionist element

1062
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:15,060
Rotten rightest

1063
02:33:16,019 --> 02:33:17,312
Confess your crimes

1064
02:33:17,395 --> 02:33:18,605
I have nothing to confess

1065
02:33:19,064 --> 02:33:20,940
Kowtow to Chairman Mao

1066
02:33:25,153 --> 02:33:26,445
Confess your crimes

1067
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,571
I have nothing to confess

1068
02:33:27,905 --> 02:33:29,031
Kowtow

1069
02:33:33,577 --> 02:33:34,411
Confess your crimes

1070
02:33:34,453 --> 02:33:35,662
Wait

1071
02:33:35,745 --> 02:33:38,081
He is a teacher. He is a good teacher

1072
02:33:39,415 --> 02:33:40,750
You cannot do this to him

1073
02:36:46,635 --> 02:36:52,808
Stop. You are not allowed in there

1074
02:36:56,729 --> 02:36:57,563
Who are you?

1075
02:36:57,646 --> 02:36:58,522
I live here

1076
02:36:58,605 --> 02:37:00,024
I am the son of the Guardian

1077
02:37:01,025 --> 02:37:03,277
Ah. Well, I used to live here too

1078
02:37:03,444 --> 02:37:05,195
That is where I sat

1079
02:37:05,321 --> 02:37:06,405
Who are you?

1080
02:37:07,323 --> 02:37:09,950
I was the Emperor of China

1081
02:37:10,117 --> 02:37:11,869
Prove it

1082
02:38:51,546 --> 02:38:53,631
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony...

1083
02:38:53,756 --> 02:38:55,508
where the Emperors were crowned

1084
02:38:55,758 --> 02:38:59,245
The last Emperor to be crowned here
was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi

1085
02:38:59,580 --> 02:39:01,723
He was three years old

1086
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:05,268
He died in 1967
