1
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,565
He's coming! He's coming!

2
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,959
All right, now.

3
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,937
Let's give a good
Colorado welcome here!

4
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,609
- Hello, sir. You're most welcome.
- Thank you, thank you.

5
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,612
All right, everybody, listen up.

6
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,947
I want to introduce you
to Oscar Wilde.

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,649
Welcome to
the Matchless Silver Mine.

8
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,057
Today, we opened up a new seam.

9
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,322
We're gonna name it after you.

10
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,898
How very kind.

11
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,330
I look forward to collecting
the royalties.

12
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,570
Now, why don't you
follow me over here.

13
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,507
Great lecture you gave last night.
We're honored to have you visit us.

14
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,872
If you'd just like to step in here.
There ya go, sir.

15
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,495
I thought I was descending
into hell...

16
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,598
but with these angel faces to greet me,
it must be paradise.

17
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,007
Is this the way to my personal seam?

18
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,171
Of course, I should have preferred
gold-- purple and gold.

19
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,682
But we live in a Silver Age, alas.

20
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,816
So much that is exquisitely beautiful
is wrought from suffering, from pain...

21
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:14,053
from toil-- broken bones
and blistered skin.

22
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,788
Benevenuto Cellini understood silver.

23
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,591
He took the metal that you mine
so nobly down here...

24
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,894
and transformed it into works of art
for popes and princes.

25
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,300
Cellini-- is he a wop?

26
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,032
The Renaissance man, in every sense.

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,938
The greatest silversmith
the world has ever seen...

28
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,704
but a genius in life
as well as art.

29
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:37,145
He experimented with
every vice known to man.

30
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,150
- He committed murder.
- He killed a man?

31
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,718
More than one.

32
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,121
Thank you.

33
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,261
I'd like to meet Cellini.
Why didn't you bring him with you?

34
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,094
I'm afraid he's dead.

35
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,929
Who shot him?

36
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,083
Is Miss Lloyd connected
to Lloyd's Bank?

37
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,195
A pity.

38
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,323
But she's comfortable, Ada.

39
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,026
A thousand a year.

40
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,227
Then I congratulate you, Lady Wilde.

41
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,899
Now that Oscar's been to America
and sown his Wildean oats...

42
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,737
it's time he settled down.

43
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,502
But weren't they very rough?

44
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,943
No, charming.
Well, charming to me.

45
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,175
With each other, it's true
they could be a little brusque.

46
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,582
They hanged two men in the theater
one night before I gave a lecture.

47
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,087
I felt like the sorbet
after a side of beef.

48
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,992
I know your friend is famous, Ada--
notorious, at least--

49
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,690
but I don't understand for what.

50
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,766
For being himself,
Lady Mount-Temple.

51
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,199
Don't Americans talk
the most wonderful slang, though?

52
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,533
Well, I did hear one lady say...

53
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,131
''After the heel-lick
I shifted my day goods.''

54
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,744
What on earth did she mean?

55
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,142
She meant that she changed
her clothes after a dance.

56
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:54,310
Connie, my love, Lady Mount-Temple
is so anxious to meet you.

57
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,251
I knew your father, Miss Lloyd.

58
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,518
She's delightful, and not stupid.
Really, not stupid at all.

59
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,459
Is that quite a reason to marry her?

60
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,529
Well, I must marry someone.

61
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,295
And my mother has our future
planned out in every detail:

62
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,928
I'm to go into Parliament,
we're to have a nice house...

63
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,507
and live a proper, settled life--
literature, lectures...

64
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,907
the House of Commons, receptions
for the world in general at 5:00.

65
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,240
How dreary.

66
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,009
Your attendance will
not be required at those.

67
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,482
But your sphinxiness will be essential
for our intimate little dinners at 8:00.

68
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,351
It will be a grand life,
a charming life.

69
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,015
I see Constance will be busy
preparing the dinners...

70
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
but what will she contribute
to the literature and lectures?

71
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,527
She'll correct the proofs
of my articles.

72
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,563
Oh, what a little sunbeam.

73
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,769
I do love her, Ada. She's--

74
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,005
Silent.

75
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,378
- I find her very silent.
- But so sympathetic.

76
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,383
And I do need an audience.

77
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,826
I don't see how you can possibly
take it all in, reading at that speed.

78
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,696
Try me.

79
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,822
I know better.

80
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,232
Where are we dining tonight?

81
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,930
At the Leversons.

82
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,135
Then you must show your true colors
as a propagandist for dress reform.

83
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,770
The cinnamon
cashmere trousers, I think.

84
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,474
And the cape with the ends
that turn up into sleeves.

85
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,811
I don't think I can wear
those trousers anymore.

86
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,859
A new Wilde for the world!

87
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,861
Another genius for Ireland!

88
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,003
We shall have to buy you
a whole new wardrobe.

89
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,710
Ernest proposed to me
under that statue.

90
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,878
Really, the things that go on in front
of works of art are quite appalling.

91
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,751
The police should interfere.

92
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:48,053
We were made not to marry,
whereas you and Constance are so happy.

93
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,525
Everyone says so.

94
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,722
It's perfectly monstrous how people
say things behind one's back...

95
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,356
that are absolutely true.

96
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,798
So your audience has proved
as responsive as you hoped?

97
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,999
Receptive, yes. Responsive?

98
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,939
I always wonder what she's thinking.

99
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,341
I expect it's about the baby.

100
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,006
Yes. Well, Constance is
such a natural mother.

101
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,949
She's invited Robbie into the nest
while his parents are abroad.

102
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,189
Robbie is Canadian.
You can tell by his youth.

103
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,191
Have you been brought
to England to mature, Mr. Ross?

104
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,819
Well, that was the idea,
but it doesn't seem to be working.

105
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,799
I've lived here since I was three,
and you see the pitiful result.

106
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,563
Robbie comes from a long line
of imperial governors.

107
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,070
His grandfather was
Prime Minister of Upper Canada.

108
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,572
Or was it Lower Canada?

109
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,143
The British will take their class system
with them wherever they go.

110
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,109
They apply it even to continents.

111
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,475
Are you planning
to govern a continent?

112
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,916
No. I don't even plan
to govern myself.

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,754
Very nicely turned leg.

114
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,194
Hello, sir.

115
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,464
Shall I give you these, my love?
I'll see if I can find a cab.

116
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,936
Coming through there, gents.
Mind your backs.

117
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,608
Can you move
out of the way, please?

118
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,227
Looking for someone?

119
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,392
Cab, cab!

120
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,810
Bedtime.

121
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,373
Just one more cigarette.

122
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,481
No. No, thanks, Robbie.

123
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,988
Don't stay up too late, Robbie.

124
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,831
Good night.

125
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,168
Good night, Oscar.

126
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,774
Good night, Robbie.

127
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,291
He's asleep.

128
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,491
He's so beautiful.

129
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,537
Almost as beautiful
as his mother.

130
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,638
I don't know what I'd do without you,
my constant Constance.

131
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,501
Good night, my dear.

132
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,529
Good night.

133
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,956
A university education
is an admirable thing, of course...

134
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,496
so long as you remember that nothing
worth knowing can ever be taught...

135
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,361
least of all at Cambridge.

136
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,365
But you told me...

137
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,404
in ancient Greece the older men
taught the younger.

138
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,097
They drew them out.

139
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,037
I look forward to being
drawn out immensely.

140
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,148
Yes, well, Greek love--
platonic love--

141
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,412
is the highest form of affection
known to man, of course.

142
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,250
You also told me...

143
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,152
that the Greeks put statues of Apollo
in the bride's chamber...

144
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,793
so she would have beautiful sons.

145
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:22,064
But I can't help noticing that here
the statue's in your bedroom.

146
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,828
Constance prefers a bath.

147
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,452
She was so beautiful
when I married her, Robbie.

148
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,119
Slim, white as a lily...

149
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,922
such dancing eyes.

150
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,190
I've never seen such love
in a pair of eyes.

151
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,961
She was--

152
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,898
Nothing should reveal the body...

153
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,395
but the body.

154
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,433
Didn't you say?

155
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,448
There has to be a first time
for everything, Oscar...

156
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,253
even for you.

157
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,037
<i>Hush. There's
a good little fellow.</i>

158
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,834
Come on. Come on, now. There.

159
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,674
Now, come on, Cyril.
It's time for your bath.

160
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,840
Be a good boy.
Don't make such a fuss!

161
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,878
You've got to get undressed.
Come on.

162
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,550
I know you hate it.

163
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,624
Boys, Mrs. Wilde,
they never do what they're told.

164
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,058
Oh, we're going to have
a girl next time.

165
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,688
- Aren't we, Oscar?
- I must go.

166
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,731
Good night, my dear.
Now you behave, Cyril.

167
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,567
Remember, a gentleman should take
a bath at least once a year.

168
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,301
- Good night.
- Come on, Cyril.

169
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,845
It's not that bad.

170
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,347
I shan't be back till late.
I'm dining with the Asquiths.

171
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,848
Hush now.

172
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,112
Come on, now.

173
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,449
Do you love me?

174
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,693
I feel...

175
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,162
like a city that's been...

176
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,632
under siege for 20 years.

177
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,898
Suddenly the gates are thrown open...

178
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,635
and the citizens come pouring out...

179
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,877
to breathe the air
and walk the fields...

180
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,711
and pluck the wildflowers.

181
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,851
I feel...

182
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,488
relieved.

183
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,884
You don't worry about Constance?

184
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,395
<i>''Every afternoon,
on their way home from school...</i>

185
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,025
<i>the children used to play
in the garden of the selfish giant. ''</i>

186
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,399
Is that the garden where we play?

187
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,236
No, this is much larger and lovelier
than that, with soft green grass.

188
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,804
There's grass where we go.

189
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,505
Yes, but are there 1 2 peach trees
that burst into delicate blossoms...

190
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,708
of pink and pearl every springtime
and bear rich fruit in the autumn?

191
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,183
Are there, Mama?

192
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,516
I don't think there are,
Cyril, no.

193
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,286
Would you hand me a matchstick,
and I'll put this hussar's head back on?

194
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,984
Thank you.

195
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,528
''The birds sat on the trees
and sang so sweetly...

196
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,034
that the children used
to stop their games to listen.

197
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,606
'How happy we are here,'
they said to each other.''

198
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,301
I don't know how they could be happy
if there was a giant.

199
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,436
There wasn't, you see, not yet.
He was away, visiting a friend.

200
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,879
You're always away.

201
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,084
Yes, but I only go for a night or two
at a time, and I always come back.

202
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,655
Whereas this giant,
the one whose garden it was...

203
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,691
he'd been away for seven years,
staying with an ogre in Cornwall.

204
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,420
''And after seven years,
when he'd said all he had to say...

205
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,191
because his conversation
was very limited...

206
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,028
he decided to return home
to his own castle.

207
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,003
When he found the children playing
in his garden, he was very angry.

208
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,801
'What are you doing here?' he cried.

209
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,274
And all the children ran away.

210
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,539
'My own garden...

211
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,514
is my own garden!'
said the giant.

212
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,881
'And I won't allow anyone
to play in it except myself.'

213
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,547
So he built a high wall
all around...

214
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,887
put up a large notice board on which
was written, in capital letters:

215
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,154
'Trespassers will be prosecuted.'''

216
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,665
Arthur, you're trespassing.
Cyril will now eat you.

217
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,064
It's Mr. Ross, sir, with Mr. Gray.

218
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,899
Heavens, I must fly.

219
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,836
The horses of Apollo are pawing
impatiently at the gates.

220
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,475
I beg your pardon?

221
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,202
Papa must go.

222
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,343
You will come back
and finish the story?

223
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,611
Of course I will.

224
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,551
Come on, Cyril.
It's almost teatime.

225
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,423
I really don't know why people bother
painting portraits anymore.

226
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,426
You can get a much better likeness
with a photograph.

227
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,092
A photograph's just
one moment in time...

228
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,634
one gesture, one turn of the head.

229
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,034
Yes, portraits are not
likenesses, Mr. Gray.

230
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,267
Painters show the soul
of the subject, the essence.

231
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,708
The essence of the sitter's
vanity, you mean.

232
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,312
Well...

233
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,904
this is a portrait
of Lady Battersby as a young woman.

234
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,648
She's over there,
as a matter of fact.

235
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,620
I must go and console her.

236
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,587
How nice to see you.

237
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,524
Poor thing.

238
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,261
I expect in her heart...

239
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,700
she thinks she still
looks like this.

240
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,069
If we could look young
and innocent forever--

241
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,835
Do you think we'd want to?

242
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,203
If our souls were ugly, yes.

243
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,339
Give a man a mask,
and he'll tell you the truth.

244
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,846
Have we had enough of this?
Shall we go and have dinner somewhere?

245
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,224
<i>Dorian Gray is the most
wonderful book I've ever read.</i>

246
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,765
<i>And the end,
when the servants break in...</i>

247
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,029
and they find him wizened,
old and dead...

248
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,969
and the picture young again--

249
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,165
I fainted.

250
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,575
My family say it's dull and wicked.

251
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,044
Dull?

252
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,012
It's sublime.

253
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,084
It's about the masks
we wear as faces...

254
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,924
and the faces we wear as masks.

255
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,196
That my son should have written
a work of such--

256
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,501
People say it's full
of dangerous paradoxes.

257
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,007
Hardly anyone will speak
to us anymore.

258
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,773
We're ceasing to be respectable.

259
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,213
Artists care nothing
about respectability.

260
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,750
It's only jealousy.

261
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:11,420
It's the spite of the untalented
for the men of genius.

262
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,431
Where is Oscar?

263
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,666
He's in the Lake District,
writing a play.

264
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,435
- A drama?
- A comedy.

265
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,133
Robbie Ross has gone
to keep him company.

266
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,836
I do like Robbie.

267
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,976
And they both love you.

268
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,610
Oh, it'll be a great success.

269
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,719
Oscar's made for the stage.

270
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,798
- Author! Author!
- Author!

271
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,508
Oscar, please!

272
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,212
- Magnificent!
- Well done, everybody.

273
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,937
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have enjoyed this evening immensely.

274
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,568
The actors have given us a charming
rendering of a delightful play...

275
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,045
and your appreciation
has been most intelligent.

276
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,345
I congratulate you on the great success
of your performance...

277
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,751
which persuades me that you think
almost as highly of this play...

278
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,686
as I do myself.

279
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,333
Absolutely splendid, Oscar.
An absolute triumph!

280
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,871
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Well done.

281
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,839
How sweet of you to say so.

282
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,405
It went so well, Oscar.

283
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,878
Even better than I'd--

284
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,543
They loved it.
They absolutely loved it.

285
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,984
And I, dear boy, love you.

286
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,714
Congratulations, Oscar.

287
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,654
Thank you.

288
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,521
It's good to see you.

289
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,855
Hello.

290
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,561
Mr. Wilde.
Wonderful, really wonderful.

291
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,597
- Oscar.
- Sphinx!

292
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,295
You really must be careful.
You're in grave danger of becoming rich.

293
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,800
- It was wonderful. I knew it would be.
- Thank you, Robbie.

294
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,469
Everyone's dying to know
who the real Lady Windermere is.

295
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,343
The real Lady Windermere is every woman
in this room, and most of the men.

296
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,881
- Oscar!
- Lionel!

297
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,178
It's a wonderful play.

298
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,117
My cousin Lord Alfred Douglas
is here.

299
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,950
He would like very much
to congratulate you.

300
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,338
- Wonderful.
- Oscar, this is Bosie Douglas.

301
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,670
We met last year.
Lionel brought me to tea at Tite Street.

302
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,607
How could I possibly forget?

303
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,146
I love your play.

304
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,342
The audience didn't know
whether you meant your jokes or not.

305
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,250
You shocked them...

306
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,015
especially with your speech.

307
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,490
But the more frivolous you seem,
the more serious you are, aren't you?

308
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,892
- I love that.
- Thank you.

309
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,295
I always say,
the young are the only critics...

310
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,457
with enough experience
to judge my work.

311
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,128
- Splendid, Oscar.
- We need shocking.

312
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,104
People are so banal.
And you use your wit like a foil.

313
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,108
You cut through all those
starched shirt fronts.

314
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,406
You draw blood.
It's magnificent.

315
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,642
I wish you'd draw some blood
down in Oxford...

316
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,275
though you'd need a miracle.

317
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,785
All the dons at my college
have dust in their veins.

318
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,619
At which college
do you educate the fellows?

319
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,282
Magdalen.

320
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,019
My own college.

321
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,723
I shall claim the privilege of
a graduate and take tutorials with you.

322
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,433
Come soon, then.
They're threatening to send me down.

323
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,699
How could they be so cruel
to one so beautiful?

324
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,740
Dons-- they're so middle class.

325
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,512
Oscar, you've shocked the whole
of London, smoking on stage like that.

326
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,746
Excellent.
Then we shall run for a year.

327
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,221
Oscar, you must say something
to Marion Terry.

328
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,882
She was good, wasn't she?

329
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:38,052
So good, I think she wrote
most of the lines herself.

330
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,723
- Excuse me, Lord Alfred.
- Bosie, please.

331
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,530
- You must be so thrilled, Oscar.
- I know.

332
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,665
Isn't it humiliating?

333
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,940
<i>'' 'My own garden is my own garden, '
said the giant.</i>

334
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,448
So he built a high wall
all round it...

335
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,483
and put up a notice board:

336
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,918
'Trespassers will be prosecuted.'

337
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,322
He was a very selfish giant.

338
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,589
The poor children
had now nowhere to play.

339
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,527
They tried to play on the road...

340
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,566
but the road was very dusty and full of
hard stones, and they did not like it.

341
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,432
They used to wander round the high wall
when their lessons were over...

342
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,370
<i>and talk about
the beautiful garden inside.</i>

343
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,706
<i>'How happy we were there, '
they said to each other. ''</i>

344
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,271
I hope he was
a very beautiful boy.

345
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,786
Well, pretty, you know,
in a street-Arab sort of way.

346
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,583
There's no point being blackmailed
by an ugly one.

347
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,832
What's tiresome is he's threatened
to show my letters to my father.

348
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,267
Who will show them to all his friends
for the excellence of their style.

349
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,434
You don't know him.
He's a brute.

350
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,339
Really. He carries a whip
wherever he goes.

351
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,948
He used to beat my mother.

352
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,153
He beat my brothers.
He thrashed me from the age--

353
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,450
My dear boy.

354
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,787
Of course, he's
practically illiterate.

355
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,263
He probably won't understand
the letters anyway.

356
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,995
By an unforgivable oversight,
I've never been blackmailed myself...

357
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,629
but my friends assure me that
a hundred pounds will usually suffice.

358
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,139
Really?

359
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,471
God, I-- You promise?

360
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,207
Leave it to Lewis--
George Lewis-- my solicitor.

361
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,715
He knows what he's doing.
He acts for the Prince of Wales.

362
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,425
<i>Leave me not to pine</i>

363
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,592
<i>Alone and desolate</i>

364
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:01,001
<i>No fate seem fair as mine</i>

365
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,337
<i>No happiness</i>

366
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,206
<i>So great</i>

367
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,141
Isn't he killing, Mr. Wilde?

368
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,010
<i>- And nature day by day
- He's perfect.</i>

369
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,175
He's perfect in every way.

370
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:19,188
<i>In accents clear</i>

371
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,919
<i>This joyous roundelay</i>

372
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,354
<i>He loves me</i>

373
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,661
<i>He is here</i>

374
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,777
<i>He loves me</i>

375
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,576
<i>He is here</i>

376
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,987
That was lovely. Well done, Bosie.

377
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,689
Yes, absolutely enchanting.

378
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,298
More tea, anyone?

379
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,046
I don't want to sit here.
I want to sit there.

380
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,146
You heard what Lord Alfred said.

381
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,387
I want everyone to look at us.

382
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,329
I want everyone to say, ''Look,
there's Oscar Wilde with his boy.''

383
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,168
So, what shall we let people
see us eating?

384
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,743
Fois gras and lobster
and champagne.

385
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,511
For two.
We do everything together.

386
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,243
Very good, Mr. Wilde.

387
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,722
I think he enjoyed thrashing me.

388
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,628
All my family are mad.

389
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,796
My uncle slit his throat last year
in a railway hotel.

390
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,271
Which station?

391
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,274
Euston.

392
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,642
All life's really serious journeys
involve a railway terminus.

393
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,451
And now I must go
to the station myself.

394
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,289
Sarah Bernhardt thinks she knows
better than I do how to play Salome.

395
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,415
Stay.

396
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,962
Please stay.

397
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,624
At least till this evening.

398
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,735
Sarah is divine, as you are.

399
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,334
She will be wonderful at the play's
climax when Salome kisses the lips...

400
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,879
of the severed head
ofJohn the Baptist.

401
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,450
''Ah, thou wouldst not suffer me
to kiss thy mouth,Jokanaan.''

402
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,451
Jokanaan is
an old Hebrew name forJohn.

403
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,918
''Well, I will kiss it now.

404
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,786
I will bite it with my teeth
as one bites a ripe fruit.

405
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,292
Yes, I will kiss
thy mouth,Jokanaan.

406
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,490
Thy body is white like the snows
that lie on the mountains...

407
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,399
<i>like the snows that lie
on the mountains ofJudea...</i>

408
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,370
<i>and come down into the valleys.</i>

409
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,839
<i>The roses in the garden
of the queen of Arabia...</i>

410
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,174
<i>are not so white as thy body. ''</i>

411
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,752
<i>I'm not good enough
for him anymore.</i>

412
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,556
I'm just the son
of a carpenter, while Bosie--

413
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,528
Oscar's only ever
been smitten before.

414
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,958
He was smitten with me.
He was smitten with you.

415
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,128
I wasn't smitten.

416
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,842
I loved him.

417
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:12,473
Well, now he's fallen in love.

418
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,949
I'm halfway to hellfire.
I'm not joking.

419
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,020
Someone else was
a carpenter's son.

420
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,086
I've given in
and become a Catholic.

421
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,558
I find confession...

422
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,201
wonderfully consoling.

423
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,859
I can't go to confession...

424
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,169
when I want to kill Bosie...

425
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,173
or myself.

426
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,151
- Oscar's furious.
- He has no right to be.

427
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,917
He knew perfectly well the Lord
Chamberlain would never allow...

428
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,890
a play with biblical characters.

429
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,586
Oscar doesn't think there should be
censorship of plays at all.

430
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,721
Of course there
must be censorship.

431
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,200
Or people would say what they meant,
and then where should we be?

432
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,804
- When is he coming to join us?
- He's not.

433
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,032
He must stay
and look after Lord Alfred.

434
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,372
Those Douglases are always ill,
when they're not demented.

435
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,742
One of them roasted
a kitchen boy on a spit.

436
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,247
And Bosie's father,
Lord Queensberry--

437
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,850
he's a dreadful man, Constance--

438
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,510
eoesn't believe in God
or marriage.

439
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,088
A marquis should set
a proper example...

440
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,318
or what are the upper classes for?

441
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,224
I tell you...

442
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,990
I wouldn't want a daughter of mine
to marry a Douglas.

443
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,959
I haven't got a daughter.

444
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,401
Plenty of time still, my dear.

445
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,711
I see.

446
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,773
It's my fault.

447
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,014
After Vyvyan was born,
all I could think of was the children.

448
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,291
So that's why Oscar spends
so much time with his men friends.

449
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,987
Oscar needs disciples.

450
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,362
Lord Alfred's a poet.
A very fine poet, Oscar says.

451
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,234
He's studying classics.
Oscar and he talk about Plato.

452
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,406
There's nothing wrong.

453
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,371
Really, there isn't.

454
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,741
It's not whether
there is anything wrong.

455
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,646
It's whether or not
there appears to be.

456
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,648
That's all people care about.

457
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:32,585
The empire was not built
by men like Bosie Douglas.

458
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,149
<i>''Then the spring came...</i>

459
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,589
<i>only in the garden of the selfish giant
it was still winter.</i>

460
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,724
<i>The birds did not care to sing in it,
as there were no children.</i>

461
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,303
<i>And the trees forgot to blossom.</i>

462
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,532
<i>The snow covered up the grass
with her great white cloak...</i>

463
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,372
<i>and the frost painted
all the trees silver. ''</i>

464
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,689
Let's go out.

465
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,198
If you like.

466
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,606
The thing about renters is you
don't have to consider their feelings.

467
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,974
But if someone is willing to give one
pleasure, one should show gratitude.

468
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,104
No. Money, that's all they want.

469
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,616
What's wonderful about going
to Taylor's is no one pretends.

470
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,551
You just do it
and be done with it.

471
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,254
I do love you, Oscar.

472
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,159
But variety is
the spice of life.

473
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,072
You can watch me, if you like.

474
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,811
<i>You must attempt to keep a grasp
upon your sobriety.</i>

475
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,043
That is disgusting.
We'll have less of that.

476
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,484
- Good evening.
- Lord Alfred.

477
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,249
Alfred Taylor, this is Oscar.

478
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,086
Delighted to make
your acquaintance, Oscar.

479
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,057
Charles Parker. I remember you.

480
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,524
Hello, Oscar.

481
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,594
Charming to see you again.

482
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,671
- Do you smoke?
- I do everything.

483
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,004
- Yeah, everything that pays.
- Expertly, I might add.

484
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,876
Mr. Wilde, some wine.

485
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,880
Thank you.

486
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,179
- It's a nice case.
- I want you to keep it.

487
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,288
Thank you.

488
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:26,659
So, this is a den of vice.
I should call it more of a garden.

489
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,028
Such pretty flowers, Mr. Taylor.

490
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,624
How wise of you to keep
the curtains closed.

491
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,600
They would never grow
in the common light of day.

492
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,604
- Who are you calling common?
- Certainly not you, dear boy.

493
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,902
You seem to be a flower
of the rarest hue.

494
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,681
Bosie never told me that you
were a botanist, Mr. Taylor...

495
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,917
that you roam the earth, climbing
the highest peaks of the Himalayas...

496
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,221
and plunging
into the darkest forests...

497
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,321
of Borneo to return triumphant...

498
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,299
to this delightful conservatory
in the shadow of Westminster Abbey...

499
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,368
to exhibit your specimens.

500
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,302
The boys are all Londoners, actually.

501
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,075
Impossible.
I see Londoners every day...

502
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,646
but never such
exotic blooms as these.

503
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,908
Does he always talk like this?

504
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,007
Not when he's in bed.

505
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,856
<i>I am discreet.</i>

506
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,864
<i>Bosie is far too grand for that.
He wants everyone to know.</i>

507
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,868
- You must understand--
- I must be with young people, Robbie.

508
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,563
They're so frank and free.

509
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,538
They make me feel young myself.

510
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,973
That's all very well,
but what would you say...

511
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,911
if someone wanted
to go to bed with your son?

512
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,446
Cyril's eight.

513
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,915
What will you say when he's 1 8?

514
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,847
Nothing. He must do
as his nature dictates...

515
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,586
<i>as I only wish I had done.</i>

516
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:08,289
'''I do believe the spring has come
at last,' said the giant.

517
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,264
He jumped out of bed,
and looked out of the window.''

518
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,767
- What did he see?
- You tell me.

519
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,428
No, you tell it.

520
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,600
All right.
''He saw the most wonderful sight.

521
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,735
Through a little hole
in the wall...

522
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,314
the children had crept back
into the garden and were sitting...

523
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,279
on the branches of the trees.

524
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,647
And every tree that he could see,
there was a little child.

525
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,584
The trees were so glad that they--''

526
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,416
They covered themselves
with blossoms!

527
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,888
Blossoms!

528
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,620
''And were waving their arms gently
above the children's heads.

529
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,425
And the birds were twittering
and singing above them with delight.

530
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,434
And the flowers were looking up
through the grass and laughing.

531
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,631
Oscar, it's time the boys changed,
or we'll miss the train.

532
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,641
Come on, boys.

533
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,040
Papa, can't we stay?

534
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,808
Papa's got to work.
He's got to finish his play.

535
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,507
Yes, poor dear Papa.

536
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,812
Poor Papa.

537
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,152
Poor, poor, poor, poor, poor Papa.

538
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,788
<i>Where is Oscar?
We haven't seen him at all.</i>

539
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,797
Where do you think he is? He's working.
He is a writer, after all.

540
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,627
I hear your father's threatening
to shoot Lord Roseberry.

541
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:21,464
Really? He usually
prefers the horsewhip.

542
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,766
Says he's been buggering
your brother.

543
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,707
Well, Roseberry is Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs...

544
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,345
and Francis is
his private secretary.

545
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,914
Actually, Francis is
about to get engaged.

546
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,348
What's your father
talking about, then?

547
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,713
He's obsessed with sex.

548
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,687
He thinks Oscar's buggering me...

549
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,554
as though I'd allow
anyone to do that.

550
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,896
I'm sick of the country.

551
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,402
Let's get back to London.

552
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,350
What's the point of us living together
if you're always working?

553
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,014
- I have responsibilities-- a family.
- God, not that again!

554
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,689
I ask my friends over from Oxford,
and you just disappear.

555
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,097
I'd be better off
staying at my mother's.

556
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,469
- At least she's there.
- You asked me to take this house--

557
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,167
Now I'm bored with it.

558
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,871
- And with you.
- I can't give it up.

559
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,381
It's paid for in advance.
Until I finish my new--

560
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,384
Bosie, dear...

561
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,784
you have beauty,
you have breeding...

562
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,449
and, most glorious of all,
you have youth.

563
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,117
But you are very fantastical
if you think that pleasures...

564
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,786
don't have to be earned
and paid for.

565
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,765
Whenever I want to do anything,
you say you can't afford it...

566
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,233
but you give all those renters
cigarette cases.

567
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,498
But I've lavished presents on you!

568
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,370
Every penny I've earned from my play
I have spent on you!

569
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,170
I'm sure you've been counting.

570
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,473
You're so mean
and penny-pinching...

571
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,142
and middle-class, all you can
think about is your bank balance.

572
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,275
For God's sake!
This is intolerable!

573
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,915
No gentleman ever has the slightest idea
what his bank balance is!

574
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,118
You're absurd!

575
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,558
Telling everyone
how they ought to live.

576
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,292
You're so vulgar!

577
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,991
I never want
to see you again, ever.

578
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,697
All right, then.
If that's what you want, then you go!

579
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,431
Get out!

580
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,679
<i>''But in the farthest corner
of the garden...</i>

581
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:48,114

was standing a little boy.</i>

582
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,484
<i>He was so small, he could not reach up
to the branches of the tree.</i>

583
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,490

- But you mustn't idle your time away.
- Mother.

587
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,235
And I want you
to promise me something:

588
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,067
not to write to Oscar Wilde.

589
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,740
I can't do that.
I love Oscar.

590
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,108
I love him as a disciple
loves his teacher.

591
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,514
But he's not fit to teach anything.
He's evil.

592
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,255
Do you really think your own son
could love someone evil?

593
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,392
I just wish I could love Oscar
as loyally, devotedly...

594
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,258
unselfishly and purely
as he loves me.

595
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,661
But I'm not as good as he is.

596
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,401
I probably never will be.

597
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,908
Good-bye, then.

I'm delighted, of course,

but please don't try and make

607
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,212
They should sound completely
spontaneous and natural...

608
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,479
as though people spoke
like that all the time.

609
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,920
Yes, of course.

Let's try again.

611
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,662
You should break with Bosie
more often, Oscar.

612
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:44,063
Then we'd have more of
your spontaneous and natural plays.

613
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,069
Bosie was envious.
That's why he stopped Oscar working.

614
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,467
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.

615

His poems aren't nearly
as good as you pretend...

616
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,233
and he knows it.

617
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,279
- He's just a shallow little--
- Rivulet.

618
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,341
Bosie's a child, a vulnerable child.
He needs love.

619
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,216
We all need love.

00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,407
<i>To you and your kin</i>

626
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,975
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

627
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,477
<i>And a happy New Year</i>

628
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,980
- Cracker time!
- It is cracker time.

629
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,880
I won this time. Look. There.
One for you, one for me.

630
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,511
<i>''And the giant's heart melted
as he looked out.</i>

631
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:42,784
<i>'How selfish I have been, '
he said.</i>

632
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,987
<i>'Now I know why the spring
would not come here.</i>

633
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,690
<i>I will put that little boy
on top of the tree...</i>

634
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,993
<i>and I will knock down the wall,
and my garden shall be...</i>

635
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,763
<i>the children's playground
forever and ever. '</i>

636
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,804
<i>He was really very sorry
for what he had done. ''</i>

637
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,235
This is really nice, even though--

638
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,073
<i>''So he crept downstairs and opened
the front door quite softly...</i>

639
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,206
<i>and went out into the garden.</i>

640
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,685
<i>that he did not see
the giant coming.</i>

641
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,191
<i>And the giant stole up behind him
and took him gently by the hand...</i>

642
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,387
<i>and put him up into the tree.</i>

643
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,488
<i>And the tree broke
at once into blossom...</i>

644
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,193
<i>and the birds came and sang on it,
and the little boy...</i>

645
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,360
<i>stretched out his two arms...</i>

646
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,769
<i>and flung them
round the giant's neck...</i>

647
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,534
<i>and kissed him. ''</i>

648
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,875
I don't care what people think.
I love you.

649
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,481
It's all that matters to me.
It was agony being away from you.

650
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,344
Well, here I am.

651
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,781
Oh, Bosie, you're
my catastrophe, my doom.

652
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,717
Everyone says so, even me.

653
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,688
I missed you.

654
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:27,086
I thought you might like something
to celebrate your return.

655
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,103
When I saw them in the window,
they begged me on their knees...

656
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,797
to make them yours.

657
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,037
I'll put them on now.
They're superb.

658
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,820
- I'll sit there. I want a proper table.
- Is there something wrong, my lord?

659
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,729
This young fool wants me
to sit by the service door.

660
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,800
Oh, God, my father.

661
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,564
I'm extremely sorry. He's new,
and he didn't know who you were.

662
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,639
Bosie, you're not going to flee.

663
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,941
Give me the menu.

664
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,890
I'll have the pea soup
and then the salmon.

665
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,925
Will you have it with us, Papa?

666
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,058
I'm lunching with Oscar Wilde.
Will you join us?

667
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,468
I told you never to see
that vile cur again.

668
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:46,098
He's not vile or a cur.
He's utterly delightful. Come and see.

669
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,272
How do you know what he's like
when you've never met him?

670
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,781
You're not a man to be influenced
by other people's opinions.

671
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,430
Oscar, you've never met
my father, have you?

672
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,031
Lord Queensberry.

673
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:17,100
Bosie has told me so much about
your exploits on the racetrack.

674
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:23,579
I've never heard such bad luck
as yours with the Grand National.

675
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,943
Bosie tells me
that you would have won...

676
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,278
but that your cousin
wouldn't let you ride the horse?

677
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,112
Bloody fool said I was too old.

678
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,885
Why, you're never too old.
I'd ridden Old Joe on the gallops.

679
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,259
Came in at 40 to 1 .

680
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,761
No horse could ever have carried me
over the jumps, I fear.

681
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,263
What are you having?

682
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,162
- Pea soup and salmon.
- Then I shall join you.

683
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,567
Spring is the time
to lunch on salmon...

684
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,107
though I always think it tastes so much
nicer if you've caught it yourself.

685
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,942
You fish?

686
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,137
I used to when I lived in Ireland.

687
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,545
My father had the most charming
hunting lodge...

688
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,879
on an island in a lake.

689
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,977
- Do you know the west of Ireland?
- Not really.

690
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,888
Whereabouts, exactly?

691
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,708
The Christians go around pretending
they know who God is and how He works.

692
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,710
I've got no time for that tomfoolery.

693
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,714
If you don't know something,
you should stand up and say so...

694
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,615
not go around pretending
you believe in some mumbo jumbo.

695
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,654
I can believe in anything,
provided it's incredible.

696
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,952
That's why I intend to die a Catholic,
though I couldn't possibly live as one.

697
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,292
Catholicism is such a romantic religion.
It has saints and sinners.

698
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,632
The Church of England
only has respectable people...

699
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,134
who believe in respectability.

700
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,263
You get to be a bishop not by what
you believe but by what you don't.

701
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,367
That's true enough.

702
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:03,035
It's the only church where
the skeptic stands at the altar...

703
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,013
and St. Thomas the Doubter
is prince of the apostles.

704
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,617
No, I couldn't possibly die
in the Church of England.

705
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,312
Where do you stand on cremation?

706
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,220
I'm not sure I have a position.

707
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,327
I'm for it.

708
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,556
I wrote a poem:

709
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,861
''When I am dead, cremate me.''

710
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,199
That's how it begins.

711
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,399
''When I am dead, cremate me.''

712
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,738
What do you think of that
for an opening line?

713
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,877
It's challenging.

714
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,243
I'm a challenging sort of man.

715
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,408
That's why people don't like me.

716
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,180
I don't go along with
the ordinary ways of thinking.

717
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,379
Then we are exactly alike.

718
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,715
Another glass of brandy?

719
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,692
I find that alcohol,
taken in sufficient quantities...

720
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,126
can produce all the effects
of drunkenness.

721
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,298
You were there for ages.

722
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:03,270
You stayed talking till after 4:00.
I knew you'd like him.

723
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,204
Well, he's got charm,
I admit that.

724
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,741
But that's bad.

725
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,107
Men shouldn't be charming.

726
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,647
It's disgusting.
I don't think much of his action.

727
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,546
Let's have a look at the bay.

728
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,778
Mind you, Wilde's no fool.

729
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,481
Talks wonderfully,
really wonderfully.

730
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:24,082
But that means nothing
when what he says is such rot.

731
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,889
Worse than rot-- evil.

732
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,657
Which is why I insist
you stop seeing him forthwith.

733
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,664
''Insist''?
What's that supposed to mean?

734
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,965
It means I will cut off your allowance
if you don't do as I say.

735
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,269
- Trot him up and down a bit!
- Look, Father.

736
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,539
You wasted time at Oxford pretending
you were going into the Foreign Office.

737
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,876
Thank God you didn't
when thatJew queer Roseberry...

738
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,814
can become Foreign Secretary and bugger
all the juniors, including your brother.

739
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,417
That's all lies.

740
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,918
You spent your whole time
writing obscene poetry.

741
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,522
My poems aren't obscene.

742
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,490
They're in the manner of Wilde.
That's filthy enough for me.

743
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,128
Have you ever actually read
any of Oscar's poems?

744
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,164
I wouldn't sully my mind
with perverted trash like that.

745
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,164
Tell him to pick his feet up!

746
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,428
He's not straight!

747
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,767
Are you calling Oscar a pervert?

748
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,306
Because that's libelous.

749
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,808
I'm not saying he is one.
I'm saying he's posing as one...

750
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,174
which is worse.

751
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,179
His wife's divorcing him.

752
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,079
Did you know that?
For sodomy!

753
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,086
- That's completely untrue!
- I hope it is.

754
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,623
Because if it were true,
I'd shoot him on sight.

755
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,962
You will cease to see Wilde,
or I'll cut you off without a penny.

756
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,694
As though I wanted your money...

757
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,272
what little you have left
from your tarts.

758
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,132
How dare you speak
to your father like that.

759
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,643
What a funny little man you are.

760
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,139
Come back here,
you filthy-minded sissy!

761
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,842
You're absurd!

762
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,613
And you're nothing but a bum-boy!

763
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,585
You're pathetic!

764
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,457
I'm a bloody good shot.
Better than he is.

765
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,690
I'll shoot him through the heart
if he threatens me.

766
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,993
Hadn't you better use
a silver bullet then?

767
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,932
Here's one for the Black Douglas.

768
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,196
Bosie, for God's sake!

769
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,932
And one for his liver!
One for his lights!

770
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,769
One for his stinking rotten soul!

771
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,975
I'll save one for myself.

772
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,142
My own father--
he wants to kill me.

773
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,697
My life is everything
I ever wanted.

774
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,464
I have fame.

775
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,508
I have recognition.

776
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,736
With two plays
about to open in London...

777
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,576
I may even have money.

778
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,950
The world is at my command...

779
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,118
yet I can't command myself.

780
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,520
I can't command
my feelings for you.

781
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,600
<i>- Thank you.
- Constance, my dear.</i>

782
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,111
How nice.

783
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,222
I brought you your letters.

784
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,489
You haven't been home
for so long.

785
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,120
Thank you.

786
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,527
It's so much more convenient
for Oscar living in the West End...

787
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,833
when he has a play coming on.

788
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:01,672
I'm like a northern businessman
keeping an eye on his factory.

789
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,075
The boys ask for you
all the time.

790
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,842
They're longing to see you.

791
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,213
Oscar has to make sure
the play's a success, Constance.

792
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,912
I'll come round this afternoon...

793
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,749
for tea.

794
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,050
It's the dress rehearsal
this afternoon.

795
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,429
Tomorrow then.
I'll come tomorrow.

796
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,229
Well, tomorrow then.

797
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,974
Good-bye, my dear.

798
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,078
Good-bye.

799
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,012
Good-bye, Constance.

800
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,599
- Something like that.
- I'm not trying to get anything.

801
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,638
I hope so. It would be rather fun.
Perhaps a codfish.

802
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,604
Codfish. I've a strong feeling
that codfish live rather deeper.

803
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,903
- Do you think we'll have skate--
- Possibly.

804
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,982
I don't think there'll be anything
for our table tonight, my love. No luck.

805
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,552
I think I'd better stay.
You're getting a cold.

806
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,753
No, no. I'm all right.
Let's get the boys some ices.

807
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,921
- Boys, you stay and look after nanny.
- Oh, all right.

808
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,063
We'll look after nanny.

809
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:35,068
I could take the boys to the dentist
on Thursday on their way back to school.

810
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,069
But the whole point of them
having dentistry now...

811
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,574
is so they can stuff themselves with
sweets for a week before we lose them.

812
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,246
- Are you quite sure?
- Bosie'll look after me.

813
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,069
Get your coat on, quick!

814
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,231
I've got a present for you!

815
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,742
Oh, God.

816
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:20,178
- You're not still seedy, are you?
- Bosie, where have you been?

817
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,751
I've had no one to talk to,
no one to look after me.

818
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,548
Don't be so pathetic.
I've found you the divinest boy.

819
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,487
- Bosie, you promised Constance--
- Bugger Constance.

820
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,150
I'm not your nanny.
Come on. We're going out.

821
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,354
Bosie, please.

822
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,961
You look such an idiot
lying there. Revolting.

823
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,264
- Have you forgotten how to wash?
- As a matter of fact...

824
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,135
I'm dying for a glass of water.

825
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:49,276
- You know where the jug is.
- Bosie, darling.

826
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:53,143
It stinks in here. You'll be wanting me
to empty your chamber pot next.

827
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,309
Well, I emptied your chamber pot.
I looked after you.

828
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,718
Well, I'm not looking after you.
Not now.

829
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,347
You don't interest me.
Not when you're ill.

830
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,120
You're just a boring middle-aged man
with a blocked-up nose.

831
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:09,424
- Bosie, dearest boy.
- Shut up!

832
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,298
''Dearest boy, darling Bosie.''
It doesn't mean anything.

833
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,700
You don't love me. The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.

834
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,001
You like me.
You lust after me.

835
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:23,704
You go about with me because
I've got a title. That's all.

836
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,144
You like to write about
dukes and duchesses...

837
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,715
but you know nothing about them.

838
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,545
You're the biggest snob
I've ever met...

839
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,018
and you think you're so daring
because you fuck the occasional boy.

840
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,352
Please, you're killing me.

841
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,187
You'll just about do
when you're at your best.

842
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,558
You're amusing-- very amusing-- but when
you're not at your best, you're no one.

843
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,828
All I asked for
was a glass of water.

844
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,701
For Christ's sake!
There you are then!

845
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,535
Now will you shut up
about the fucking water?

846
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,481
There are two boys
waiting out there.

847
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,847
If you're not coming,
I'll fuck them both myself.

848
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:08,481
I'll take them to the Grand and
fuck them in front of the whole hotel...

849
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,025
and I'll send you the bill.

850
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,008
Drink this.

851
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:34,242
- It will help your fever.
- He's ashamed of loving men.

852
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,053
His father bullies him,
his mother spoils him...

853
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,248
and then berates him
for being spoiled.

854
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,954
Neither of them gives him any real love.
They're torturing him.

855
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,159
And what's truly dreadful
is that when...

856
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:55,930
he can't bear it
and has one of his--

857
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,130
he becomes
exactly like his father.

858
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:02,507
- And he hates himself for that.
- You're too kind about him.

859
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,973
You can't be too kind about
someone who's been so hurt.

860
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:14,318
Yet if I go on trying to come
between Bosie and his father...

861
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,983
that'll destroy me.

862
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,925
Bosie's quite capable
of destroying you on his own.

863
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,194
Look how much you wrote
while he was away.

864
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,735
Two wonderful plays
which will run for years.

865
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,669
Back comes Bosie,
and what have you written since?

866
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:43,546
You know how much I...

867
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,085
love and admire you...

868
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,448
but you're throwing
your genius away.

869
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,188
- For what?
- It's highly ironic.

870
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,788
Queensberry thinks Bosie and I
are locked in nightly embrace...

871
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:02,064
and in reality, we've been
the purest model of Greek love since--

872
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:09,176
Bosie doesn't like doing it with me,
but I've loved him.

873
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,973
- I've educated him.
- But he's never grown up.

874
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,044
And he never will.

875
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,184
I'm not taking him back, Robbie.

876
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,948
Not again.

877
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,288
I can't.

878
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,455
I've been very foolish,
very fond...

879
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,201
but now I must grow up myself.

880
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,066
Oh, please, don't do that.

881
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,573
You're an artist.
Artists are always children at heart.

882
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,602
Oh, Robbie,
I sometimes I wonder if--

883
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,280
Back page, sir.

884
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,554
My God. Francis Douglas.

885
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,560
- What?
- Bosie's brother.

886
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,189
He's been found shot.
He's dead.

887
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,401
But he's just got engaged.

888
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:16,975
Poor, poor Bosie.
He'll be utterly distraught.

889
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,920
<i>He killed himself.</i>

890
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:33,628
It was my father.
He drove him to it.

891
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,529
I'm sure your father's
just as upset as everyone else.

892
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,225
No, he's not.

893
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:47,033
He says it's a judgment
on Roseberry and my mother...

894
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,905
and me and you.

895
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,680
We've got to stop him, Oscar...

896
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,390
before he drives
my whole family to suicide.

897
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,293
I promise you, I won't let him
hurt you ever again.

898
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,766
I promise.

899
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,742
It's not enough.
I want him stopped.

900
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,784
I want the whole world
to know what he's done...

901
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,847
what an evil man he is.

902
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,260
Table, my lord?

903
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,957
Is Lord Alfred here?
And that shit and sod Wilde?

904
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,193
No, my lord. Not tonight.

905
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,427
Bugger must be at Kettner's.

906
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,051
Is my son staying here?

907
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,117
Is Lord Alfred Douglas
staying here?

908
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,785
No, sir, he's not.

909
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,357
- What about Wilde?
- No, sir.

910
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:25,264
If I find
they have been staying here...

911
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,569
I'll give you the biggest
whipping of your life.

912
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:05,106
Well, I expect you two would
like a drink after your exertions.

913
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,749
I must ask you to leave,
Mr. Wilde.

914
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,758
My dear man,
what are you talking about?

915
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,193
At once, please.

916
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:27,161
What's the matter? My father
cracking the whip downstairs, is he?

917
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,608
- My lord.
- Bosie.

918
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,343
You're not frightened of what
this little man thinks, are you?

919
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,216
I think the pleasures of the evening
should be resumed elsewhere.

920
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,521
You're such a coward.

921
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,723
You say you despise convention...

922
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,130
but you're the most
conventional man I know.

923
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,428
Come on then.
If we're going, let's go.

924
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,044
Until tomorrow, Tommy.

925
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,175
Good-bye, sir.

926
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,584
I goes in, and there's
all this tropical fruit laid out.

927
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,617
Wait a minute, Oscar!

928
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:31,089
Alfred, how nice to see you.
And Charlie, looking so well.

929
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,600
I'm afraid I'm busy this evening,
but we must have dinner again soon.

930
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:39,072
It's not a question of dinner.
I got a letter of yours to Lord Alfred.

931
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,870
It's a nice letter, Oscar.
Beautiful.

932
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:45,775
''Lips like roses. The madness
of kisses in ancient Greece.''

933
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,007
Then I expect
it's one of my prose poems.

934
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,675
There's a gentleman's
offered me 60 pounds for it.

935
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,616
Then you must accept, Alfred.
I've never received so large a sum...

936
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,983
for a prose work of that length
in all my life.

937
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,617
Tell him I'm delighted that someone
in England values my work so highly.

938
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,661
- Well, he's gone away.
- He's gone to the country.

939
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,922
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

940
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,034
Oscar, look. You couldn't
let us have something, could you?

941
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,972
Bit short at the moment.
You know.

942
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,778
Of course. Of course.

943
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,642
Here's half a sovereign. Now you mind
you take good care of that letter.

944
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:23,273
Lord Alfred is going to publish it
in sonnet form in his new magazine.

945
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,585
For fuck's sake.

946
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,319
It's no good
trying to rent you.

947
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,225
You just laugh at us.

948
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,387
- Here.
- Thank you.

949
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:40,297
He can be very careless,
Lord Alfred.

950
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,436
What a wonderfully
wicked life you lead.

951
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,939
You boys. You boys.

952
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,513
- Where is he?
- Mr. Wilde is not receiving visitors.

953
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:57,049
- Where is he?
- He's busy, sir. I cannot--

954
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,780
I wish you would get out of my way.
Get out of my way!

955
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,658
Excuse me, sir,
there's a gentleman--

956
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:05,919
You!

957
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,390
Listen to me.

958
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,691
You're a bugger!

959
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,234
I don't allow people to talk to me like
that in my house, Lord Queensberry...

960
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,739
or anywhere else.

961
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:23,242
I suppose you've come to apologize for
the lies you've been spreading about me?

962
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:27,475
I've come to tell you
to leave my son alone, you sodomite.

963
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,485
The marquis appears to be very obsessed
with other people's sexual activities.

964
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,554
Has it anything to do
with his new wife...

965
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:37,158
I wonder, and the fact that she's
seeking divorce for non-consummation?

966
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,285
Unless you swear that you'll have
nothing more to do with Bosie...

967
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,829
I shall go to Scotland Yard.

968
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,262
You can go to the devil.

969
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,766
You and your--
Who is this gargoyle?

970
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,770
You're a queer!
And a sham! A poseur!

971
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,636
If I catch you and Bosie together again,
I'll give you such a thrashing.

972
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:59,175
I believe Lord Queensberry
once invented some rules for boxing.

973
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,078
I've no idea what they are...

974
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,115
but the Oscar Wilde rule
is to shoot on sight.

975
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,913
- Now, kindly leave my house.
- You can shut up!

976
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,955
I shall leave
when I'm damn well ready.

977
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,154
It's a scandal
what you've been doing.

978
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,460
All the scandal is your own.

979
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,866
Your treatment of your wives...

980
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,835
your neglect of your children...

981
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,271
and, above all,
the depraved insistence...

982
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:31,369
that they be as tyrannical
and unloving as you are yourself.

983
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,640
Arthur, this is
the Marquis of Queensberry...

984
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:40,279
the most infamous brute
and the least tender father in London.

985
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,287
Never let him
into my house again.

986
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,325
Very well then.

987
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,123
Let's get out of this stew.

988
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,240
- Out of the way, then!
- I'm sorry, sir!

989
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:43,216
I'm very sorry,
but it's just not possible!

990
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,456
What are you doing?
Rotten vegetables?

991
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,357
Give that to Oscar Wilde.

992
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,556
Thank you, sir.
We'll take care of it.

993
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:02,330
I wanted to give it to him
personally as a bouquet.

994
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,405
I daresay you did, sir,
but you're not going to.

995
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:10,709
He's a cur and a sod!

996
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,471
And a bugger!

997
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,377
You remember that!

998
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,286
I always told you, Gwendolen,
my name is Ernest, didn't I?

999
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,686
Well, it is Ernest after all.

1000
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,851
I mean, it naturally is Ernest.

1001
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:29,419
Yes, I remember now
that the general was called Ernest.

1002
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:33,695
I knew I had some particular reason
for disliking the name.

1003
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,828
Ernest! My own Ernest!

1004
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,535
I knew from the first
you could have had no other name.

1005
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:45,772
Gwendolen, it's a terrible thing
for a man to find out suddenly...

1006
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,748
that all his life he's been
speaking nothing but the truth.

1007
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,749
Can you forgive me?

1008
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,481
I can, for I feel
you are sure to change.

1009
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,115
- My own one!
- Laetitia.

1010
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,091
Frederick! At last!

1011
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:04,358
- Cecily! At last!
- Gwendolen! At last!

1012
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:10,768
My nephew, you seem to be
displaying signs of triviality.

1013
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,204
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...

1014
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,402
I've now realized
for the first time in my life...

1015
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,948
the vital importance
of being earnest.

1016
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,576
Allen, you were wonderful!
Thank you all so much.

1017
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,044
They're calling for you.
You must come on. Curtain, curtain.

1018
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,547
- No, no, George, no, no.
- Come on!

1019
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,531
- Mr. Wilde, sir.
- Yes?

1020
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:50,034
- For you.
- Thank you.

1021
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,242
''For Oscar Wilde...

1022
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,684
Ponce,'' is it?

1023
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,086
''Ponce and 'somdomite.'''

1024
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:13,321
''Posing as a sodomite.''
He's illiterate-- illiterate, ignorant.

1025
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:16,420
- It's hideous.
- We've got him now, Robbie.

1026
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,328
He wrote it down.
The porter read it.

1027
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,196
That makes it a public libel.
Now we can take him to court.

1028
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,395
For God's sake.

1029
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,700
Oscar, you mustn't do that.
That would be-- I mean--

1030
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,143
We've just been waiting for a chance
to get him in the dock...

1031
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,044
and show the world what a swine
and shit he's always been.

1032
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:39,051
- To me, my mother, my brothers.
- But he'll plead justification.

1033
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,883
He'll call all the renters
as witnesses for the defense.

1034
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,787
Of course he won't.
He doesn't know what a renter is.

1035
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,397
I hear he's had detectives following you
ever since you came back from Egypt.

1036
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,091
He can't prove anything.
But we can.

1037
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,697
We can prove he's the vilest man
that ever walked the earth.

1038
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,635
Tear the card up, Oscar.
Pretend you never got it.

1039
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,798
Are you mad?
That's our main piece of evidence.

1040
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,400
I'm sure if Oscar went abroad
for a few months...

1041
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,570
lived on royalties
while your father calms down--

1042
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,275
- Whose side are you on?
- Bosie, if this goes to court...

1043
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,408
Oscar will have to tell lies...

1044
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,283
perjure himself--
everything will come out.

1045
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,185
Whatever the result,
it will be utter disaster.

1046
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,950
You're an enemy then.

1047
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:22,086
No, no, Bosie, please.
Robbie...

1048
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:25,724
you're a dear boy, but I can't
even think of leaving the country.

1049
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:30,930
As a matter of fact, I can't even
leave this hotel. I can't pay the bill.

1050
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,701
We can raise you money,
for heaven's sake.

1051
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,469
Anyway, what about
your royalties?

1052
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,511
We shall need all the money
we can get for the libel case.

1053
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,216
My father can't go on making
all our lives a torment like this.

1054
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,386
Oscar, I beg you.

1055
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,148
I'm not going to run away, Robbie.

1056
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,623
I'm not going to hide.
That would be the English thing to do.

1057
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:56,197
If you take Queensberry to court,
all hell will break loose.

1058
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,858
All my life I've fought
against the English vice:

1059
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,868
hypocrisy--
not that that's the point.

1060
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:07,407
The point is, Queensberry's already
caused the death of one of his sons.

1061
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:11,444
If I don't try and stop him now,
whom will he harm next?

1062
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,413
<i>He's avoiding me, Robbie.</i>

1063
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:20,415
I know what everyone's saying,
but it's not true.

1064
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,420
It's not true.

1065
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:27,220
- Is it?
- Of course not.

1066
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,662
Oh, it's so shaming.

1067
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,800
No, I find it easier to stand.

1068
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:41,205
I'm going to Torquay for a month,
try to get my back right.

1069
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,745
- Oscar's been so busy--
- I'm sure he'll be terribly upset...

1070
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,281
when he knows you've been
in so much pain.

1071
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:53,552
The truth is,
I need some money.

1072
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:57,488
Not even sure where he is
to ask for it.

1073
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:00,389
It does seem rather hard when he's
having such an extraordinary success.

1074
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,086
I think I can find him.

1075
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,369
I keep hearing these stories
about Bosie and his father.

1076
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:12,803
- I'm sure you don't want to--
- Oh, yes. I do.

1077
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:19,170
Men think women should be
protected by not knowing.

1078
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,680
Not knowing only makes it worse.

1079
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:27,483
Is there going to be trouble?

1080
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,453
I hope not.

1081
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,962
<i>I believe a prosecution
would certainly succeed...</i>

1082
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,962
provided--
and I stress this--

1083
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:42,001
provided there is no truth whatever in
the accusation made by Lord Queensberry.

1084
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,001
Of course
there's no truth in it.

1085
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:51,204
Then so long as I have Mr. Wilde's
assurance that that is indeed the case.

1086
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,585
There is no truth
in the accusation whatever.

1087
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:08,456
Good. Excellent.

1088
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:13,225
The defense, I understand,
will be led by Mr. Edward Carson.

1089
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:17,995
Old Ned? I was at college
with him in Dublin.

1090
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:22,509
No doubt he will perform his task with
all the bitterness of an old friend.

1091
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:27,273
In writing a book or a play,
I'm concerned entirely with literature--

1092
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:31,545
with art-- I do not aim
at doing good or evil...

1093
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:33,917
but at making a thing that will have
some quality of beauty.

1094
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:39,358
Well, listen, sir. Here is
one of your pieces of literature.

1095
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,258
''Wickedness is a myth
invented by good people...

1096
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,728
to account for the curious
attractiveness of others.''

1097
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,028
Do you think that true?

1098
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,538
Oh, I rarely think
anything I write is true.

1099
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:59,272
''If one tells the truth, one is sure,
sooner or later, to be found out.''

1100
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,778
That is a pleasing paradox, but
I do not set store by it as an axiom.

1101
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,321
Is it good for the young?

1102
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,687
Anything is good that stimulates
thought, at whatever age.

1103
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,624
Whether moral or immoral?

1104
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,662
There's no such thing
as morality or immorality in thought.

1105
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,423
What about this then?

1106
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,268
''Pleasure is the only thing
one should live for.''

1107
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,898
I think that the realization of
one's self is the prime aim of life...

1108
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:32,343
and that to realize through pleasure is
finer than to do so through pain.

1109
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,315
I am, on this point, entirely on
the side of the ancients, the Greeks.

1110
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,517
<i>How long have you known
Alfred Taylor?</i>

1111
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,457
<i>About two years,
two-and-a-half years.</i>

1112
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:49,324
- Is he an intimate friend of yours?
- I wouldn't call him that, no.

1113
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,022
But you went often to his rooms?

1114
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,465
About seven or eight times,
perhaps.

1115
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:58,801
Did you know Mr. Taylor kept
ladies' dresses in his rooms?

1116
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:06,577
Did you know he was notorious
for introducing young men to older men?

1117
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:09,979
I never heard it in my life.

1118
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,985
Has he introduced
young men to you?

1119
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,985
Yes.

1120
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:18,683
- How many young men?
- About five.

1121
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:23,423
- What were their occupations?
- I really don't know.

1122
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,159
Oh, well, let me tell you,
Mr. Wilde.

1123
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:30,134
You met a man called
Charles Parker there, I believe.

1124
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,363
Yes.

1125
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:34,237
Charles Parker is...

1126
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,240
a gentleman's valet.

1127
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,643
You met his brother there
too, I believe.

1128
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:42,078
- Yes.
- He is a groom.

1129
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,483
I didn't care tuppence
what they were.

1130
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:51,184
I liked them. I have a passion
to civilize the community.

1131
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,659
I recognize no social distinctions
at all of any kind.

1132
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,788
To me, youth--
the mere fact of youth--

1133
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:02,063
is so wonderful that I would sooner
talk to a young man for half an hour...

1134
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:06,539
than, well, than be
cross-examined in court.

1135
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:09,666
So, do I understand that...

1136
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,214
even a boy you might pick up in the
street would be a pleasing companion?

1137
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:17,546
I would talk to a street Arab
with pleasure if he would talk to me.

1138
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,483
- And take him to your rooms?
- Yes.

1139
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:22,214
And then commit
improprieties with him?

1140
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,320
Certainly not.

1141
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:32,558
<i>You withdraw your libel action
against Lord Queensberry.</i>

1142
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,634
Well and good.

1143
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:38,102
But there remains the question
of the evidence--

1144
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,697
Lord Queensberry's evidence
against you.

1145
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:46,075
My information is that the Crown
wishes to pursue the matter.

1146
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:52,610
In which case, an arrest
and a charge of gross indecency...

1147
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,711
are certain to follow.

1148
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:58,657
The maximum sentence
is two years hard labor.

1149
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:02,695
Nine months hard labor
is reckoned to be more...

1150
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,695
than a man of our background...

1151
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,595
can survive.

1152
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,235
The children, the boys--

1153
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,398
- I must go and see them.
- You have no time for that.

1154
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:18,809
But my wife--
I have to say good-bye to my wife.

1155
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,541
Unless you positively wish
to subject her...

1156
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,014
to the further humiliation
of seeing you arrested...

1157
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,350
and taken away
in front of the gutter press...

1158
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,286
<i>Mr. Wilde,you must go.</i>

1159
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,295
Oscar, you must take that train.

1160
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,268
Practically everyone
you know will be on it.

1161
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:47,966
At least 600 single gentlemen,
all in abject terror of arrest.

1162
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:56,411
Where your life leads you,
you must go.

1163
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,644
<i>I defy society.</i>

1164
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,278
Tell him to go.

1165
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,590
He must save himself.

1166
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,419
Tell him to go abroad.

1167
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,692
I've been telling him all day.

1168
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,928
He won't budge.

1169
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:26,342
People have never understood
the courage he needed to be himself.

1170
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,574
You must go abroad too.

1171
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,777
We must all go abroad at once.

1172
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,450
Oscar says, will you
tell the boys good-bye.

1173
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,721
I need to go through his papers.

1174
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:48,662
You know,
I was always too silent.

1175
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,667
If I'd known--

1176
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,268
If I'd only spoken up.

1177
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,472
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

1178
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,775
Perhaps not...

1179
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:08,047
but at least I wouldn't
blame myself now.

1180
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,978
<i>You're an Irish gentleman.
Of course,you must stay.</i>

1181
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,381
Your father fought
when he was libeled.

1182
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,318
<i>- I was in the courts myself. I fought--
- Yes, I know, Madre.</i>

1183
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,219
You will fight these
English philistines, and you'll win.

1184
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:49,091
And even if you lose--
if you go to prison--

1185
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,256
you'll always be my son.

1186
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,665
Of course, it's too late
to change that now.

1187
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,831
If you go, Oscar...

1188
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,338
I'll never speak to you again.

1189
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,672
No one will ever speak
to me again, whatever I do.

1190
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:08,677
<i>Of course I'm your son, Madre...</i>

1191
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:12,014
which is why,
even if I lose...

1192
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,418
the English
will never forget me.

1193
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,016
My darling.

1194
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,622
Get out of my way.
Get out! Out!

1195
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,824
Take me away at once!

1196
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,296
Lady Wilde. Lady Wilde!

1197
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:07,272
Have you anything to say about
your son's disgrace, Lady Wilde?

1198
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,273
<i>Have you anything to say?</i>

1199
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,316
Come in.

1200
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,024
Mr. Wilde, I believe.

1201
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:29,687
Yes, yes.

1202
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:31,992
We have a warrant here
for your arrest...

1203
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,001
on a charge
of committing indecent acts.

1204
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,205
<i>I recommend Switzerland
as soon as possible.</i>

1205
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:48,146
You will have to change
your name, of course.

1206
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:51,846
I can't.

1207
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,513
My dear Constance,
the name of Wilde will be...

1208
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,714
a word of execration
for the next thousand years.

1209
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:00,419
You can't possibly let your boys grow up
with people knowing who they are.

1210
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,392
Think of their lives at school.

1211
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:04,929
Thank you for your advice.

1212
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,461
I'm sorry our friendship
has to end like this.

1213
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:12,733
- Oh, you will always be my friend.
- I am still Oscar's wife.

1214
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,106
That must cease forthwith.
Forthwith. Do you understand?

1215
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:20,009
Anybody who has anything
to do with Oscar from now on...

1216
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:23,048
will never be received
in society again--

1217
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:24,445
ever.

1218
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:33,754
Oh, God, Ada.
What is going to happen to him?

1219
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,329
That's Oscar Wilde's boy.

1220
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,930
Oscar, you must let me
in the witness box.

1221
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,406
If the jury can only hear
what I have to say--

1222
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,705
Bosie, darling boy.

1223
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,714
As soon as they see you
in all your golden youth...

1224
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,009
and me in all my corruption--

1225
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:00,451
You didn't corrupt me.
I corrupted you, if anything.

1226
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,419
That's not how it will seem.

1227
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,787
But I must have my say.
It's outrageous.

1228
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:08,987
Everyone else has said everything,
anything that came into his head.

1229
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:11,690
But I'm the person
all this is about.

1230
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:14,266
It's me my father wants
to get at, not you.

1231
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,768
It's outrageous
that I can't have my say.

1232
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:21,307
It won't help, Bosie.
It may actually make things worse.

1233
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:25,970
But my father will win.
I can't endure my father winning.

1234
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,977
You must go away, dear boy.

1235
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,678
I couldn't bear for them
to arrest you.

1236
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,085
I can't bear what they're
saying about you in court.

1237
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,163
Jesus Christ.

1238
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,394
Good-bye, Bosie, dear boy.

1239
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,666
Don't let anyone, anything,
ever change your feeling for me...

1240
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,364
change your love.

1241
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,341
- See you next time.
- Time's up, my lord.

1242
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,845
Oscar, never. They never will.
I won't let them.

1243
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,220
<i>You've been a great deal
in the company of Lord Alfred Douglas?</i>

1244
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:15,760
Oh, yes.

1245
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:20,291
- Did he read his poems to you?
- Yes.

1246
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:23,700
So, you can perhaps
understand that...

1247
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,136
some of his verses...

1248
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:31,712
would not be acceptable to a reader
with an ordinary balance to mind?

1249
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:34,444
I'm not prepared to say.

1250
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:37,709
It's a question of taste
and temperament...

1251
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,945
and individuality.

1252
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,080
I should say that one man's poetry
is another man's poison.

1253
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,590
Yes, I daresay.

1254
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:48,251
But in this poem
by Lord Alfred Douglas...

1255
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,728
''Two Loves''...

1256
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:52,696
there is one love,
true love...

1257
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:56,496
which-- and I quote--

1258
01:32:56,671 --> 01:33:00,300
''fills the hearts of boy and girl
with mutual flame.''

1259
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:04,638
And, there is another:

1260
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:09,114
''I am the love
that dare not speak its name.''

1261
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,344
Was that poem explained to you?

1262
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:17,788
- I think it's clear.
- There's no doubt as to what it means?

1263
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,517
Most certainly not.

1264
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:22,561
So, is it not clear
that the love described...

1265
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:26,359
relates to natural
and unnatural love?

1266
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:34,967
Then what is the love
that dare not speak its name?

1267
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:51,252
The love that dare not
speak its name...

1268
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:53,950
in this century...

1269
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,620
is such a great affection...

1270
01:33:56,764 --> 01:34:00,200
of an elder for a younger man...

1271
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:02,802
as there was between
David and Jonathan...

1272
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:07,704
such as Plato made
the very basis of his philosophy...

1273
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,538
and such as you may find in
the sonnets of Michelangelo...

1274
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,145
and Shakespeare.

1275
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:19,977
It is, in this century,
misunderstood--

1276
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:23,613
so much misunderstood
that it may be described as...

1277
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:26,488
the love that dare not
speak its name.

1278
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:30,256
And, on account of it,
I am placed where I am now.

1279
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,059
It is beautiful.
It is fine.

1280
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:38,871
It is the noblest form
of affection.

1281
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,532
There's nothing unnatural
about it.

1282
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:46,978
It is intellectual...

1283
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:50,880
and it repeatedly exists
between an elder and a younger man...

1284
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:54,783
when the elder has intellect...

1285
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,389
and the younger man...

1286
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,121
has all the joy, hope
and glamour of life before him.

1287
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:08,867
That it should be so,
the world does not understand.

1288
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,061
The world mocks at it...

1289
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:15,302
and sometimes puts one
in the pillory for it.

1290
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:37,188
The crime of which
you have been convicted...

1291
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:39,391
is so bad...

1292
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,799
that I shall pass
the severest sentence...

1293
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:46,168
that the law will allow.

1294
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:51,074
In my judgment, it is totally
inadequate for such a case as this.

1295
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:55,373
It is the worst case
I have ever tried!

1296
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:58,213
The sentence of the court...

1297
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:00,580
is that you will be imprisoned...

1298
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:03,953
<i>and held to hard labor...</i>

1299
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:06,754
<i>- Stand aside, please.
- for two years.</i>

1300
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,758
- Shame.
- Pervert.

1301
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:15,529
Pervert!

1302
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:24,507
Shame on you!

1303
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:46,523
Disgusting!

1304
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:15,558
<i>A slim thing,
gold-haired like an angel...</i>

1305
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,063
<i>stands always at my side.</i>

1306
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:21,965
<i>He moves in the gloom
like a white flower.</i>

1307
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:26,505
<i>I thought but to defend him from
his father. I thought of nothing else.</i>

1308
01:37:42,957 --> 01:37:45,585
<i>Now my life seems
to have gone from me.</i>

1309
01:37:45,759 --> 01:37:48,057
<i>I'm caught in a terrible net.</i>

1310
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:50,925
<i>But so long as I think
he is thinking of me--</i>

1311
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:55,558
<i>my sweet rose, my delicate flower,
my lily of lilies--</i>

1312
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:59,764
<i>it is in prison that I shall
test the power of love.</i>

1313
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:03,071
<i>I shall see if I can't make
the bitter waters sweet...</i>

1314
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,577
<i>by the intensity of the love
I bear you.</i>

1315
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:23,459
<i>He asked me not to change.
Those were his last words to me--</i>

1316
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:25,588
''Don't change.''

1317
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:29,294
Well, things are going to have
to change when he comes out.

1318
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,666
He'll have no money at all.

1319
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:35,401
- So you're blaming me, too, are you?
- I'm not blaming anyone.

1320
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:39,171
Bosie, you're not the only person
on this earth Oscar cares about.

1321
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:43,373
You've always hated me,
Robbie...

1322
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:46,885
because Oscar loved and still loves me
when you were just one of his boys.

1323
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,597
I'm suffering just as much
as he is, you know.

1324
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,197
My life's ruined too.

1325
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:07,807
I'm much younger than he is. I've hardly
had any life, and it's ruined already.

1326
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:11,639
When Oscar gets out,
we'll live together properly.

1327
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:15,509
We'll take a villa
somewhere near here-- Posilipo...

1328
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:18,311
- or Ischia.
- Or Capri.

1329
01:39:20,421 --> 01:39:22,821
I'll take care of him.

1330
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:25,323
I'll give him
everything he wants.

1331
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,686
I love him, Robbie.

1332
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:33,656
Oscar's mine,
and I'm going to have him.

1333
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:55,252
<i>''Years went over, and the giant
grew very old and very feeble.</i>

1334
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:59,324
<i>He couldn't play about anymore,
so he sat in a huge armchair...</i>

1335
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,088
<i>and watched the children at their games
and admired his garden.</i>

1336
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:10,226
<i>'I have many beautiful flowers, '
he said.</i>

1337
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:14,171
<i>'But the children are
the most beautiful flowers of all. '''</i>

1338
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:55,107
I'm afraid Cyril has got
some idea why you're here.

1339
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:59,116
I'm sending him
to school in Germany.

1340
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:04,355
I can't manage them on my own.

1341
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:10,892
Your back isn't better then?

1342
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:12,896
No, not really.

1343
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:17,101
I may have to have an operation.

1344
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:22,600
What I've done
to you and the boys--

1345
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,608
I can't--

1346
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:27,611
I shall never forgive myself.

1347
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,778
If we could choose
our natures--

1348
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:37,416
If we could only choose.

1349
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:39,355
But it's no use.

1350
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:46,263
Whatever our natures are,
we must fulfill them...

1351
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,727
or our lives-- my life--

1352
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:53,295
would have been filled
with dishonesty.

1353
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:58,542
Even more dishonesty
than there actually was.

1354
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,317
I've always loved you,
Constance.

1355
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,946
You must believe me.

1356
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:14,683
I don't see
how you can have done--

1357
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:16,659
not truly.

1358
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:19,662
Not if all the time--

1359
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,357
I didn't know.

1360
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,770
''Know thyself,''
I used to say.

1361
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:31,267
I didn't know myself.

1362
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,744
I didn't know.

1363
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,484
I suppose you want a divorce.

1364
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:44,480
You have every reason.

1365
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:51,529
I've been thinking,
when you do come out--

1366
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:54,463
when they let you out--
you can go to Switzerland or Italy...

1367
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:57,468
write another play,
get yourself back.

1368
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:01,230
You can.

1369
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,139
You're so clever.
You can.

1370
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:16,880
I don't want a divorce.

1371
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:24,125
Will you ever let me
see the children again?

1372
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:27,060
Of course.

1373
01:43:34,408 --> 01:43:36,239
But there must be one condition:

1374
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,578
Oscar, you must never
see Bosie again.

1375
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,582
If I saw Bosie now,
I'd kill him.

1376
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:54,988
The children love you, Oscar.

1377
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:06,431
They'll always love you.

1378
01:44:15,315 --> 01:44:17,749
Did anyone tell you?

1379
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:20,444
<i>They've been performing
Salome in Paris.</i>

1380
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:33,263
<i>''The giant hastened across the grass
and came near to the child.</i>

1381
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:36,095
<i>And when he came quite close,
his face grew red with anger.</i>

1382
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:40,673
<i>And he said,
'Who hath dared to wound thee?'</i>

1383
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:44,004
<i>For on the palms of the child's hands
were the prints of two nails.</i>

1384
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:46,944
<i>And the prints of two nails
were on his little feet.</i>

1385
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:07,396
<i>'Who hath dared to wound thee?'
cried the giant.</i>

1386
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,198
<i>'Tell me, that I may take
my big sword and slay him. '</i>

1387
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:13,601
<i>'Nay, 'answered the child.</i>

1388
01:45:13,707 --> 01:45:16,073
<i>'For these are
the wounds of love. '''</i>

1389
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:27,109
Bosie thinks I'm jealous.

1390
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:29,313
I think it will come as a shock
to Bosie to realize...

1391
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:32,324
that even he is relatively unimportant
in the scheme of things.

1392
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:36,485
But, no doubt, Bosie will be
remembered as long as Oscar...

1393
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:38,257
unfortunately.

1394
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:45,635
I sometimes wonder...

1395
01:45:48,775 --> 01:45:50,606
if I hadn't...

1396
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,976
pushed him into--

1397
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,377
Don't.

1398
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,553
Oscar was very lucky
to meet you, Robbie.

1399
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:04,287
Think who else
it might have been.

1400
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,654
Oh, I'll have that one.
Thank you.

1401
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:11,629
- Must you go abroad again at once?
- I shouldn't be here now.

1402
01:46:14,468 --> 01:46:17,494
But has he got anywhere to go
when he's released?

1403
01:46:17,604 --> 01:46:19,401
It'll have to be in France.

1404
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:22,269
I'm going to see
what I can arrange.

1405
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:24,637
But here...

1406
01:46:24,745 --> 01:46:26,770
when he leaves prison--

1407
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,880
- Good-bye, Mr. Harris.
- Good-bye, sir.

1408
01:46:34,988 --> 01:46:37,354
Good-bye, Mr. Snow.
Thank you.

1409
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,592
My dear Sphinx.

1410
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:50,500
How marvelous of you to know what hat
to wear at 7:00 in the morning...

1411
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:53,571
to meet a friend
who's been away.

1412
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:56,607
- No, I'll keep this.
- What is it.

1413
01:46:56,777 --> 01:46:59,371
It's a letter to Bosie
telling him...

1414
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:01,708
how I love him
but can never see him again.

1415
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:04,682
I'm going to ask Robbie
to have it copied out before I send it.

1416
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:08,184
I rather fear Bosie
might throw it on the fire.

1417
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:11,586
<i>I call it De Profundis.
It comes from the very depths.</i>

1418
01:47:46,827 --> 01:47:49,227
<i>''I know not whether laws
be right...</i>

1419
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:51,762
<i>or whether laws be wrong.</i>

1420
01:47:51,898 --> 01:47:54,025
<i>All that we know
who lie in jail...</i>

1421
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:56,295
<i>is that the wall is strong...</i>

1422
01:47:56,403 --> 01:47:59,531
<i>and that each day
is like a year--</i>

1423
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,005
<i>a year whose days are long.</i>

1424
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:10,341
<i>Yet each man kills
the thing he loves.</i>

1425
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,816
<i>By each, let this be heard.</i>

1426
01:48:12,953 --> 01:48:14,853
<i>Some do it with a bitter look...</i>

1427
01:48:15,021 --> 01:48:18,081
<i>some with a flattering word.</i>

1428
01:48:18,191 --> 01:48:20,625
<i>The coward does it
with a kiss...</i>

1429
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,126
<i>the brave man with a sword.</i>

1430
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:28,230
<i>Some kill their love
when they are young...</i>

1431
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:31,099
<i>and some when they are old.</i>

1432
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:34,570
<i>Some strangle
with the hands of lust...</i>

1433
01:48:34,674 --> 01:48:37,404
<i>some with the hands of gold.</i>

1434
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:40,410
<i>The kindest use a knife...</i>

1435
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:43,811
<i>because the dead
so soon grow cold. ''</i>

1436
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:54,858
I'm sure we can find
an hotel near here.

1437
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:00,356
Somewhere where you can work.

1438
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:11,769
- I've decided to see him again, Robbie.
- Yes.

1439
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:15,976
- I thought you might.
- I've nothing left.

1440
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:19,517
I've lost my wife.

1441
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,712
I've lost my children.

1442
01:49:23,657 --> 01:49:25,488
They won't allow me
to see them now.

1443
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,023
No one will ever read
my plays or books again.

1444
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:30,753
Yes, they will.

1445
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:33,923
Bosie loves me more
than he loves anyone else...

1446
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:38,497
as much as he can love...

1447
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:41,472
and allow himself to be loved.

1448
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:47,611
I think we need
some more wine.

1449
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:53,812
I find that alcohol...

1450
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,411
taken in
sufficient quantities--

1451
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:03,752
Can bring about
all the effects of drunkenness.

1452
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,532
<i>''Life cheats us with shadows.</i>

1453

<i>We ask it for pleasure.
It gives it to us...</i>

1454
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:55,611
<i>with bitterness
and disappointment in its train.</i>

1455
01:50:55,749 --> 01:50:58,877
<i>And we find ourselves looking
with dull heart of stone...</i>

1456

<i>at the tress
of gold-flecked hair...</i>

1457
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:03,815
<i>that we had once
so wildly worshipped...</i>

1458
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:06,050
<i>and so madly kissed. ''</i>

1459

<i>In this world, there are
only two tragedies.</i>

01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:48,596
<i>One is not getting
what one wants.</i>

1461
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:51,364
<i>The other is getting it.</i>
