1
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:52,877
What?

2
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,251
I said...

3
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,183
I want to teII you my story.

4
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,256
What the heII?

5
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,193
Why are you taIking Iike that?

6
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,324
Who the fuck are you?

7
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,101
My...

8
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,643
name is...

9
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,008
Oh...

10
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,315
Dae-su.

11
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,055
Stop fIirting with his girIfriend.

12
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,518
HoId on.

13
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,087
-Mr. Oh Dae-su!
-Was I fIirting with her? Was I?

14
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,460
Okay! Okay!

15
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,731
Sit down, Oh Dae-su. You're way too drunk.

16
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,375
I need to piss first.

17
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,211
I wasn't even fIirting!

18
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,612
Motherfucker!

19
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,252
AsshoIe!

20
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,382
Sit down!

21
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:05,925
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,386
Fuck, I reaIIy need to piss.

23
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,433
-Isn't she cute?
-Very. Now sit down.

24
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,092
It's my daughter's birthday today.

25
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,271
I got her a birthday present.

26
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,408
A little cloud floating in the sky

27
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,945
A pleasure boat sailing on the river

28
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:30,073
My name, Oh Dae-su, means...

29
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,177
''getting through one day at a time.''

30
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,517
That's what ''Oh Dae-su'' means.

31
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,524
But, God...

32
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,431
why can't I get through today?

33
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,022
Let me go!

34
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,801
-Shut the fuck up!
-Let me go!

35
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,814
Let go! Get away from me!

36
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,526
He shouId be Iocked up.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,254
Grab him!

38
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,406
I'II make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause troubIe again.

39
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,543
Have a nice day, Officer.

40
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,671
He's usuaIIy a nice guy.

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,769
Let's go.

42
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,213
I'II come back and see you soon.

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,910
Don't bother. Never come back.

44
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,587
That's up to me, asshoIes.

45
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,315
Hey!

46
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,593
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy.

47
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,825
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy.

48
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,797
Daddy's got a present for my IittIe Yeun-hee.

49
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,494
I'II be home soon with your present,
just wait a bit Ionger....

50
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,604
Let me taIk to her.

51
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,263
-Good girI.
-Give me the phone.

52
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,766
Yeun-hee, Joo-hwan wants a word with you.

53
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,675
You remember Joo-hwan, don't you?
HoId on.

54
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,976
HeIIo, Yeun-hee.

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,675
It's me, Joo-hwan.

56
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,782
So it's your birthday today?

57
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,247
Happy birthday!

58
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,359
I'II buy you a nice treat tomorrow.

59
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,597
HeIIo? Oh, heIIo, Ja-hyun.

60
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,590
I'm sorry. I know it's very Iate.

61
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,096
Dae-su is on his way home.

62
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,372
I'm sorry. Yes?

63
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,164
HoId on. Dae-su, it's your wife.

64
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,171
Dae-su!

65
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,808
Dae-su!

66
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,826
Your wife says you shouId hurry home!

67
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,604
Dae-su, Iet's get going!
Stop messing around!

68
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,912
OLDBOY

69
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,201
Sir, sir.

70
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,439
Wait, come here. Come and taIk to me.

71
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,339
I won't ask you to Iet me go again.

72
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,537
Just teII me why I'm here, pIease.

73
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,044
I have a right to know why.

74
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,483
God, I've aIready been Iocked in here
for two months.

75
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,415
Sir, wait, come here.

76
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,454
Sir, wait. What is this pIace?

77
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:38,654
PIease, sir, just teII me how Iong
I have to stay here.

78
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,660
Sir!

79
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,802
Fuck you!

80
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,231
Come here, you asshoIe!

81
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,774
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,410
I saw your face, asshoIe!
You're dead when I get out!

83
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,478
I'm sorry! I won't swear at you again.

84
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,519
Just teII me how much Ionger.
One month? Two? Three?

85
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,014
Don't go!

86
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,182
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,884
Just teII me how Iong, you son of a bitch!

88
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,031
I said teII me how Iong, you asshoIe!

89
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,432
Son of a bitch!

90
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,032
You fucking asshoIes!

91
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,933
If they had told me then
that it would be 15 years...

92
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,771
would it have been easier to endure?

93
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,848
Or harder?

94
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,185
LAUGH,
AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU.

95
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,086
WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE.

96
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,463
When the music begins, gas is released.

97
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,511
When the gas is released, I fall asleep.

98
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,815
Later on, I found out...

99
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,083
that it was the same Valium gas
that Russian soldiers used...

100
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,391
on Chechen terrorists.

101
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,428
When I wake up, my hair is cut.

102
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,499
I don't really like the style.

103
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,743
However, they change my clothes...

104
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,202
and clean the room.

105
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,776
Generous bastards.

106
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,043
One!

107
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,879
Two!

108
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,218
Three!

109
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,585
It's too spicy.

110
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,232
I don't want spinach. You eat it.
I won't eat spinach.

111
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,336
Mrs. Kim Ja-hyun's body was found
with stab wounds to the neck.

112
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,408
This was a cold-blooded murder.

113
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,980
As nothing of value was taken...

114
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,674
police suspect the motive was personal.

115
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,080
The victim's husband, Oh Dae-su...

116
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,278
disappeared a year ago and is still at large.

117
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,653
Witnesses say
Oh Dae-su was a heavy drinker...

118
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,249
who fought constantly with his wife.

119
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,755
Neighbors also frequently argued
with Oh Dae-su.

120
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,993
Blood samples found at the scene
match those of Oh Dae-su.

121
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:33,236
Oh Dae-su's fingerprints have been
matched to those found on a glass.

122
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:38,777
Sources claim that Oh Dae-su
definitely visited his wife recently.

123
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,943
The only missing item...

124
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,450
was a family album,
which supports the police theories.

125
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,077
After three years...

126
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,250
many wrinkles form on a man's face.

127
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:40,537
If you stand
outside a phone booth on a rainy day...

128
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,408
and meet a man whose face
is hidden by a violet umbrella...

129
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,939
my advice is...

130
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,675
that you make friends with television.

131
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,149
The television is both clock and calendar.

132
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,045
It is your school, home...

133
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,991
church...

134
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,884
friend...

135
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,153
and lover.

136
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,456
But....

137
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,779
But...

138
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,384
my lover's song...

139
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,789
is too short.

140
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:46,236
Today at 7.:50 am,
the middle of Seoul's Songsu Bridge...

141
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,739
fifty meters long, suddenly collapsed....

142
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,409
I wrote a list...

143
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,445
of all the people I had offended,
quarreled with, and hurt.

144
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,116
This was both my prison journal...

145
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,679
and the autobiography of my evil deeds.

146
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,992
I thought I had lived a normal life...

147
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,724
but there was too much wrongdoing.

148
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,943
All I could think at that moment...

149
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,514
was that the man in the next room...

150
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,913
probably only had one chopstick.

151
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,478
But....

152
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,679
But....

153
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,390
Who had imprisoned me?

154
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,863
Was it Yoo Heung-sam?

155
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,798
Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?

156
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,800
Whoever it was, wait.

157
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,544
Just you wait.

158
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,741
I'll rip your body limb from limb...

159
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,884
and your remains will never be found.

160
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,684
Because I will swallow every last bit.

161
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,912
One line for each year.

162
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,350
When I start doing this,
I am already six lines behind.

163
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,281
So next year will be easier.

164
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,324
The more tattoos I have,
the shorter the chopstick becomes.

165
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,997
The shorter the chopstick becomes...

166
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,728
the bigger the hole in the wall becomes.

167
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,239
Anyway...

168
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,671
time passes well.

169
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,673
Nine years.

170
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,783
Ten years.

171
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,568
Eleven years.

172
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,239

Thirteen years.

181
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,938
ROH MOO-HYUN ELECTED PRESIDENT

182
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,277
Fourteen years.

183
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,136
I'll be out in a month.

184
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,016
I'll be out in just one month.

185
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,915
I'll be out. I'll be out in one month's time.

186
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,680
I'll be out of here.

187
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:59,623
I'll be out in a month. In exactly one month.

188
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,659
I'll need money when I get out,
so what should I do?

189
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,426
Should I steal or rob?

190
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,896
What shall I eat first?
Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel?

191
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,229
Anything but fried dumplings.

192
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,842
But where am I?

193
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,477
With all the car horns, it must be the city.

194
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:23,006
The most important thing
is what floor I'm on.

195
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,777
What if I break through the wall
and I'm on the 52nd floor?

196
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,079
Even if I plunge to my death,
I'll still be getting out.

197
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:36,291
I'm getting out.
In one month, I'm getting out.

198
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,955
Picture yourseIf...

199
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,685
Iying in a fieId.

200
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,299
When you hear the beII...

201
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,626
you wiII turn your head...

202
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,994
and Iook down.

203
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,408
You wiII see...

204
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,443
an endIess fieId of green grass.

205
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,211
The sun is shining brightly.

206
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,445
There's a cool breeze.

207
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,643
It's a human being.

208
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,944
Don't stop me!

209
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,120
Mister!

210
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,357
Even though...

211
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,123
I'm no better than a beast...

212
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,908
don't I have the right to Iive?

213
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,710
Even though...

214
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,180
I'm no better...

215
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,045
than a beast...

216
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,490
don't I have the right...

217
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,964
to Iive?

218
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,127
Yes?

219
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,600
Yes.

220
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,719
The alley with the phone booth
was just here.

221
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,195
Now there's an apartment building.

222
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:37,125
So he releases me onto the roof.
What a fool.

223
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,997
I want to teII you my story.

224
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,238
Die Iater.

225
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:44,969
What?

226
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,886
What the heII?

227
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,617
I see.

228
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,662
Now I'II teII you my story.

229
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,031
The reason...

230
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,338
I want to die is....

231
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,236
Hey, mister!

232
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,575
That's a female human being.

233
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,140
Laugh...

234
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,883
and the world laughs with you.

235
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,844
Weep...

236
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,514
and you weep alone.

237
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,019
My home is gone.

238
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,797
I cannot call my friends or relatives...

239
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,235
because they say I murdered my wife.

240
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,331
I am a fugitive.

241
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,733
You dickshit!

242
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:02,978
Dickshit.

243
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,715
A new word.

244
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,549
Television doesn't teach you swear words.

245
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,828
Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training...

246
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,162
be put to use?

247
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,673
Apparently, it can.

248
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,545
Rock bream.

249
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,749
OpIegnathus fasciatus.

250
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,351
Lives in the warm waters of coastal reefs.

251
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,125
This fish has weak reflexes...

252
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,764
but can resist powerfully
when caught on a hook.

253
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,432
In the Kyongsang Province, its offspring....

254
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,097
What is that smell?

255
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:15,511
Don't bother asking me any questions.

256
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,287
I don't know anything.

257
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,531
Yes?

258
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:44,107
I said I want to eat something aIive.

259
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,520
Oh, right.

260
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,490
Long time, no see.

261
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,854
This is my first time here.

262
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,419
Maybe I'm wrong.

263
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,389
But she looks familiar.

264
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,264
You Iook very famiIiar.

265
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,268
Have we met before?

266
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,204
Search for the Best Chef.

267
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,404
Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC.

268
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,044
''The youngest femaIe chef
of Japanese cuisine.''

269
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,506
Oh, that?

270
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,217
They said the ratings are Iow,
but someone must watch it.

271
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,011
Women's hands are usuaIIy warm,
so they cannot make sushi.

272
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,883
WeII, you certainIy know your stuff.

273
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,503
Who are you?

274
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,235
Do you...

275
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,402
like your clothes?

276
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,113
Why?

277
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,979
Why did you imprison me?

278
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,719
Who do you think I am?

279
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,829
-Yoo Heung-sam?
-Wrong.

280
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,524
-Did Lee So-young pay you?
-Wrong again.

281
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,599
Lee Jong-yong?

282
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,768
Kang Chang-suk?

283
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,971
Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung?

284
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,706
Park Jin-woo?

285
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,071
Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran?

286
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,441
-Who the heII are you?
-Me?

287
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,111
I'm a sort of scholar.

288
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,648
And my field of study is you.

289
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,589
A scholar studying Oh Dae-su.

290
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,189
An expert on Oh Dae-su.

291
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,924
Who I am isn't important.
What's important is why.

292
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,560
Think hard.

293
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,992
Study your whole lifetime.

294
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,663
School has finished,
now it's time for your homework, isn't it?

295
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,140
Keep this in mind.:

296
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,476
''Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock...

297
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,307
''in water they both sink alike. ''

298
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,177
Let me ask you one thing.

299
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,445
You hypnotized me in there, didn't you?

300
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,556
What did you do to me?

301
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,885
I miss you.

302
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,761
Come quickly.

303
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,636
Here you are.

304
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,912
It's aIive, okay?

305
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,747
Now can I sIice it up for you?

306
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:12,420
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very coId.

307
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,687
Why is she doing this?

308
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,393
Sir.

309
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,136
Sir, wake up.

310
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,200
Keep this in mind.

311
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,535
''Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock...

312
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,244
''in water they both sink alike. ''

313
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,017
Are you awake?

314
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,233
Is aII this true?

315
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,454
That fever remedy works weII.

316
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:27,125
Why did you faint if you've done
so much physicaI training?

317
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:34,172
A Iack of vitaI sunIight Ieaves one
depIeted of vitamins A and E.

318
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,978
Thus, one's immunity to infIuenza
is weakened.

319
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,939
Do you aIways taIk Iike that?

320
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,925
The Iock on the bathroom door is broken.

321
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,861
Don't get any bright ideas...

322
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,661
or I'II gut you Iike a fish.

323
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,029
What's this?

324
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:12,401
Suppositories. You fainted,
so how eIse couId I give you medicine?

325
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,990
Can 15 years' worth of
imaginary training be put to use?

326
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,096
Apparently not.

327
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,118
That was an unforgivabIe sin.

328
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,799
I brought you back here
and then turned you down.

329
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,430
I can see why you're angry.

330
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,836
I reaIIy can.

331
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,042
You know,
I brought you here because I Iike you.

332
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,180
But...

333
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,415
you don't even know my name yet.

334
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,450
It's Mi-do.

335
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,182
You see...

336
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,159
Iater on...

337
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,629
when I'm reaIIy ready...

338
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,858
I swear on my Iife that I'II go through with it.

339
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:47,970
That song in your diary,
The Face I Want to See, that wiII be the sign.

340
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,007
When I sing it...

341
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,808
get ready.

342
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,177
I may try to resist you again...

343
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:01,685
in the heat of the moment.

344
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,454
But no matter what, don't stop.

345
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,923
Just give it to me!

346
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,155
Give it...

347
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,292
to me.

348
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,770
The ants...

349
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,507
do you stiII see them?

350
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,203
Do you stiII feeI that way?

351
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,279
Yeah, if you're aIone, you see ants.

352
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,489
PeopIe I have met who are very IoneIy
have aII haIIucinated about ants.

353
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,054
I tried once to work out why.

354
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,890
Ants move around in groups, you know.

355
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,433
So I suppose very IoneIy peopIe
keep thinking of ants.

356
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,440
AIthough I have never done that.

357
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,062
She called from overseas
five or six years ago...

358
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,740
asking if her dad had come back.

359
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,103
She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother.

360
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:12,075
She has hardIy any reIatives,
so she caIIs us.

361
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,750
Her Korean has gotten worse.

362
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,558
I think her Swedish foster parents
are both doctors.

363
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,220
You journaIists must know.

364
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,393
Dae-su...

365
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,703
is he reaIIy stiII on the run?

366
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,938
Your daughter's address is on the front...

367
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,941
and on the back is a map of
your wife's grave.

368
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,911
EVA VON LJUNGBERG
STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN

369
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,077
Eva.

370
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,083
Stockholm.

371
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,049
Eva.

372
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,815
Do you want to caII her?

373
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,726
ShaII I caII her?

374
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,600
ShaII we visit the grave tomorrow?

375
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,946
No, first I have to kill that bastard.

376
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,179
BLUE DRAGON

377
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,580
WeII?

378
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,718
I haven't tasted it yet.

379
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,583
BLUE DRAGON

380
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,384
So?

381
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,490
Did it taste the same?

382
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,474
I could taste food from 100 restaurants...

383
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:29,110
but I will never forget
the food I tasted for 15 years.

384
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,022
BLUE DRAGON

385
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,083
ShaII I create an ID for you,
so you can Iog in?

386
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,050
Do you have a favorite fiIm or song?

387
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:08,754
I've aIready been taIking...

388
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,252
to him.

389
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,896
The Count of Monte Cristo?

390
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:27,710
There's no one by that name here.

391
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,316
How's Iife in a bigger prison, Oh Dae-su?

392
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:41,426
Who are you?

393
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:47,532
Who are you?

394
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,759
The IoneIy prince in the high tower.

395
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,195
Who is he?

396
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,275
I don't know who he is.
I just chat to him sometimes.

397
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,180
We taIk about sushi.

398
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,518
Where are you going?

399
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,232
Where are you going?

400
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,836
I can't trust you.

401
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,615
VIOL

402
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:44,711
BLUE DRAGON

403
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:49,726
Violet Blue Dragon. What does that mean?

404
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:04,469
Why did they order
from a place so far away?

405
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:09,405
I've already passed five Chinese restaurants.

406
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,146
I think my lungs are
on the verge of exploding.

407
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,783
You there, teII your cooks...

408
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,962
to put Iess scaIIions in the dumpIings.

409
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,357
Okay.

410
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,512
-Leave it there and go.
-Yes, sir.

411
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:22,585
We don't take on anyone
who uses bodyguards.

412
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:25,555
Some companies speciaIize in that.

413
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,952
You shouId go to them.

414
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,423
We just take the smaII fry.

415
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:36,155
If the stay is over six months,
transportation is free.

416
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,793
Yes, of course.

417
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,701
Why did you imprison me, you...

418
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,446
dickshit.

419
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,086
In our business on fIoor 7.5...

420
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,419
cIient confidentiaIity is our IiveIihood.

421
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,271
I am going to avenge myseIf for aII 15 years.

422
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,741
Each tooth I extract
wiII age you by one year.

423
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,922
Keep stiII.

424
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,135
Do you want to taIk?

425
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,233
I don't know.

426
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:19,096
I didn't see his face.

427
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,932
I made recordings.

428
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,048
OH DAE-SU

429
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,659
AII those who are bIood type AB,
raise your hand.

430
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,908
Go. Shoo! He has Iost a Iot of bIood.

431
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:02,731
Piece of shit.

432
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,205
Is he dead?

433
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,590
I can't seem to...

434
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,350
get through today, either.

435
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:42,363
Now I have become a monster.

436
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,927
When my vengeance is over...

437
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,098
can I return to being Oh Dae-su?

438
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,880
Mister, are you aIright?

439
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,546
Look at aII this bIood.

440
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:03,948
What happened to you?

441
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,588
Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am,
BuiIding 8. Take care of him.

442
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,492
Thank you.

443
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,297
Not at aII.

444
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,998
WeII, then...

445
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:22,870
fareweII, Oh Dae-su.

446
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,138
Farewell...

447
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,813
Oh Dae-su.

448
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,578
Farewell.

449
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:36,717
Farewell.

450
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,905
The bastard you hate, but don't dare kill.

451
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,676
The bitch you detest,
who deserves a fate worse than death.

452
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,375
We are at your service.

453
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:44,984
Won't he go crazy
if he's locked up for a long time?

454
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:49,992
Well, if you don't want that,
we can drug his drinks.

455
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,026
There's a thing called ''Risperdal solution. ''

456
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:56,792
It's a reliable drug
used to treat schizophrenia.

457
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,834
But it depends on the length
of the treatment...

458
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,770
so how long will he....

459
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,103
Fifteen years.

460
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,572
Is that possible?

461
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,537
What did he do?

462
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:12,913
Oh Dae-su, you see...

463
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,177
talks too much.

464
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,217
Go to sIeep.

465
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,819

00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,167
Joo-hwan.

468
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,819
Oh Dae-su, you see...

469
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,259
talks too much.

470
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,055
Have you heard this voice before?

471
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,669
Who do you think hates me this much?

472
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,505
Those 260 women you've had....

473
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:19,783
No way to remember the names

00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,637
If I met anyone suspicious...

499
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,581
I would invent a secret,
only known to the two of us.

500
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:03,650
That ID, Monster,
is a trap I designed to catch him.

501
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:08,085
You Iet a stranger into your home.
Who the heII are you?

502
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,192
Who's Evergreen?

503
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:31,176
I tracked down that Evergreen ID
and found the owner's details.

504
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,307
-Are you ready to jot it down?
-Go ahead.

505
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,980
It's Su Dae-oh.
Does the surname 'Su' even exist?

506
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:40,421
-Address?
-Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am.

507
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,286
Building 7, flat 407.

508
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,124
Actually, life in a bigger prison...

509
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,693
does not suit me very well.

510
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:11,883
Evergreen.

511
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,223
Who are you?

512
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,129
Is that what you wanted to ask?

513
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:26,003
No. You must find that out for yourseIf.

514
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,593
Come on, it's a game.

515
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,406
First who, then why.

516
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:35,237
When you know the answer,
come and see me.

517
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,472
I'II mark your work.

518
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,073
You have untiI JuIy 5.

519
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,111
Oh no, onIy five days Ieft.

520
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,420
Too short?

521
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,653
Chin up.

522
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:53,255
If you succeed,
I'II kiII myseIf instead of Mi-do.

523
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,399
That's right, Mi-do.

524
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:00,359
I'm going to kiII...

525
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:03,139
every woman you Iove untiI you die.

526
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,073
WeII, you're notorious...

527
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:09,442
for not protecting your women anyway.

528
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:19,320
Wow, you're strong, Mr. Monster.

529
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,915
Yes, you are the monster that I created.

530
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:26,719
But you wiII never...

531
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,496
find out why if you go through with this.

532
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,564
You have been curious for 15 years.

533
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:34,804
Are you stiII going to kiII me?

534
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,110
Sit down there.

535
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,248
Ah, the tooth torture!

536
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:59,125
You won't have enough time.

537
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,962
I have a pacemaker for my weak heart.

538
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,432
When it was put in...

539
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,431
do you know what I said to the doctor?

540
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,375
''Dr. Hopkins...

541
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,071
''give me...

542
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,913
''a remote controI to turn my motor off.''

543
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,650
''Pardon? Why?''

544
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,357
''So that I can kiII myseIf easiIy. At any time.

545
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:33,324
''I'II pay you an extra $100,000 for this.''

546
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,903
What a diIemma.

547
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:52,807
You want to kiII me right now...

548
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,380
but then you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

549
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,282
You want to torture me,
but I say I'II kiII myseIf first.

550
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:06,251
Revenge? Or the truth?

551
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,564
What a probIem for you.

552
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:14,905
I've been watching over you for 15 years.

553
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,538
I've fared weII, thanks to you.

554
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:22,976
I wasn't bored or IoneIy.

555
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:29,446
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who has been hurt.

556
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,043
Try it.

557
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,786
The Ioss of 15 years...

558
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,087
the pain of Iosing your wife and chiId...

559
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,797
aII this can be forgotten.

560
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:45,725
Once again, revenge is good for your heaIth.

561
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,295
But...

562
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,173
what happens
after you've had your revenge?

563
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:55,975
I bet that hidden pain
probabIy emerges again.

564
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,977
Are you there, Oh Dae-su?

565
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,551
Oh Dae-su.

566
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:06,414
Long time no see.

567
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,460
Hasn't she been tied up too Iong?
You Ieft her door open.

568
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:34,942
Save me, Dae-su!

569
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,019
I can't. I'm going to die.

570
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,763
This dentist is very good.

571
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,474
Keep stiII.

572
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,578
Keep stiII.

573
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,473
What's his probIem?

574
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,112
You see...

575
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,412
they say that peopIe...

576
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:42,946
shriveI up because of their imagination.

577
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:47,089
So don' t imagine anything.

578
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,418
You'II become brave as heII.

579
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,523
Now here comes the reaI thing.

580
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:29,594
Sir, I'm gIad you toId me about this pIace...

581
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:33,395
but I haven't even started yet!

582
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:50,779
Let's go.

583
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,138
Let's go now.

584
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,172
Let's fight.

585
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,843
Let's fight.

586
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:22,777
What a tough guy!

587
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,183
Your hand.

588
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:27,089
I'II chop off your hand.

589
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,749
You touched Mi-do's breasts.

590
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:39,059
Let's get out of this dump.

591
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,510
So do you trust me now, you bastard?

592
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,219
It Iooks hard to accompIish.

593
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:04,955
I Iooked into it.

594
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,493
The reason the bank
refused to pay 270 miIIion won...

595
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,227
was not due to any buiIding irreguIarities.

596
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:13,062
They have internaI probIems.

597
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,606
So I don't think we'II have any troubIe.

598
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:25,838
Chairman Choi's 23 cIients' shares
are at 25% ....

599
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,550
Dae-su.

600
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,418
Yeah?

601
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:43,498
Did he reaIIy say that he'd kiII me?

602
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:46,725
Yeah.

603
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,039
Because I'm the woman you Iove?

604
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:57,644
Dae-su.

605
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:00,676
What?

606
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:04,549
Where is my love?

607
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:09,257
I'm getting lonelier in the nights

608
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:16,999
The words you send with your eyes

609
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,995
I can feel with my hand

610
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,864
So many nights have passed

611
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:30,643
My heart is going to you

612
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:35,683
As I shed my sad tears

613
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:40,489
You're the face I miss

614
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:49,324
They packed up their stuff
and Ieft in a rentaI car.

615
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:55,503
AIso, Mi-do caIIed the restaurant
and Ieft her job.

616
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,837
Let's go after this is done.

617
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,706
You shouId get some rest today, sir.

618
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,813
I can't even sIeep.

619
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,745
Because I'm IoneIy.

620
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,217
Mr. Han.

621
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,287
Do you reaIIy think...

622
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,227
that Mi-do has faIIen in Iove
with Oh Dae-su?

623
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:25,869
AIready?

624
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,682
Dae-su!

625
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,292
It hurts so much.

626
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,657
But I'II endure it.

627
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,961
You shouIdn't forget this.

628
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:14,379
How did you hold out for 15 years?

629
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:16,843
There's always a way.

630
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,084
Do you Iike it?

631
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,353
You do Iike it, don't you?

632
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:26,495
I want to make you feeI good, Dae-su.

633
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,188
You need not worry about the future.

634
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,329
Imagine nothing.

635
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,972
I am grateful for all those years
spent in that prison.

636
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:21,574
If I was the old Oh Dae-su,
would Mi-do still have liked me?

637
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:02,909
He could only have known that I said
I would chop off Mr. Park's hand...

638
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,450
by putting a bug on us.

639
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,617
And he knew where we were by tailing us.

640
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,259
I've been bugged. PIease find it.

641

You know...

642
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,293
maybe he freed you...

643
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,828
because he has fun watching you run wild,
seeking revenge.

644
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:25,799
And he'll never tell you why,
so he can toy with you forever.

645
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,339
Couldn't that be why?

LEE WOO-JIN

660
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,308
Joo-hwan?

661
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:44,047
Let me ask you something.

662
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,784
Do you remember Lee Woo-jin from schooI?

663
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,152
I think he went to study in America.

664
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:52,619
Lee Woo-jin?

665
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,122
I don't know him.

666
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,093
So is that the bastard's name?

667
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,233
How did you find out?

668
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:02,566
I Iooked through aII the schooI yearbooks.

669
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,274
I need more than just a name.

670
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,206
Got anything else?

671
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:10,342
Look at the student records.

672
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:13,414
Do you know Lee Soo-ah?
She was in our year.

673
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,042
Lee Soo-ah?

674
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,984
She died.

675
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:20,321
-What cIassroom was she in?
-Room two, I think.

676
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:21,947
She was my classmate.

677
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:23,354
Next to yours.

678
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,025
But what about her?

679
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,324
Why is there no photo?

680
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:32,928
She died. That must be why.

681
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,367
How did Lee Soo-ah die?

682
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,437
Yeah, you wouldn't know.

683
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,669
She died after you transferred.

684
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,673
She went to the Habchun Dam alone
and fell into the water.

685
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,411
She drowned.

686
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:57,050
One week later,
they found her bloated body in the water.

687
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:59,952
-What was she Iike?
-Her?

688
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,497
She was a compIete sIut.

689
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:06,099
On the outside,
she acted Iike a innocent Iady...

690
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,869
but inside, she was just a fiIthy whore.

691
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:14,509
The rumor was going around schooI
that she'd fuck anyone.

692
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,538
I shouId have got in there.

693
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:24,586
I aIso heard that her famiIy was fiIthy rich.

694
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:27,480
Her grades were good, too.

695
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,993
But the worst thing was
that she was a totaI sIut.

696
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:35,187
God, this is such an oId story.

697
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,965
Dae-su, I can't remember
because it was so Iong ago...

698
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:42,027
but that Soo-ah, weII--

699
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,820
Joo-hwan, what is it?

700
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,257
Joo-hwan, is something wrong?

701
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:10,492
Oh Dae-su.

702
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,402
My sister...

703
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,535
was no sIut.

704
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:22,601
You must beIieve that.

705
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:29,341
You got rid of your bug,
so I had to come aII the way here...

706
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,619
to eavesdrop.

707
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,016
That's why Joo-hwan is dead...

708
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,355
because of you.

709
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:40,957
Okay?

710
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:55,444
You bastard, I'm coming for you!

711
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,743
I'm going to kill you!

712
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,805
You son of a bitch!

713
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:46,756
We're not open yet.
Come back in an hour, pIease.

714
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,663
This pIace was recommended
by someone with six goId teeth.

715
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,770
Mr. Park?

716
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:03,809
I had to move because of you.

717
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,447
To ceIebrate the occasion...

718
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,780
I instaIIed a new TV.

719
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,051
Do you Iike it?

720
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:16,358
It's got so many channeIs. Great, isn't it?

721
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:19,156
Some prisoners don't want to Ieave at aII.

722
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:22,794
You Iived in a pIace Iike this
for 15 years, Dae-su?

723
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,795
After 1 1 years it feIt Iike home.

724
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:30,531
Come on, I don't need your money.

725
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,542
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

726
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:41,609
We threw away the hand because it rotted.

727
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:43,350
I've missed you.

728
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:47,781
Bastard. You'II pay for this.

729
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:53,627
So why did you bring me here?

730
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,797
If I don't return after JuIy 5, Iet her go.

731
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:12,340
WhiIe I was Iocked up here,
I remember someone visiting me.

732
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,011
What did that person do?

733
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:16,477
Was it three times?

734
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,715
I put a hypnosis-inducing drug
in your water.

735
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,289
Sodium barbiturate?

736
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:25,785
You're a genius!

737
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,471
WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON

738
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,146
That's nonsense.

739
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,910
Even though it was a CathoIic schooI...

740
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,989
those rumors wouIdn't have kiIIed her.

741
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:57,017
There was probabIy something eIse.

742
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:02,420
CouId she have been pregnant, maybe?

743
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,434
I reaIIy don't think Soo-ah was Iike that.

744
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:10,732
She was such a pure girI.

745
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,740
I know she never went with anyone.

746
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:19,339
But she did go out with someone back then.

747
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,542
Do you want to know who he was?

748
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,884
I haven't got a cIue!

749
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:41,561
Choon-shim.

750
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,304
You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you?

751
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,569
Who was her boyfriend?

752
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:49,105
You don't know?

753
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,446
You siIIy cow.

754
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,408
You don't know...

755
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:55,882
because friendship means nothing to you.

756
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:57,077
Shut up.

757
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:58,978
Who wouId know?

758
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,178
Who?

759
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,683
Joo-hwan?

760
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:07,623
What?

761
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,764
Yeah, I know him.

762
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:14,835
But why wouId he know?

763
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:17,339
Yeah?

764
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,367
ReaIIy?

765
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,575
Okay. I'II caII you back in a bit.

766
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,212
WeII...

767
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:34,154
she said it was Joo-hwan
who toId her the rumors...

768
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:37,317
and that you shouId know
more than anyone.

769
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:54,670
Ring, ring.

770
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:56,638
Move aside.

771
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:01,676
You'll get hurt...

772
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,521
if you get in the way.

773
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:20,064
OH DAE-SU

774
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,416
Good Lord!

775
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,512
You rascaI. Put it out!

776
01:17:40,723 --> 01:17:44,181
I'm Ieaving today for SeouI.

777
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,259
So just you Ieave me aIone, missy.

778
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,396
You good-for-nothing!

779
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,214
You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you?

780
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,587
And you are....

781
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:55,687
I heard you're popuIar with the girIs.

782
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,597
You know what rumors are Iike.

783
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:03,429
I heard you're reaIIy funny. Make me Iaugh.

784
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:09,778
I don't want to be tied to just one image.

785
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:21,916
Okay, there's this father and son.

786
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,816
They went to the swimming pooI and....

787
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:26,655
See you Iater.

788
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:51,718
TAKE CARE,
FUCKHEADS OF YEAR 3, CLASS 3!

789
01:20:52,782 --> 01:20:55,307
-Come on.
-Wait.

790
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,785
-Come here.
-No.

791
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,482
Come here.

792
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,120
Okay, okay.

793
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,296
Satisfied?

794
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:18,265
-Lift this up.
-No way.

795
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:20,306
-Lift it up.
-No.

796
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:36,182
What?

797
01:21:44,834 --> 01:21:46,392
That tickIes.

798
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:16,926
Give me those.

799
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,530
What are you doing?

800
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:25,265
Let me see.

801
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,670
What are you doing?

802
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,567
-Let me see.
-Stop it.

803
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:41,583
Go away.

804
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:26,251
Was it reaIIy Soo-ah? Are you sure?

805
01:24:26,996 --> 01:24:28,657
I don't know her name.

806
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:33,098
I just know that she's in your cIass
and she rides a red bike.

807
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:43,538
Have a good trip. See you in SeouI.

808
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:45,307
Where are you going?

809
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,343
I've got a date with Choon-shim.

810
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,809
I'II kiII you if you bIab to anyone.

811
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,150
No way.

812
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:02,426
You got locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?

813
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:06,725
Is that such a crime?

814
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,434
''Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock...

815
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,803
''in water they both sink alike. ''

816
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:19,639
That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude.

817
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:23,442
So...

818
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,148
what's the significance of JuIy 5?

819
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,982
That's the day...

820
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:33,819
Lee Soo-ah died.

821
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:40,796
It's over now.

822
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:43,665
You were fighting for the truth...

823
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:46,237
not for revenge, weren't you?

824
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:52,439
Now we'II run away
where Woo-jin can never foIIow us.

825
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:58,520
I can't end it like this.

826
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,655
Vengeance has become a part of me.

827
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:09,888
But you don't even know where he Iives.

828
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,192
''Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter...

829
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:17,868
''like a bird from the snare of the fowler...

830
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:19,698
''free yourself. ''

831
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:24,572
It is taken from the
Book of Proverbs, chapter six, verse four.

832
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:26,580
And Evergreen...

833
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,778
said he lives in a high tower.

834
01:26:30,653 --> 01:26:33,053
So six and four...

835
01:26:34,156 --> 01:26:35,555
must be floors.

836
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:38,152
Fourth floor.

837
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:40,660
Sixth floor.

838
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,191
Or the 64th floor?

839
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,125
P?

840
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,032
Penthouse!

841
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:54,273
Please insert the code.

842
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:03,551
What wouId you Iike me to pray for?

843
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,318
Wrong entry.

844
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,048
Please re-enter.

845
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:19,228
Wrong entry. Please re-enter.

846
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,793
''Dear Lord...

847
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:24,495
''pIease Iet me...

848
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:28,401
''meet a younger man next time.''

849
01:28:18,494 --> 01:28:19,984
PIease make Woo-jin...

850
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:23,293
kneeI before Dae-su...

851
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:27,834
and beg for forgiveness.

852
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,280
You sIept with your sister.

853
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,029
Let's go upstairs and taIk.

854
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,613
Get him!

855
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,171
You couId just taIk.

856
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:18,111
That was refreshing.

857
01:30:20,349 --> 01:30:21,839
You sIept with your sister.

858
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:23,818
So refreshing.

859
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:31,783
And I started the rumors.

860
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,358
That's why your sister died.

861
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,669
Looking in the mirror
reminds me of that day.

862
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,742
How about you?

863
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:52,074
Erasing my memory and teIIing me
to find the truth was cowardIy.

864
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,011
I won...

865
01:30:57,453 --> 01:30:59,250
so die Iike you promised.

866
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:03,050
Did you think you had forgotten that
day because you were hypnotized?

867
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:05,582
ReaIIy?

868
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:09,996
Do you know the reaI reason
why you can't remember?

869
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:14,661
It's because...

870
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:20,431
you just forgot.

871
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:23,470
Is that not exciting enough for you?

872
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:27,140
WeII it's true, you just forgot.

873
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:29,951
Why? Because it wasn't important to you.

874
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:33,478
Your rumor got so out of hand...

875
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:36,752
that the next rumor was
that Soo-ah was pregnant.

876
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:39,652
My sister got sucked into that rumor...

877
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:41,725
and began beIieving it.

878
01:31:41,897 --> 01:31:45,560
So her periods stopped
and her beIIy began to sweII.

879
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:48,565
Fascinating, isn't it?

880
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:52,731
Imagine how it wouId feeI for a girI
to carry a chiId who's her own nephew.

881
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,706
Do you understand now?

882
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:59,107
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

883
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,616
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

884
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,178
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

885
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:14,727
Is that why you kiIIed your sister?

886
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,320
Imagine how a boy wouId feeI...

887
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:19,093
fathering both his chiId and his nephew?

888
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:25,139
You were probabIy afraid.

889
01:32:25,274 --> 01:32:28,710
Afraid that everyone wouId know
once the baby was born.

890
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:33,814
After you kiIIed her, you reaIized
it was a phantom pregnancy...

891
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:36,214
so your hating me...

892
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:39,920
is understandabIe.

893
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,487
They said Soo-ah died aIone at the dam...

894
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:50,128
so who took this photo?

895
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,434
And what about the date, JuIy 5?

896
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:03,477
This is no fun.

897
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:06,714
I'II just finish what I was saying.

898
01:33:07,115 --> 01:33:09,948
Listen carefuIIy. My story is reaIIy exciting.

899
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:12,751
Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion?

900
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:15,015
You suggest something during hypnosis...

901
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:17,657
then it's performed in your wakened state.

902
01:33:19,394 --> 01:33:21,294
StiII haven't worked it out?

903
01:33:27,636 --> 01:33:31,128
You Iet a stranger into your home.
Who the heII are you?

904
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,833
What about you, you bastard?

905
01:33:39,014 --> 01:33:41,574
We hypnotized both of you.

906
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:46,712
One fortunate thing was that,
compared to others...

907
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,915
both of you were highly receptive
to hypnosis.

908
01:33:50,993 --> 01:33:52,085
Isn't this fun?

909
01:33:52,394 --> 01:33:56,592
One word gets you pregnant.
Another makes you fall in love.

910
01:33:59,601 --> 01:34:03,435
But no matter how receptive
you two were to hypnosis...

911
01:34:04,006 --> 01:34:06,975
and no matter how good
a hypnotist Miss Yoo is...

912
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:10,173
getting peopIe to faII in Iove isn't easy.

913
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:14,508
Do you know how we did it?

914
01:34:17,686 --> 01:34:20,120
Your first suggestion, of course...

915
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,085
was to go to that restaurant...

916
01:34:22,357 --> 01:34:24,757
straight after your reIease.

917
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:29,391
Next, to react
to the mobiIe phone's ringtone.

918
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:34,492
When you heard this,
you were programmed to say something.

919
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,096
Who are you?

920
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,032
Do you...

921
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,069
Iike your cIothes?

922
01:34:43,445 --> 01:34:46,107
And Mi-do was programmed
to react to the man...

923
01:34:46,214 --> 01:34:48,273
who would say this.

924
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:52,381
When she touched your hand,
your reaction would be, of course....

925
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:59,158
Your gravest mistake wasn't
faiIing to find the answer.

926
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:01,826
If you keep...

927
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:05,696
asking the wrong questions,
you'II never find the right answer.

928
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:10,400
It's not ''Why did Woo-jin imprison me?''

929
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,697
It's ''Why did he reIease me?''

930
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,733
Once again:

931
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:19,604
Why did Woo-jin reIease Dae-su...

932
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,307
after 15 years?

933
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:28,165
Laugh, and the worId Iaughs with you.

934
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,709
Weep, and you weep aIone.

935
01:39:10,745 --> 01:39:11,871
Mr. Han.

936
01:39:20,855 --> 01:39:22,550
Mr. Han!

937
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:04,226
Mi-do.

938
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,068
Mi-do doesn't know, does she?

939
01:40:18,046 --> 01:40:19,911
Why did you hide her there?

940
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:25,349
Did you think he'd hate me
just because I cut off his hand?

941
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,019
Didn't you work out that it was a trap?

942
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:33,317
How can you protect your woman
with that brain?

943
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:38,888
I've secretIy been raising Mi-do
since she was three.

944
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,465
What's wrong with you?

945
01:40:43,338 --> 01:40:45,203
Mr. Park's hand?

946
01:40:46,474 --> 01:40:48,032
You moron.

947
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:53,647
Did you see his new prison?
I gave him that buiIding for his hand!

948
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:54,976
Me!

949
01:41:19,674 --> 01:41:20,902
Dae-su!

950
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,411
In front of me...

951
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:26,742
there's some kind of box.

952
01:41:27,115 --> 01:41:29,174
He's teIIing me to open it.

953
01:41:29,851 --> 01:41:31,512
It's the same vioIet box....

954
01:41:31,686 --> 01:41:32,675
No!

955
01:41:34,622 --> 01:41:36,351
No, Mi-do, don't.

956
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:38,221
Don't open it, no matter what.

957
01:41:38,526 --> 01:41:40,994
Or something terribIe wiII happen.

958
01:41:41,129 --> 01:41:42,323
What's in it?

959
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:44,562
You know, don't you?

960
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:47,157
Mi-do, just wait a IittIe Ionger.

961
01:41:47,902 --> 01:41:51,998
Dae-su wiII be there soon.

962
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,334
I'II be there very soon.

963
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,210
Can't you come now?

964
01:41:59,414 --> 01:42:00,506
I'm scared.

965
01:42:00,882 --> 01:42:03,009
LittIe Mi-do, you can wait, can't you?

966
01:42:03,184 --> 01:42:04,276
Yes.

967
01:42:04,886 --> 01:42:07,650
Very good. Good girI.

968
01:42:08,523 --> 01:42:12,550
I'II caII you back very soon, okay?

969
01:42:27,442 --> 01:42:28,409
PIease.

970
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,538
Don't teII Mi-do.

971
01:42:38,353 --> 01:42:40,184
What has she done wrong?

972
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:45,058
You know it was aII my fauIt.

973
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:49,395
I have...

974
01:42:51,266 --> 01:42:53,530
committed an unforgivabIe sin...

975
01:42:54,402 --> 01:42:56,199
against your sister.

976
01:42:58,072 --> 01:43:00,267
And I aIso...

977
01:43:01,476 --> 01:43:03,034
did you wrong.

978
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:05,907
But...

979
01:43:07,549 --> 01:43:09,483
pIease Ieave Mi-do aIone.

980
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,684
If by any chance...

981
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:20,051
Mi-do finds out the truth...

982
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:22,963
you son of a bitch!

983
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:27,490
I'II tear you...

984
01:43:27,635 --> 01:43:29,398
Iimb from Iimb.

985
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,802
And your remains wiII never be found.

986
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:33,896
Why?

987
01:43:34,275 --> 01:43:36,766
Because I'm going to swaIIow every Iast bit.

988
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:40,571
Woo-jin!

989
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:44,117
PIease, sir, I made a mistake.

990
01:43:44,219 --> 01:43:47,245
PIease forget what I said.

991
01:43:48,122 --> 01:43:49,316
Sir!

992
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:50,985
Woo-jin!

993
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:55,829
We're Evergreen OId Boys, remember?

994
01:43:56,231 --> 01:44:00,065
With the energy

995
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:02,431
Of a green pine tree

996
01:44:05,273 --> 01:44:09,710
The Great Sangnok High....

997
01:44:14,215 --> 01:44:15,978
I'II do whatever you want.

998
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:18,382
I'II do anything. I beg you.

999
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,487
Woo-jin, if you want me to be your dog,
I wiII!

1000
01:44:23,992 --> 01:44:27,553
From this moment on I am Woo-jin's dog!

1001
01:44:27,862 --> 01:44:29,386
I'm your bitch.

1002
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:38,337
Look, I'm wagging my taiI.

1003
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:41,470
I'm a dog. I'II guard your house.

1004
01:44:41,743 --> 01:44:43,973
I'II be your sIave.

1005
01:46:52,173 --> 01:46:53,140
The box...

1006
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,638
just Ieave it cIosed.

1007
01:47:11,626 --> 01:47:12,752
Now...

1008
01:47:15,696 --> 01:47:18,028
what wiII I Iive for?

1009
01:48:22,463 --> 01:48:23,521
Dae-su!

1010
01:48:24,765 --> 01:48:26,494
It hurts so much.

1011
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:29,325
But I'll endure it.

1012
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:32,901
You must understand.

1013
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:56,626
My sister and I Ioved each other
despite everything.

1014
01:49:01,135 --> 01:49:02,727
Can you two do the same?

1015
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:11,106
I want to make you feel good, Dae-su.

1016
01:49:46,714 --> 01:49:47,874
Soo-ah.

1017
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,324
Woo-jin.

1018
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,595
I know you've aIways been afraid.

1019
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:14,006
So just Iet go of me.

1020
01:50:30,925 --> 01:50:32,654
PIease remember me.

1021
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:44,995
I have no regrets. Do you?

1022
01:51:30,651 --> 01:51:33,779
This is the whole adventure
of my life until now.

1023
01:51:34,522 --> 01:51:37,548
Thank you for listening
to this terrible story to the end.

1024
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:42,793
I trust that you will understand
my sending a letter...

1025
01:51:42,897 --> 01:51:46,492
instead of talking to you in person.

1026
01:51:47,268 --> 01:51:48,929
This is because I have no tongue.

1027
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:52,331
To be honest,
there's no reason I shouId heIp you.

1028
01:51:57,945 --> 01:51:59,003
But there was one thing.

1029
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:02,982
I was touched by this Iast sentence.

1030
01:52:04,852 --> 01:52:09,755
Even though I'm no better than a beast...

1031
01:52:09,857 --> 01:52:14,317
don't I have the right to Iive?

1032
01:52:17,131 --> 01:52:19,725
The hypnosis may go wrong
and distort your memories.

1033
01:52:22,002 --> 01:52:23,299
Do you want to proceed?

1034
01:52:44,592 --> 01:52:46,082
If you're ready...

1035
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:50,024
Iook at that tree.

1036
01:53:07,148 --> 01:53:08,137
The tree...

1037
01:53:09,517 --> 01:53:12,384
is sIowIy changing into a concrete piIIar.

1038
01:53:21,128 --> 01:53:24,791
You're now inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse.

1039
01:53:26,267 --> 01:53:27,894
It's a dreary night.

1040
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:33,706
The sound of your footsteps
crossing to the window...

1041
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:35,732
fills the room.

1042
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:53,821
When I ring my bell...

1043
01:53:55,095 --> 01:53:58,064
you'll split into two people.

1044
01:54:02,102 --> 01:54:05,299
One person doesn't know your secret.:
Oh Dae-su.

1045
01:54:06,707 --> 01:54:09,608
The one who knows your secret
is the monster.

1046
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:12,876
When I ring the bell again...

1047
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:15,972
the monster will turn around
and start walking.

1048
01:54:21,455 --> 01:54:24,788
With each step, he will age by one year.

1049
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:30,024
When he reaches 70, the monster will die.

1050
01:54:30,931 --> 01:54:32,489
There's no need to worry.

1051
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,133
It will be a very peaceful death.

1052
01:54:43,844 --> 01:54:45,402
Now, good luck to you.

1053
01:55:28,055 --> 01:55:29,613
What's going on?

1054
01:55:30,891 --> 01:55:32,825
Look at you.

1055
01:56:02,256 --> 01:56:03,883
Who were you with?

1056
01:56:59,646 --> 01:57:01,079
I Iove you...

1057
01:57:02,282 --> 01:57:03,681
Dae-su.
