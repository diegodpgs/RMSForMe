1
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,910
Tanaka-san!

2
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,910
Tanaka-san!

3
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,550
<i>A story like mine
should never be told.</i>

4
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,850
<i>For my world is as forbidden
as it is fragile.</i>

5
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,600
<i>Without its mysteries,
it cannot survive.</i>

6
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,570
<i>I certainly wasn't born
to the life of a geisha.</i>

7
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,320
<i>Like so much in my strange life...</i>

8
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,950
<i>... I was carried there by the current.</i>

9
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,080
<i>The first time I knew
my mother was sick...</i>

10
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,420
<i>... was when my father threw the fish
back into the sea.</i>

11
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,630
<i>That night we went hungry.</i>

12
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,890
<i>"To understand emptiness,"
he told us.</i>

13
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,020
<i>Mother always said my sister Satsu
was like wood.</i>

14
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,020
<i>As rooted to the earth
as a sakura tree.</i>

15
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>But she told me I was like water.</i>

16
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,240
<i>Water can carve its way,
even through stone.</i>

17
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,620
<i>And when trapped,
water makes a new path.</i>

18
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,730
Stop here.

19
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,730
These are the girls from Tanaka?

20
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,150
Sisters, yes, from Yoroido.

21
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,610
This one, maybe.
The other one, no.

22
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,610
- No, no, Chiyo! Chiyo! Chiyo!
- Satsu! Satsu!

23
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,410
- Chiyo!
- Satsu!

24
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,760
Show your respect for Mother.

25
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,680
You must not speak.
I will answer for you.

26
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,020
Kneel.

27
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,900
And head down.
Never look her in the face.

28
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,130
- How old are you?
- She is Year of the Rooster.

29
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,050
Only 9.

30
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,660
Where is my sister?

31
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,790
Let me see those eyes.

32
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,290
Look at me.

33
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,670
Too much water.

34
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,130
<i>But, Okasan, a little water
is good to guard against fire.</i>

35
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,760
<i>You won't have to worry
about the okiya burning...</i>

36
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,100
...losing all your kimono.

37
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,640
These country girls.

38
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,730
Too late to send her back now.

39
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Go.

40
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,250
Pumpkin. Keep her quiet.
Mother is downstairs.

41
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,750
Let me go!

42
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,750
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

43
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,170
- Stop that.
- Let me go!

44
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,090
Mother will hear you.
She's got a bamboo stick.

45
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,970
I want my sister! Satsu!

46
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,730
I cried too at first.

47
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,700
You know, it is easier
if you just forget everything...

48
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,030
<i>...that happened before
you came to the okiya.</i>

49
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,410
If you impress Mother
and do exactly as she says...

50
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,040
...she will send you to school
to be a geisha.

51
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,880
A what?

52
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,210
A geisha. Like Hatsumomo.

53
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,510
<i>You will get to drink sake
and sleep until noon.</i>

54
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,060
Where is my sister?

55
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,980
<i>Probably in another okiya
in the hanamachi.</i>

56
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,020
Your family sold you to this house.

57
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,530
You live here now.

58
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,590
Outside, you wear these.

59
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,260
Inside, these.

60
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,640
We don't display our naked feet
like monkeys.

61
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,180
It's not flesh we're selling here.

62
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,640
This is a geisha house.

63
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,820
<i>Remember to always honor
this okiya.</i>

64
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,440
You listen, you learn.

65
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,530
Now get to work.

66
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,330
Be quiet. Hatsumomo is sleeping.

67
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,830
Pumpkin, when can I go outside?

68
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,590
<i>Outside the okiya?
You can't. It's not allowed.</i>

69
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,920
How will I find Satsu?

70
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,470
<i>You can't just walk up to every house
in the hanamachi.</i>

71
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,310
Do you know how many there are?

72
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,730
Look.

73
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,720
Tighter!

74
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,120
Chiyo. Chiyo-chan.

75
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,420
Come. Two nights ago, Hatsumomo
had to stay at the teahouse until dawn.

76
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,550
That's what she told Mother. But she
was really here with a man the whole...

77
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,260
Why can't you be quiet?

78
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,600
So this is the new arrival.

79
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,340
A pity she still stinks of fish.

80
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,430
Stay out of my room.

81
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,260
Your fingers smell.

82
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,810
I can't have you touching my things.

83
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,790
Only reason Mother tolerates
Hatsumomo...

84
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,830
...is because she brings in
good money.

85
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,040
Never forget.

86
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,880
It is Hatsumomo
who pays for your supper...

87
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,510
...the clothes on your back.

88
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,970
By the time she was 20...

89
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,510
...she had already earned back
her purchase price.

90
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,760
Unheard of.

91
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,140
<i>She has been the talk
of the hanamachi ever since.</i>

92
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,810
These are all hers?

93
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,150
<i>Certainly not.
They belong to the okiya.</i>

94
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,740
A kimono like this,
made of Tatsumura silk...

95
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,540
...it would take a lifetime to earn.

96
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,170
A geisha needs
an elegant wardrobe...

97
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,420
...just like an artist needs ink.

98
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,680
If she's not properly dressed,
then she is not a true geisha.

99
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,010
Nobody told me what a geisha is.

100
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,680
You will find out soon enough.

101
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,180
I have news for you, child.

102
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,690
Mother has determined
it is off to school with you.

103
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,900
You are to become geisha.

104
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,580
Chiyo! Pumpkin!

105
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,540
Quick, quick! Don't be late!

106
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,120
You will be late.

107
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,880
Go. Go.

108
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,550
This way!

109
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,740
Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

110
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,120
Pumpkin! I'm going to run.
I'm going to find Satsu.

111
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,540
No, Chiyo-chan, don't!

112
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
You will ruin your own chances.
And mine too.

113
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,130
Please, stay with me.

114
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,470
Squid. Come on!

115
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,490
Look for your sister's name later.

116
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,920
You are late!

117
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,750
Chiyo! Where is Granny's food?

118
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,580
Where have you been?

119
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,960
It's freezing cold!

120
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,510
Close the window!

121
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,930
<i>- With millions of people unemployed,
on the brink of starvation.</i>

122
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,520
<i>Banking institutions have continued
to suffer in Germany...</i>

123
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
<i>... due to rapid inflation.</i>

124
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,850
<i>Another cause of Germany's suffering
is the constant struggle...</i>

125
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,900
<i>... to pay the heavy burden
of war reparations it's still...</i>

126
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,490
Chiyo! Chiyo, come quickly!

127
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,910
Hatsumomo is at the bathhouse.
Tidy up.

128
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,250
<i>- But she told me to stay out...
- Hatsumomo does not run this okiya.</i>

129
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,670
<i>The Japanese emperor has agreed to
send army instructors to Manchuria.</i>

130
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,600
Why, look who's in my room.

131
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,830
Did you touch this?

132
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,790
I can just hear the General now.

133
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,130
"Why, Hatsumomo,
you used to smell of jasmine.

134
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,140
What's this new perfume?
Blowfish?"

135
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,980
I told you never to touch my things.
Can't you understand why?

136
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,150
Because your General will say,
"Hatsumomo, you stink."

137
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,160
At least you don't smell as bad
as your sister.

138
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,910
You know, she was here.
She came by looking for you.

139
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,830
What?

140
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,420
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

141
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,670
Please, tell me where she is.

142
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,850
Only if you swear yourself
to me first.

143
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,720
Yes?

144
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,810
Now, get out.

145
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,880
Hatsumomo.
You'll wake the entire house.

146
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,720
Your big sister is thirsty. So am I.
Go get us some beer.

147
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,470
I'm not in the mood for beer.

148
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,390
I know what you're in the mood for,
and his name is Koichi.

149
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,820
What did you say, Korin?

150
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,570
I'm sorry. I forgot.

151
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,370
You're just jealous
someone cares for me.

152
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,420
Guess who this belongs to.

153
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,420
A geisha as desired as she is...

154
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,260
...ought to keep a close eye
on her clothes.

155
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,390
- It's Mameha's?
- Yes.

156
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,930
- How did you get it?
- Bribed her maid.

157
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,150
- There.
- I can't.

158
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,900
Give it to her.

159
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,370
- Little Chiyo, come. Come.
- Chiyo.

160
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,130
Now, then, little Chiyo,
it's time to practice your calligraphy.

161
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,390
There.

162
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,690
Remember, you swore yourself
to me.

163
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,020
Yes.

164
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,300
Don't let anybody see you.

165
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,520
Go, go!

166
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,190
This will teach the great Mameha.

167
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,030
Come, come.

168
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,510
Thieving rat!

169
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,390
That kimono was worth more
than you!

170
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,020
Careful! You will hurt yourself
more than her!

171
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,900
Let me.

172
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,870
Kneel!

173
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,750
What have you done
to Hatsumomo?

174
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,210
I haven't done anything.
I promise you.

175
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,090
Her little trick with that kimono
will cost you.

176
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:18,260
Whatever you have done to anger her,
you'd be wise to stop now.

177
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,220
Lie facedown!

178
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,180
I will beat you hard...

179
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,270
...so Mother does not
beat you harder.

180
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,970
I told you not to let anybody see you.

181
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,850
I have kept my promise.

182
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,310
So tell me, where is she?

183
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:15,400
<i>She's in the next hanamachi
in the house called Tatsuyo.</i>

184
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,490
In the pleasure district.

185
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,660
Trust me, little Chiyo,
you will find her.

186
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,370
Tatsuyo?

187
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,730
Satsu! Satsu!

188
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,360
Satsu!

189
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,610
Satsu from Yoroido! Satsu! Satsu!

190
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,950
No! Satsu! No! Satsu! Satsu!

191
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
Sat...

192
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,740
Satsu! Satsu!

193
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,070
Chiyo-chan!

194
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,990
- What took you so long?
- But, Satsu, I tried!

195
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,580
<i>I went to your okiya weeks ago.
They laughed and turned me away.</i>

196
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,290
Please, I did not know!

197
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,840
I've missed you so much!

198
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,800
Let's leave. Tonight.

199
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,100
But we need money, Chiyo. I know
I can steal some first thing tomorrow.

200
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,350
- No, please! Tonight!
- No, tomorrow!

201
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,110
Meet me at the Sasame Bridge
as soon as it's dark.

202
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,690
Now I have to go. Quickly,
before someone catches us.

203
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,820
What if I cannot get away?

204
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,370
Be there, Chiyo.
It's our one chance.

205
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,410
Once I've left, I can't go back.

206
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,330
I've waited as long as I can.
Now go!

207
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,590
What is she doing here?
She's seen us.

208
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,760
Stupid girl.
Why have you come back?

209
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,600
Your perfect chance to escape!

210
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
Get in!

211
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,980
- Koichi, please.
- Look at us.

212
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,770
Sneaking around like criminals.

213
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,900
- Koichi, don't...
- It's degrading.

214
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,200
What's going on?

215
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,990
Koichi.

216
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,950
Who's there?

217
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,290
Go! Now! Go!

218
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,920
Show your face.

219
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,550
<i>Look, Okasan! I caught her stealing!</i>

220
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,060
She was running away
with her sister, the whore!

221
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,310
You little thief!

222
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,230
No! She is lying!

223
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,610
- After all we have done for her!
- I saw her with a man! Right there!

224
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,320
His name is Koichi!

225
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,070
Shut up!
We should kick her out!

226
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,290
Take her arms.

227
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,520
You are never to see him again.

228
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,820
What do you think?
A geisha is free to love?

229
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,950
Never.

230
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,320
Bolt the gate!

231
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,830
<i>No one is leaving this okiya.</i>

232
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,620
Dr. Moro is very expensive.

233
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,540
You seem to be racking up
quite a debt.

234
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,380
Kimono destroyed...

235
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,010
...geisha school...

236
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,850
...rice and pickles, train ticket,
Mr. Bekku.

237
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:30,100
All this on top of the money
I paid Mr. Tanaka.

238
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,850
And for what?

239
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,320
And now I hear that your sister
has run away.

240
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:44,610
She didn't wait for you.
And now she can never come back.

241
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,910
You must forget
you ever had a sister.

242
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,630
We are your only family now.

243
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,120
"Dear Satsu and little Chiyo:

244
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,960
As one who was once
an orphan child myself...

245
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,960
...this humble person
is sorry to inform you...

246
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,720
...that six weeks after you left
for your new life in Miyako...

247
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,310
...the suffering of your
honored mother came to its end.

248
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,480
And only a few weeks afterward...

249
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,810
...your honored father
departed this world as well.

250
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,030
This humble person feels confident
both your honored parents...

251
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,320
...have found their places
in paradise. But happily..."

252
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,820
<i>At the temple...</i>

253
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,500
<i>... there is a poem called "Loss"
carved into the stone.</i>

254
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,160
<i>It has three words.</i>

255
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,670
<i>But the poet
has scratched them out.</i>

256
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,750
<i>You cannot read "Loss."</i>

257
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,050
<i>Only feel it.</i>

258
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,470
<i>My father and mother
had left this life.</i>

259
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,560
<i>My sister, I never heard of again.</i>

260
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,440
<i>I had dishonored the okiya,
so Mother had other plans for me.</i>

261
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,780
<i>I would pay back my debt...</i>

262
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,570
<i>... year after year after year.</i>

263
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,820
<i>Not as a geisha.</i>

264
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,700
<i>As her slave.</i>

265
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,130
It is too pretty a day
to be so unhappy.

266
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,390
Did you fall down?

267
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,350
Why so shy?

268
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,400
Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all stumble from time to time.

269
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,280
You see that enchanting lady
in green?

270
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,120
<i>Once, when she was just a maiko,
she fell clean off her wooden shoes.</i>

271
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,240
It's true, I did.

272
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,250
And now look at her. So elegant.

273
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,790
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?
We will miss the beginning.

274
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,880
We see the Spring Dances every year.
We can spare a moment.

275
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,220
What's your name?

276
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,600
Don't be afraid to look at me.

277
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,060
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?

278
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,690
You mean, to eat?

279
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,450
I like sweet plum myself.

280
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,320
Come.

281
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,080
None of us find as much kindness
in this life as we should.

282
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,620
Hi. Both kinds, please.

283
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,670
My children wait for these
every spring.

284
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,900
Now I'm a geisha too.

285
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,360
And so you are.

286
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,320
How did you come by
such surprising eyes?

287
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,910
My mother gave them to me.

288
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,330
Generous of her, wasn't it?

289
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,210
As you have been to me.

290
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,170
Smile for me, won't you?

291
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,510
There, now. That is your gift to me.

292
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,850
This will buy your supper.

293
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,730
Now, promise me one thing:

294
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,150
Next time you take a tumble,
no frowns.

295
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,650
That's better.

296
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,290
<i>In that moment...</i>

297
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,330
<i>... I changed from a girl
facing nothing but emptiness...</i>

298
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,880
<i>... to someone with purpose.</i>

299
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>I saw that to be a geisha...</i>

300
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,550
<i>... could be a stepping stone
to something else:</i>

301
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,300
<i>A place in his world.</i>

302
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,960
<i>The money the Chairman
had given me...</i>

303
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,760
<i>... could have bought fish and rice
for a month.</i>

304
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,510
<i>But I gave it back in prayer...</i>

305
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,800
<i>... keeping only his handkerchief.</i>

306
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,270
<i>I asked one day
to become a geisha.</i>

307
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,240
<i>And then, somehow,
to meet him again.</i>

308
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,180
<i>The Imperial War Ministry
announces news:</i>

309
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,810
<i>A great victory for our friend
Adolf Hitler.</i>

310
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,320
<i>Today, Hitler demanded
self-determination...</i>

311
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,820
<i>... for Germans living in Austria.</i>

312
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,200
<i>Hitler's quest for lebensraum,
"living space"...</i>

313
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,910
Chiyo-chan, I can't find my comb!
Did you find it yet?

314
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,990
Pumpkin, it's time to go.

315
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,950
<i>- I found it.
- Arigato, Chiyo.</i>

316
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,710
Oh, I couldn't sleep last night,
I was so worried about my stupid hair.

317
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,840
Am I lopsided?

318
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
You look beautiful.

319
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,260
With your hair like that...

320
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,720
...you look more like a pumpkin
than ever.

321
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,850
Don't poke your neck forward
like a tortoise.

322
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,890
She's not ready? We will be late.

323
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,650
Poor Pumpkin. Her debut,
and everyone will be staring at you.

324
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,190
- Hurry up, huh?
- This time...

325
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,570
...tune your shamisen
before you play.

326
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,620
When you make a fool of yourself,
your big sister gets the blame.

327
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,620
Stop crying, your face will run.

328
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,710
Pumpkin!

329
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,860
Pumpkin!

330
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,680
<i>The winter I turned 15,
I saw the Chairman again.</i>

331
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,720
<i>But that wasn't the only surprise
fate brought me that season.</i>

332
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,350
<i>Along with the snow
came a most unexpected visitor.</i>

333
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,900
Why is she here?

334
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,780
Chiyo! Chiyo!

335
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,240
Open the gate!

336
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,440
<i>Now that your beloved
Granny is gone...</i>

337
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,400
<i>... you'll have no need for a maid.</i>

338
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,490
I would never question
the great Mameha...

339
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,950
<i>...but you could choose anyone
in the hanamachi.</i>

340
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,200
You flatter me, truly.

341
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,870
I'd give you my Pumpkin if she were
not already tied to Hatsumomo.

342
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,920
Please. I would never dream
of asking.

343
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,960
Besides, I could always sell Chiyo
to Mrs. Tatsuyo.

344
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,130
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent...

345
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,550
...surely you can see
what a terrible waste that would be.

346
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:19,140
If you were not the kind-hearted
geisha I know you to be...

347
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,940
...then I might think you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

348
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,700
Then I'm grateful, Mrs. Nitta, that
you don't have a suspicious mind.

349
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,530
Perhaps you can pique
my interest with...

350
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,280
Yes?

351
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,500
...your offer.

352
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,170
I will cover Chiyo's schooling,
all her expenses...

353
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,090
...till after her debut.

354
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,300
Now I am confident you are teasing.

355
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,010
I could not be more sincere.

356
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,350
If Chiyo hasn't repaid her debt
within six months after her debut...

357
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,350
Impossible! Too little time.

358
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,440
Then I will pay you twice over.

359
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,400
What?

360
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,360
No geisha could ever...

361
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,530
I am certain you will not object
to one trivial condition.

362
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,830
Yes?

363
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,870
If Chiyo erases her debt
in the time allowed...

364
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,120
...you will have no part
in her future earnings.

365
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,470
It's too good to be true.
Mameha is up to something.

366
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,390
She isn't in it for the money.
That much is for certain.

367
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,350
<i>Rumor has it, ever since the prime
minister bought her mizuage...</i>

368
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,020
...she's been rich.

369
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,100
That so? Absurd to think
she noticed Chiyo.

370
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,980
It's that kimono.

371
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,900
She remembers
how you destroyed it.

372
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,530
- Now she wants to get even.
- An odd picture, isn't it?

373
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:01,080
Hatsumomo sweeping into teahouse
after teahouse with our little Pumpkin.

374
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,080
And Mameha with our maid.

375
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,670
I'm so far behind.
I will never catch up to you.

376
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,750
Don't worry, Chiyo-chan.
I will help you.

377
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,760
Pumpkin!

378
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,260
You are never to speak to her again.

379
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,390
Now you are rivals.

380
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,070
Pumpkin.

381
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,570
Pumpkin.

382
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,630
<i>This is how it was,
this tiny world of women.</i>

383
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,800
<i>Friend turned against friend.</i>

384
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,720
<i>And now the two greatest geisha
in Miyako at war over me.</i>

385
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,760
<i>Hatsumomo at my back.</i>

386
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,180
<i>Mameha calling,
offering me the chance...</i>

387
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,940
<i>... to become one of those elegant
women I'd seen on the bridge...</i>

388
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:14,190
<i>... floating in a silk kimono,
the Chairman at my side.</i>

389
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,950
Chiyo is my new protégée.

390
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,030
As lovely as her big sister.

391
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,500
And with eyes the color of rain.

392
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,500
<i>The Baron is a very special man
to me. My danna.</i>

393
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,800
Someday, if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.

394
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,510
Don't kneel. You are not
a servant girl anymore.

395
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,730
Step into the light.

396
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,400
I see water in you.

397
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,530
Does that displease you?

398
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,370
Water is powerful.

399
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:08,000
It can wash away earth,
put out fire and even destroy iron.

400
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,830
But you have not drawn
on those strengths, have you?

401
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,750
About your kimono...

402
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,800
You may apologize if you wish.

403
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,720
Why, that is a perfect bow...

404
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,010
...for a pig farmer.

405
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,560
Don't drop your head.
Fingertips together.

406
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Elbows in. No weight on the hands.

407
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,400
Yes.

408
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,980
As for the kimono,
I'm no fool, Chiyo.

409
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,740
Hatsumomo cannot
tolerate competition.

410
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,320
She is jealous of you?

411
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,740
Not me, I'm afraid.

412
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,870
Someone closer to home.

413
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,040
Rise.

414
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,080
Not like a horse.

415
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,470
Slide your foot forward.

416
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,760
That's it. Now walk.

417
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,560
You are a magnificent geisha.

418
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,600
Tell me, Chiyo, does Mrs. Nitta
ever speak of the future?

419
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,400
Not to me.

420
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,110
Well, someday soon,
she will have to name an heir.

421
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,990
One of her own geisha
to succeed her.

422
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,490
Strange, isn't it,
she has not adopted Hatsumomo.

423
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,120
That would be like releasing
the tiger from its cage.

424
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,120
You have a gift for expression.

425
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,500
And if Mrs. Nitta adopts Pumpkin...

426
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,090
...that is hardly a threat.

427
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,420
But a young girl
with eyes like rain...

428
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,970
But Mrs. Nitta would never
choose me.

429
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,430
On the contrary, that is our goal.

430
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,640
- It is?
- Of course.

431
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,520
<i>If you do not inherit the okiya,
then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.</i>

432
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,690
Water's always in such a hurry.

433
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,650
Perhaps it is just as well.

434
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,450
We have no time to lose.

435
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,540
<i>We must transform you.</i>

436
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,380
<i>And what takes years,
you must learn in months.</i>

437
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,720
Say I'm entertaining the Baron.

438
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Like so many clients, he's trapped
in an arranged marriage.

439
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,350
So in the teahouse, when he's
seeking my company instead...

440
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,980
...I reward him like this:

441
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,610
With a glimpse of my wrist.

442
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,780
Seeing this demure little trace
of naked skin...

443
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,160
Well, it gives him pleasure.

444
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,530
Or when you're sitting down...

445
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,200
...for the briefest moment,
press your leg against his.

446
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,620
Always by accident, of course.

447
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,730
<i>Mameha, when does a geisha
choose her danna?</i>

448
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,150
<i>I'm afraid it's the other way around.</i>

449
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,360
<i>Focus on your studies, Chiyo.</i>

450
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,240
<i>Music, the art of conversation.</i>

451
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,070
<i>That's the surest way
to attract a danna.</i>

452
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,660
<i>On your feet, not off them.</i>

453
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,110
<i>Remember, Chiyo,
geisha are not courtesans.</i>

454
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,450
<i>And we are not wives.</i>

455
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,750
<i>We sell our skills,
not our bodies.</i>

456
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,830
<i>We create another secret world.</i>

457
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,210
<i>A place only of beauty.</i>

458
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,300
<i>The very word "geisha"
means "artist."</i>

459
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,970
<i>And to be a geisha is to be judged
as a moving work of art.</i>

460
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,370
<i>Agony and beauty, for us,
live side by side.</i>

461
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,710
<i>Your feet will suffer,
your fingers will bleed.</i>

462
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,760
<i>Even sitting and sleeping
will be painful.</i>

463
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,600
<i>You cannot call yourself
a true geisha...</i>

464
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,570
<i>... until you can stop a man
in his tracks with a single look.</i>

465
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,900
No one can do that.

466
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,240
Choose someone for me.

467
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,700
The grey hat.

468
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,770
<i>Choose someone for me, Onei-san.</i>

469
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,940
The boy on the bike, with one look.

470
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
You are ready.

471
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,960
Hurry up!

472
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,960
You are not making money
standing there gawking at yourself.

473
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,380
For luck!

474
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:25,370
This binds us together forever
as sisters.

475
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:29,460
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

476
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,420
From this day forward,
you will be known as:

477
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,920
"Sayuri."

478
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,600
<i>When Mameha granted me
my new name...</i>

479
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:49,940
<i>... I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.</i>

480
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,480
<i>I was a maiko now.</i>

481
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,230
<i>An apprentice geisha.</i>

482
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,530
<i>From that moment, I told myself:</i>

483
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,490
<i>"When I make tea,
when I pour sake...</i>

484
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,450
<i>... when I dance,
when I tie my obi...</i>

485
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,460
<i>... it will be for the Chairman.</i>

486
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,080
<i>Until he finds me.</i>

487
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,750
<i>Until I am his. "</i>

488
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,930
Ready?

489
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,110
Thank you.

490
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,610
Friends...

491
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:47,240
<i>...we have the pleasure to witness
the debut of a new maiko.</i>

492
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,470
I remember those eyes.

493
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,680
What was her name?

494
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,020
Sayuri.

495
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,450
Determined, isn't she?

496
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:35,500
If there'd been a drop of tea in that pot,
Sayuri would have gotten it out.

497
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,840
Don't tease, Baron,
it is her very first time.

498
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:42,730
What a beautiful dance,
yes, Pumpkin?

499
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,740
Her fans are so hypnotic...

500
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,240
...that you never notice her feet.

501
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,830
- What's her name?
- Her name is Sayuri.

502
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,040
Sayuri? A name as sweet
as she is.

503
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,590
I'm afraid these days...

504
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:05,670
...even a common chambermaid
can call herself a geisha.

505
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:11,340
<i>So it's nice to see such
a sincere young maiko. Isn't it?</i>

506
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,100
Why, yes.

507
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,270
Surely you would like
to thank Hatsumomo...

508
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:18,100
...for her gracious compliments.

509
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,770
There is so much I would like
to say to Hatsumomo.

510
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,690
Sometimes the smartest remark
is silence.

511
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,950
What better advice to follow
than your own?

512
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,570
Sayuri.

513
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,200
<i>- I was a maiko myself once.
- Of course.</i>

514
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,040
But it's been such a very long...

515
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,790
...long, long, long time.

516
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:57,060
I shall destroy you.

517
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,310
<i>She can destroy you.
She will spread rumors...</i>

518
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,980
<i>... stalk you from teahouse
to teahouse, then steal your clients.</i>

519
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,150
All in the hope that Mrs. Nitta
adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

520
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:12,530
- What can we do?
- We've got to outwit her.

521
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,990
To find a place somewhere
beyond her reach...

522
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,290
...where you can practice your skills
without any interference.

523
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,500
- Your first sumo match.
- What?

524
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,080
Today you will meet
Iwamura Ken.

525
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,550
He is head of the Iwamura Electric
Company in Osaka.

526
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,760
My client for years.

527
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,180
We will entertain him
and his partner, Nobu.

528
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,970
We may find Nobu
quite a challenge.

529
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,680
He does not like geisha.

530
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,530
Be attentive. I will do the rest.

531
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,910
Chairman Iwamura. President Nobu.

532
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,700
This is my new younger sister, Sayuri.

533
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,290
Nobu-san.

534
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,880
Nobu-san.

535
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,720
Injured in Manchuria. War hero.

536
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,640
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

537
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,560
Nobu-san will have to educate you.
I cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

538
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,730
That is the Chairman's diplomatic way
of saying he hates sumo.

539
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,990
Did you notice our contribution?

540
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:34,990
We are harnessing
the power of water...

541
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:38,030
...to bring electricity
to some of the smaller villages.

542
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,410
- It was in the newspapers, wasn't it?
- With the Chairman's picture.

543
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,920
You compensate for all
my shortcomings, don't you?

544
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:50,710
May I ask, how does someone
harness the power of water?

545
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:55,130
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing, because he will...

546
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,590
Let the girl watch sumo.

547
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:11,820
Hatsumomo, that snake.
Quick, turn your attention to Nobu.

548
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,530
But, Mameha-neisan...

549
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,780
Hatsumomo finds him repulsive.
She'd never steal him away.

550
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,910
Mislead her. Go.

551
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:42,810
Perhaps Nobu-san will be kind enough
to explain the rules of the match.

552
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,480
Three things matter in life:
Sumo, business and war.

553
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,820
Understand one,
you know them all.

554
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,980
But why should a geisha care?

555
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,530
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.

556
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,030
I humbly beg to differ.

557
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,120
What is sumo
but a dance between giants?

558
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,790
What is business
but a dance between companies?

559
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,750
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.

560
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,680
They are throwing salt
to purify the ring.

561
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,980
That man is Miyagiyama,
the greatest fighter in Japan.

562
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,230
But he's so tiny.

563
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,240
Only compared to his opponent.

564
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,530
<i>Miyagiyama may use hataki komi.</i>

565
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,290
Are you listening?

566
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,410
Yes.

567
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,710
<i>Hataki komi is a movement
the smaller combatant uses...</i>

568
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,050
...to throw the larger man
off balance.

569
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,470
Victory does not always belong
to the powerful.

570
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,510
Look. There.

571
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,350
In his eyes.

572
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,440
I'm afraid our time
has come to a close.

573
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,900
- Going so soon?
- Not yet. I want her to see.

574
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,800
<i>Now that is hataki komi!</i>

575
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,170
I see now why you like sumo.

576
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:44,850
You can never judge a man's power
by his appearance alone.

577
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,640
Mameha.

578
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,850
You may bring her again.

579
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:15,960
<i>I scoured the newspaper
for the Chairman's photograph.</i>

580
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,260
<i>Anything to preserve
our moment together.</i>

581
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,880
<i>A moment stolen...</i>

582
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,220
<i>... when I was forced
to turn my attention to Nobu.</i>

583
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,560
<i>In that instant, I felt the world shift.</i>

584
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:35,100
<i>But not my own determination.</i>

585
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,150
<i>I made a secret promise:</i>

586
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:42,740
<i>Along with his picture,
I would lock away my heart...</i>

587
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,660
<i>... and save it for him.</i>

588
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,080
Come in.

589
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:59,000
Tonight we will deliver a quick blow
to Hatsumomo.

590
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:02,130
- How?
- We will meet Nobu-san...

591
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,840
...at the Tsunashima restaurant.

592
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,140
But first, a visit to Dr. Crab.

593
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,180
- Dr. Crab?
- It's a little nickname...

594
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,350
...he's earned over the years.

595
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,980
Hold still.

596
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,980
I have something in mind. A plan.

597
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,520
Now cut your leg
where I've marked it.

598
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,360
- What?
- Or I will do it for you...

599
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,700
Have you gone mad?

600
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,660
Do you trust me or don't you?

601
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,870
Well?

602
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,380
Go ahead, do it.

603
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:53,680
Careless with the sewing scissors,
were you?

604
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,390
Right through your beautiful kimono.
Such a pity.

605
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,730
It won't leave a scar, will it?

606
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:05,740
Sayuri is a special girl
at a very special time in her life.

607
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:09,200
Yes.

608
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:15,080
With those eyes,
you must be quite a commodity.

609
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,920
Clean cut.

610
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,510
Won't leave a mark, I promise.

611
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,430
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.

612
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:51,620
<i>Your honorable sister says,
"Cut your leg," you cut your leg.</i>

613
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,450
<i>She says, "Follow me,"
you follow her.</i>

614
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,950
<i>My life had turned into a game...</i>

615
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:00,790
<i>... and only she knew the rules.</i>

616
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:08,300
<i>Ekubo. At the right moment,
slip it to Nobu discreetly.</i>

617
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,470
He will know what it means.

618
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,730
- You have kept us waiting.
- Please, forgive us, Nobu-san.

619
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,570
The Chairman thinks I should
take more pleasure in life.

620
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,400
Music and the theatre.

621
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,910
What is your impression?

622
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,410
It is useless
to push a cart sideways.

623
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:41,670
One could not wish Nobu-san
to be anyone but Nobu-san.

624
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,830
I could not agree more.

625
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,790
I owe this man everything.

626
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,670
He gives me too much credit,
as usual.

627
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,720
Probably.

628
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,520
It is a trinket.

629
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,440
I found it a few days ago.

630
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,860
Nobu-san. I had no idea
you were so sentimental.

631
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,950
Call it my new leaf.

632
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,240
My mother...

633
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:21,460
My mother, she used to wear
something similar.

634
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,170
You do not like it?

635
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,720
Forgive me. I've never received
a present before.

636
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:39,640
What a beautiful comb.

637
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,730
Such a joyous moment, Sayuri.

638
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:48,150
You are finally getting
what you deserve.

639
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,230
How lovely.

640
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,910
And now, will you excuse us,
please?

641
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,740
We have another engagement.

642
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,910
Many, in fact.

643
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,580
Pumpkin.

644
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,550
You are most kind.

645
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,990
Now, give this one to Dr. Crab.

646
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,780
- Mameha, please.
- You're upset?

647
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:40,200
I want to trust you, I do. But you
have to tell me what's going on.

648
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,200
I am ensuring your future.

649
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,040
But tell me how. I beg you.

650
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,080
I'm trying to orchestrate
a bidding war.

651
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,000
- What for?
- Your most precious attribute.

652
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,380
<i>- And what is that?
- Your mizuage.</i>

653
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,970
Did Mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

654
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,180
Well, every once in a while...

655
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:04,640
...a man's eel likes to visit
a woman's cave.

656
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,850
- Yes, I know.
- You do?

657
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,650
I live with Hatsumomo.

658
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:13,530
Your cave is untouched.
Men like that.

659
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,320
<i>We call this mizuage.</i>

660
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,110
And to become a full geisha,
you must sell it to the highest bidder.

661
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,820
Did you sell yours?

662
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:24,490
The largest sum ever paid.
Ten thousand yen.

663
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,830
I freed myself from debt.

664
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,170
And so will you.

665
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:32,040
When you slip the rice cake
to Dr. Crab...

666
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,760
<i>...it is a sign that says
your mizuage is ripe for sale.</i>

667
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,720
The doctor has no desire
to see you tonight.

668
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,010
Or any night.

669
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:53,360
Pumpkin. Hatsumomo
went to see Dr. Crab, yes?

670
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,190
I have to go, Chiyo-chan.

671
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,780
- Didn't she?
- I do not know.

672
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,530
Of course you know.
You shadow her every step.

673
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,490
You expect me to betray
my big sister?

674
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,370
Has she made you cruel as well?

675
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,710
- No.
- My Pumpkin always told the truth.

676
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,040
But...

677
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,880
The truth.

678
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,640
Tonight we went to the teahouse
to see Dr. Crab.

679
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,560
I sat outside, but I could still hear
through the screen.

680
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,390
And Hatsumomo then said to him:

681
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,390
<i>"I live in the same okiya as Sayuri.</i>

682
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:32,440
Did you know that she brings men
back to her room?"

683
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,060
"No," he said.

684
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,440
"Common sailors
and fishermen too."

685
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,610
The doctor looked queasy,
like he didn't want to hear any more.

686
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,200
But she kept going.

687
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,570
And Hatsumomo said to him,
"What's the matter?

688
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,240
Have I told you more
than you wanted to know?"

689
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,040
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to say something...

690
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:56,420
...but how could I,
Chiyo-chan? How?

691
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,590
Am I really like her? Am I?

692
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,260
Of course not.

693
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,850
Is Mameha-san cruel to you too?

694
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:10,350
No. She's so kind to me.

695
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:15,270
But sometimes I worry she's taking me
further from the things I want.

696
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,610
That man Nobu.

697
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,530
Do you really like him?

698
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:27,370
- No.
- That's what I thought.

699
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,410
Do you like somebody else?

700
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,800
Don't worry about me,
Chiyo-chan, I'll be fine.

701
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,470
Better than fine.

702
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,470
Mother plans to adopt me...

703
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:52,810
...so my dream of having someplace
to live out my life may come true.

704
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,770
I have to go.

705
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,700
We could still win, Sayuri.

706
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:08,830
How? Hatsumomo has poisoned
Dr. Crab against me.

707
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:12,660
Forget about him. There are plenty
of other fish in the sea.

708
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,120
- The Chairman has been kind...
- Sayuri.

709
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,500
Nobu and the Chairman
are business partners.

710
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,170
They would never bid
against one another.

711
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:23,130
It is time we cast a wider net.

712
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,760
<i>Suppose there was a night in Miyako,
hundreds of men, all in one place...</i>

713
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,350
<i>... eager to bid for you.
- What do you mean?</i>

714
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,680
<i>Where you are the object
of all their fantasies.</i>

715
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,520
<i>The most famous geisha
in the hanamachi.</i>

716
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,110
<i>- But I'm not.
- You will be.</i>

717
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,790
Who is responsible for this?

718
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,790
Ask Mameha.

719
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,170
<i>I'm asking you, Okasan.</i>

720
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,170
How come Sayuri
gets to be the lead?

721
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:03,380
It's your own fault.
You should practice more.

722
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,890
What did Mameha do?

723
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,390
Speak to the director in private?

724
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,230
Not every geisha
uses that kind of currency.

725
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,860
I'm looking forward
to your performance.

726
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:32,080
You know how I adore
watching you dance, Chiyo.

727
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,230
They've all come.

728
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,610
The Baron, Nobu-san...

729
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:13,620
...our beloved Hatsumomo
and that dapper General of hers.

730
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,290
Anybody else?

731
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:19,040
And even your old friend, Dr. Crab.

732
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,970
What if I dance poorly?

733
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:38,100
What if I disgrace myself
and no one takes interest?

734
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,650
You will be glorious.

735
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,500
Now it's time.

736
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,690
Sayuri, you remember the doctor.

737
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:15,690
I hope my performance
pleased you, doctor.

738
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,360
Oh, you dance
with such profound feeling.

739
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,360
I most humbly thank you.

740
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,530
It seems you've once again
caught the doctor's interest.

741
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,540
And I am most grateful.

742
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,790
- If you have heard any gossip...
- Yes?

743
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:33,210
...then I hope you will follow
your own advice.

744
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:36,710
And what would that be, pray tell?

745
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,380
Seek a second opinion.

746
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,600
Chairman.

747
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,900
Sayuri gave such a passionate
performance, don't you think?

748
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,610
Indeed.

749
01:23:56,610 --> 01:24:00,070
Mameha, did you invite the Chairman
to my estate this weekend?

750
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,740
It's my annual blossom-viewing party.

751
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,870
Baron, I told you I can't go.
I have an urgent appointment.

752
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,410
Taking care of a little nuisance?

753
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:12,920
Or was that a naughty secret?

754
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,920
Baron, wouldn't Sayuri
look stunning...

755
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,260
...among the flowers
on your estate?

756
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,930
Yes, very pretty.
Be sure to send her along.

757
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:25,350
With a chaperone, of course.

758
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:28,890
I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.

759
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:33,270
That's a fine idea, Baron.
But Sayuri is required at the theatre.

760
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,610
Mameha, I expect her there.

761
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:39,440
Nobu. Coming Saturday?

762
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,450
All that way to see a cherry tree?
I will leave that to the Chairman.

763
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,620
Wonderful tonight.
Excuse me.

764
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,960
If you would rather not go...

765
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,300
I'd like to go very much.

766
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,800
Then be on your guard,
every moment.

767
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,140
<i>There is a reason Hatsumomo
wants you there.</i>

768
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,720
<i>Trust me, I know my Baron, Sayuri.</i>

769
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,810
<i>He has a weakness
for beautiful women.</i>

770
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:16,980
<i>And now you are the most
celebrated geisha in all Miyako.</i>

771
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:20,150
<i>The most desired as well.</i>

772
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:00,770
Pardon. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Sayuri.

773
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:05,110
Today, even the cherry blossoms
are envious of her.

774
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,540
There's something I've been wanting
to say to you for some time now.

775
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,380
I'd like to...

776
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,720
To thank you for your attention
to Nobu-san.

777
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,050
Nobu can be a difficult man.
So severe.

778
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,470
<i>Hates parties, sake
only in moderation.</i>

779
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,390
And he disdains geisha.

780
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,390
But he...

781
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,900
He's fond of you.

782
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:45,360
Because you admire him,
I respect him more.

783
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,910
He will never tell you himself.
He's far too modest.

784
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:52,780
We were fighting
in Manchuria together.

785
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,000
There was an explosion.

786
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,080
He protected me
from the worst of it.

787
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:03,130
As you might imagine,
I owe him quite a debt.

788
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,420
Nobu has taught me a great deal.

789
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,590
Patience, for one thing.

790
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:10,550
I, in turn, have tried to teach him...

791
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,430
...you have to savor life
while you can.

792
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,270
The lesson of the cherry blossom.

793
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,770
That is why Nobu likes you.

794
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,440
We must not expect
happiness, Sayuri.

795
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,150
It is not something we deserve.

796
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:27,360
When life goes well,
it's a sudden gift.

797
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,950
It cannot last forever.

798
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,160
Sayuri.

799
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,590
There you are.
I have a present for you.

800
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,930
Mameha asked me to show you
my kimono collection.

801
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,890
It's quite venerated.

802
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:00,310
My grandfather and father
collected kimono before me.

803
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,650
I've given a number
of valuable kimono to Mameha.

804
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:08,150
I like to give present
to beautiful girls.

805
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,910
It's for you.

806
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:20,160
Come. Have a closer look.

807
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,000
Isn't it lovely?

808
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,010
Try it on.

809
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,850
The Baron is too kind.

810
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:42,020
I will happily try it on with Mameha
when the Baron returns to Miyako.

811
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,900
Who knows when that will be?

812
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,940
Put it on now. Don't be shy.

813
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,320
Don't worry.

814
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,950
I am experienced in knotting obis.
And untying them as well.

815
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,870
Please. Mr. Bekku is waiting.

816
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:05,960
Bekku is waiting for no one.

817
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,880
Please!

818
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,550
Stop!

819
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,140
Please!

820
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,400
Stop now!

821
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,880
Sayuri...

822
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,050
...I only want to have a look.

823
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,430
No harm in that.

824
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,720
Any man would do the same.

825
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,170
<i>I heard a message on the wind.</i>

826
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:16,010
So careless.

827
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:19,340
- You have ruined all our plans.
- I did nothing.

828
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:23,510
Please, Sayuri, do not insult me.
I know the Baron better than that.

829
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,930
He gave me a kimono.

830
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:28,350
- You sold yourself for a kimono.
- I did not sell myself!

831
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:31,060
<i>Today is the day I accept bids
for your mizuage.</i>

832
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,230
What kind of price
can I hope to demand...

833
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,230
...with a finger pointed at your back?

834
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,990
<i>He looked at me,
that's all, Onei-san.</i>

835
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,410
<i>You will be examined
at the mizuage ceremony.</i>

836
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,280
If you are found to be worthless...

837
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,160
I am not worthless!

838
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,870
I am not worthless.

839
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:06,680
How much longer is this bidding
going to take?

840
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:12,560
Besides, who wants a plum when
someone has already had a bite?

841
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,080
What is it?

842
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,580
Twenty yen? Thirty?

843
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:37,340
This can't be the right amount.

844
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:41,590
I trust you agree.
I have won the wager.

845
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,590
Sayuri's made history.

846
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:49,600
<i>No mizuage has ever been sold
for more. Not even mine.</i>

847
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,270
Fifteen thousand yen.

848
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:54,600
Unbelievable.

849
01:32:56,770 --> 01:33:00,610
Of course, none of it will go
to Sayuri.

850
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:05,450
<i>Or to you, Mameha.
It goes to this okiya.</i>

851
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:09,290
All 15,000 yen to this estate.

852
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,580
I do not understand.

853
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:17,130
That Sayuri will inherit
as my adopted daughter.

854
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:20,170
- What?
- You wouldn't dare.

855
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,130
I'm entitled to do as I choose.

856
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,800
<i>But you promised
the okiya to Pumpkin!</i>

857
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:32,810
<i>Look at her. Still a virgin maiko.</i>

858
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,980
- Pumpkin!
- Can't you adopt us both?

859
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:39,650
Quiet, Sayuri. I'm no fool.

860
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:43,150
Pumpkin would only be
Hatsumomo's puppet.

861
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:48,450
How long will it take before
you kick us out onto the street?

862
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:50,580
I have given you my life.

863
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,330
Yes.

864
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,290
Your impudence.

865
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:56,830
Your foul temper.

866
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,380
Who paid for the silk on your back?
The rice in your bowl?

867
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,220
The tobacco in that pipe of yours?
Who?

868
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,020
<i>Don't exaggerate!
You have never even had a danna.</i>

869
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:16,690
- Don't say it. Don't say...
- You chose that no-good Koichi.

870
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:19,020
- Stop it.
- Sneaking through your window...

871
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,610
...at all hours of the night.
- Quiet!

872
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,280
Not like a geisha.

873
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,490
Like a common prostitute.

874
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,620
Enough!

875
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:33,950
Besides, you are getting old.

876
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,460
But Sayuri?

877
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:42,340
Sayuri is destined
to become a legend.

878
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,810
<i>My dear Okasan.</i>

879
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,570
We will see...

880
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,570
...won't we?

881
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:17,160
Sayuri, your room is too small.

882
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,500
Take Hatsumomo's.

883
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,470
From now on,
your name is Nitta Sayuri.

884
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,930
May I congratulate you both.

885
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,180
You too.

886
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,610
Everything we wanted,
you made happen. Thank you.

887
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:49,950
May I ask who?

888
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,280
Dr. Crab.

889
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,120
Was Nobu disappointed?

890
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:59,830
Nobu did not bid.
It was against his mighty principles.

891
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:04,590
Dr. Crab was opposed by the Baron.

892
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,760
My Baron.

893
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,970
Do you want to know
the truth, Sayuri?

894
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,510
He was the highest bidder.

895
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:16,520
Forgive me.
But I let it go to Dr. Crab.

896
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,480
I think you understand why.

897
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,810
I swear to you, I am innocent.

898
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,440
Of course you are.

899
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:28,110
No man would ever bid so much
for a thing he had already taken.

900
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:33,200
It was my own fault.
I did not protect you.

901
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,620
Celebrate this moment, Sayuri.

902
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:48,130
<i>Tonight, the lights in the hanamachi
all burn for you.</i>

903
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,860
My daughter.

904
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:41,280
You are full geisha now.

905
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,310
What are you doing in my room?

906
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:15,030
I came to congratulate you.

907
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:19,110
Please get out.

908
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:23,370
Why, little Chiyo.

909
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,330
Look what I found.

910
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:30,040
His initials, how elegant.

911
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,340
You've been hiding your love
for a long time.

912
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,420
The sacrifice every geisha
must make.

913
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,180
Don't!

914
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:05,200
Isn't this where you keep it?
Next to your heart?

915
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,550
Give it back!

916
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,560
Give it back!

917
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,980
No!

918
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:38,990
Mother!

919
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,910
Pumpkin! Mother!

920
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:52,080
Kimono!

921
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,250
Kimono, Sayuri!

922
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,720
Kimono! Pumpkin!

923
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,820
<i>I could be her.</i>

924
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:11,370
<i>Now I am geisha to this house.</i>

925
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:17,130
<i>I could be her.</i>

926
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,710
<i>Were we so different?</i>

927
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:21,710
<i>She loved once.</i>

928
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:24,220
<i>She hoped once.</i>

929
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:29,180
<i>I might be looking
into my own future.</i>

930
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:33,770
<i>Until the real future
came falling from the air.</i>

931
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,260
Stop.

932
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,980
Oh, Korin. Have you seen Sayuri?

933
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:06,440
No. I don't know.

934
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,500
Chairman!

935
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,540
They are sending us away,
but they won't say where.

936
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:25,800
Osaka. But you must not go.
The city is a prime target.

937
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,590
Get your things, quickly.

938
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:32,340
Nobu and I are trying
to find safe havens...

939
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,810
...for as many of you
as we can. Come.

940
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Here.

941
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,480
Work certificate. Nurse's aide.

942
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,030
Friend of mine is chief surgeon
in Kameoka.

943
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:49,690
What about Sayuri?
Can't we go together?

944
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:53,200
Don't worry.
She will be taken care of.

945
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,330
Here you are. Here we go!

946
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,750
Sayuri.

947
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,830
Sayuri! Come.

948
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:09,420
This is Arima.
He will take you into the hills.

949
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:13,090
Nobu has got a friend there.
A kimono-maker.

950
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,600
Anyone stops you, show them this.

951
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:21,770
- Do I have to go?
- It's remote. You will be safe.

952
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:27,980
What about you?
You said Osaka was dangerous.

953
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:33,320
Our factory is there.
I have no choice.

954
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,870
Go!

955
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:43,830
I will express your gratitude
to Nobu-san.

956
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,860
<i>A year without news...</i>

957
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:13,240
<i>... except news
of death, defeat, shame.</i>

958
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:19,410
<i>Rumors of cities evaporating
into clouds of smoke.</i>

959
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:21,870
<i>Then another year...</i>

960
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:24,040
<i>... and then another...</i>

961
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:28,460
<i>... until the old life is a dream life.</i>

962
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,510
<i>Was I ever geisha?</i>

963
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:34,590
<i>Did I ever dance...</i>

964
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,840
<i>... holding a fan?</i>

965
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,930
<i>Who would hold a fan now...</i>

966
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:43,310
<i>... or paint their lips?</i>

967
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,100
<i>And then another year.</i>

968
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,440
<i>Nothing.</i>

969
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,110
<i>Rice.</i>

970
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:52,610
<i>Work.</i>

971
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:54,690
<i>Rice.</i>

972
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,740
<i>Work.</i>

973
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:59,120
<i>Nothing.</i>

974
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,330
Sayuri!

975
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:13,800
Sayuri! A man from Osaka
has come to see you.

976
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,950
Nobu-san.

977
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:51,170
General Tottori was captured
and tried as a war criminal.

978
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:56,800
The Baron lost his fortune
and committed suicide.

979
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,590
<i>What about the okiya?</i>

980
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:00,890
Mr. Bekku is gone, but the others...

981
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:03,510
Auntie and Mother?

982
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:07,020
Indestructible, as always.

983
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,560
And the Chairman?

984
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:14,940
As well as can be expected.

985
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:21,780
This is all that remains
of our factories.

986
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,700
I'm so sorry, Nobu-san.

987
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,880
Sayuri...

988
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:41,050
We want to rebuild, but to do that
we will need your help.

989
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:42,970
What can I do?

990
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:46,600
Somewhere, under those rags...

991
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:50,390
...are you still the greatest geisha
in Miyako?

992
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:59,740
If a tree has no leaves or branches,
can you still call it a tree?

993
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:06,280
With nothing but rubble at my feet,
can I still call myself a businessman?

994
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:18,590
I should have taken
better care of you.

995
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:22,340
Please, you saved my life.

996
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,680
I owe you so much in return.

997
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:31,440
The Chairman and I
need American financing.

998
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,860
There is a man,
a certain Colonel Derricks...

999
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:38,360
...who has the power
to grant us a contract.

1000
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:41,450
I showed him your picture.

1001
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:44,870
He asked to meet you.

1002
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:52,790
I am not a persuasive man, Sayuri.

1003
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:55,830
But if you and a few geisha...

1004
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:59,960
...would once again put on
your kimono and join us...

1005
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:04,470
...we could show the Americans
how hospitable our country can be.

1006
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:07,640
How I wish, Nobu-san.

1007
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:10,970
But that was a long time ago.

1008
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:13,810
I have no doubt, Sayuri...

1009
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,230
...that you could still melt the heart
of any man.

1010
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:21,150
No matter how resistant.

1011
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:27,160
I am not accustomed to begging...

1012
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:32,330
...but please know
that if you consent...

1013
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:37,330
...the Chairman and I would be
most grateful.

1014
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:43,670
One dollar. One dollar.

1015
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,640
- What?
- One dollar.

1016
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,790
<i>The Chairman needed me.</i>

1017
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:19,710
<i>But I was a far cry from the geisha
I had once been.</i>

1018
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,460
Hey, mama-san, let's step inside.

1019
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:27,130
<i>The secrets of our hidden world were
postcards now for girls back home.</i>

1020
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:30,930
<i>Any streetwalker with a painted face
and silk kimono...</i>

1021
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:34,220
<i>... could call herself a geisha.</i>

1022
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,110
<i>I looked for the one person
who might help:</i>

1023
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,270
<i>Mameha.</i>

1024
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:45,490
<i>The war was written on her face.</i>

1025
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:50,990
<i>Everything about her, not just
her home, was less than before.</i>

1026
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:55,580
Sayuri, when my poor Baron
filled his pockets with stones...

1027
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:57,660
...I was desperate.

1028
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,460
What could I do?

1029
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,750
I sold my kimono,
I traded my jade combs for rations.

1030
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:08,760
It was painful at first,
but I have made my peace.

1031
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:13,430
Now, I make a small but tidy living
renting rooms.

1032
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,520
I am not about to go
chasing the past.

1033
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,640
It might do you good.

1034
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,690
- How?
- To remind you that, once...

1035
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:28,570
...with a single glance, you could bring
a man like the Baron to his knees.

1036
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,120
Well...

1037
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,620
...I did keep one kimono.

1038
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,810
<i>The Baron gave it to me
when he became my danna.</i>

1039
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,690
<i>Thank you, Onei-san.</i>

1040
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:14,070
So tell me. What do we know
about entertaining Americans?

1041
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,340
- Was she worth it?
- Hell, yeah.

1042
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:35,140
- Come on.
- All right.

1043
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,780
Chiyo-chan! Is that you?

1044
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:10,170
I have no right to ask favors of you,
Pumpkin, I know that.

1045
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:12,840
Guess what. I only smoke
Chesterfields now.

1046
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:17,050
<i>I have wanted to apologize to you
for so long about the okiya.</i>

1047
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:19,720
These soldiers, you know
who they've got me singing?

1048
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:22,980
- It should have gone to you.
- Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore.

1049
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:25,650
If it is in your heart to forgive me...

1050
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:29,070
Sayuri, don't.

1051
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:33,400
The honest truth?

1052
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:38,660
I'd rather chew sand
than go back to all that.

1053
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,580
Then you are not angry with me?

1054
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:48,000
Don't worry about me, chickadee.

1055
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,550
I've got more clients
than I can handle.

1056
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,680
You seem so at home
with these Americans.

1057
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,930
They're bastards.

1058
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,140
So who's this colonel?
Sounds like top brass.

1059
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:08,520
He has the power to approve
American funding...

1060
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,110
...for Nobu and the Chairman.

1061
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:15,740
So is he willing to pay us
American dollars?

1062
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:18,240
Cash?

1063
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:21,700
Don't waste my time.

1064
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:23,660
You think I'm a sucker?

1065
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:26,540
I want 60 cases Lucky Strike...

1066
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:30,790
...or I'm taking my business
to Sergeant MacPhee.

1067
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:36,260
<i>I had to become a geisha
once more.</i>

1068
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:41,810
<i>Mother had reopened the okiya,
but my powder box was empty.</i>

1069
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,350
<i>My charcoal had turned to dust.</i>

1070
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:51,310
<i>And yet, it was my one chance
to see the Chairman again.</i>

1071
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,900
<i>Would he notice
my weathered hands?</i>

1072
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,740
<i>The threadbare silk?</i>

1073
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:59,870
See? You are yourself again.

1074
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:05,290
<i>The world had changed completely.
Had he?</i>

1075
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:11,330
<i>And would I finally find the strength
to tell him all that I felt?</i>

1076
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:39,780
Just look at you, Sayuri.
It's as if the war did not happen.

1077
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,700
I am so glad to see that
the Chairman is safe.

1078
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,790
Accept my apologies
asking this of you...

1079
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,370
No.

1080
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:50,830
There is nothing I can do
to return your kindness.

1081
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:54,880
- I've wanted to tell you that...
- Sayuri!

1082
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,840
May I present Colonel Derricks.

1083
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:07,220
My God, you're more stunning
in person.

1084
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,560
This is my associate,
Lieutenant Hutchins.

1085
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,890
It's an honor, ma'am.

1086
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:14,770
Sayuri is one of the mysteries
of the Orient I told you about.

1087
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:17,820
A mystery that perhaps
you can solve.

1088
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,200
- Would you mind? Can we? Colonel.
- Yes, of course. Colonel.

1089
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,490
Okay, sure.

1090
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,450
Good.

1091
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:29,080
All right, hold it. Beautiful.

1092
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,790
Hey, who likes whiskey?

1093
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,750
Look at this. We got a live one, sir.

1094
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:37,500
Chairman, please don't tell me
you started the party without me.

1095
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:40,260
May I present Pumpkin.

1096
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:44,590
- Hello!
- Pumpkin! Over here.

1097
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,100
One sec.

1098
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,680
Okay! Gentlemen! Please.

1099
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,270
- Oh, it's been a long time.
- Good to see you.

1100
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:55,860
You haven't changed.
You look like a little boy.

1101
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:00,320
This is a... My!

1102
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:07,080
It's huge! Like an elephant.

1103
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:13,420
Please, have a seat. Buckle up.

1104
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:16,170
I'm excited, but I'm scared.

1105
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:19,130
You're not going anywhere! Okay?

1106
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,080
Good for him, not so good for us.

1107
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,160
May we join you, gentlemen?

1108
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,500
- Yes, please.
- Wow, I could get used to this.

1109
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:57,000
Back home, a bath is nothing more
than a quick shower on cold tile...

1110
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,750
...with a bar of lye soap, right?

1111
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:01,510
But here, you make everything
a ritual, don't you?

1112
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:05,590
That is the art of turning habit
into pleasure, colonel.

1113
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,590
Spoken like a true geisha.

1114
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:12,180
If we are in business together, then
perhaps we will visit you someday.

1115
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,480
I'd like to see the United States.

1116
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,600
I know a little game we can play.

1117
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,610
It's called Truth and Lies.

1118
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:24,610
I know this game.
Back home we call it "marriage."

1119
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:30,410
No, I'm serious. Now, listen closely.

1120
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:34,620
- Sayuri know the rules.
- I never met a woman who didn't.

1121
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:39,130
Each person says two things.
One is true, the other is not.

1122
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:43,880
If you guess right,
the liar pays the price.

1123
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,130
So it pays to lose.

1124
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:48,970
There you go.

1125
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:52,310
Okay, I'll go first. Let's see.

1126
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:56,520
One day in Sapporo,
where I was born...

1127
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:58,980
...a fisherman caught
a talking fish.

1128
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:01,060
The other story is the true one.

1129
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:03,780
And I haven't even heard it yet.

1130
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:07,320
- How would you know?
- No, no. You drink. You drink.

1131
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:12,240
- If I drown, it's all your fault.
- Nobu-san, your turn. Please.

1132
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,580
I'm no match for these geisha.
They are experts in the art of deceit.

1133
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:20,580
I'm an expert in one thing
and one thing only:

1134
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,630
<i>Sake.</i>

1135
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:26,170
Sayuri, the truest story you know.

1136
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,430
Once, when I was a little girl...

1137
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:34,770
...on the banks of the Sunagawa...

1138
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:37,600
...a handsome stranger
was kind enough...

1139
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:39,850
...to buy me a cup of sweet ice...

1140
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:42,020
I think we have to stop the game.

1141
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:45,530
<i>If Pumpkin drinks any more sake,
she will pass out.</i>

1142
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:49,320
- That is a true story.
- Mameha. Sayuri. Everyone.

1143
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:53,870
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1144
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,700
So...

1145
02:00:57,790 --> 02:01:00,790
...what is the protocol?

1146
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:02,380
Excuse me?

1147
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,550
Suppose I wanted to see you
in private.

1148
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:10,260
I beg your pardon, colonel,
that is not a geisha's custom.

1149
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:14,970
Don't be coy. I mean,
if it's a question of price, I'm sure...

1150
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:19,480
If there were a price,
you could never afford it.

1151
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,400
I saw the two of you whispering.

1152
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,230
You have arranged some kind
of tryst, haven't you?

1153
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:30,610
- What did you promise him?
- Your company. Nothing more.

1154
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:32,660
He seemed to expect a great deal!

1155
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,990
If I had wanted a common whore,
I could have hired one.

1156
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,700
What are you trying to say?

1157
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:42,330
Just the idea of you with him,
with any man...

1158
02:01:42,330 --> 02:01:44,580
...you'd be dead to me!

1159
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,180
Can't you see that I want you
for myself?

1160
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,600
You have ruined me.

1161
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:05,900
Before we met,
I was a disciplined man.

1162
02:02:07,770 --> 02:02:10,610
I should not have asked you
to come.

1163
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:13,030
The Chairman was against it.

1164
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:16,030
I should have listened to him.

1165
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:29,630
I must beg your forgiveness,
Nobu-san.

1166
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:33,380
I was foolish to think
you would barter me away.

1167
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:36,220
Then you made no arrangement
with the colonel?

1168
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:38,560
Please don't insult me again.

1169
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:43,770
If he ratifies our contract...

1170
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:46,610
...then I will be
a man of means again.

1171
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:50,570
There is nothing
I want more, Sayuri...

1172
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:54,360
<i>...than to become your danna.</i>

1173
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,660
I already owe you far too much.

1174
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:02,000
- I will not be refused.
- Please.

1175
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,670
We are tied to each other.
I know you feel it too.

1176
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:09,000
I never meant to mislead you.

1177
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,300
Sayuri...

1178
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:19,680
I do not like things
held up before me...

1179
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,470
...that I cannot have.

1180
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:26,690
When you first introduced me
to Nobu...

1181
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:29,020
...I was such a fool to give him
my attention.

1182
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:31,860
- You cannot refuse him. You must not.
- But, Mameha...

1183
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:35,240
What is he to think?
He safeguarded your life.

1184
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,450
- So he owns it?
- Sayuri.

1185
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:40,780
<i>I know what it is like to try
and scrape by without a danna.</i>

1186
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:43,080
I will do something, anything else.

1187
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:46,120
Renting rooms?
Scrounging for every meal?

1188
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,130
Is this the life that you want?

1189
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,710
I want a life that is mine!

1190
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:54,210
Nobu has never treated you
with anything but kindness.

1191
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:57,510
- I don't want mere kindness.
- What?

1192
02:03:57,510 --> 02:04:00,970
What more can we expect,
we geisha?

1193
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,270
You had feelings for the Baron,
didn't you?

1194
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:09,900
I never allowed myself that.

1195
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,820
Don't lie to me.

1196
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:14,150
In time, you learn.

1197
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:17,490
- I don't want to learn!
- Sayuri!

1198
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:21,490
We don't become geisha
to pursue our own destinies.

1199
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:25,830
We become geisha
because we have no choice.

1200
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:45,600
Pumpkin.

1201
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,390
What is it? What's wrong?

1202
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:50,520
Nothing. I have a favor to ask,
that's all.

1203
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,310
Ask.

1204
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:57,070
At 9:00, bring Nobu to the pool
on the far side of the garden.

1205
02:04:57,070 --> 02:05:00,530
Not a minute before,
not a minute after. Yes?

1206
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:05,950
And, please, do not tell Nobu
that I will be there waiting.

1207
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:08,210
It's a surprise?

1208
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:11,540
Yes, it's a surprise.

1209
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:51,920
Whoa, in here?

1210
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:57,710
What? No, no, no. Hang on.
Hey, hey, hey. No, whoa.

1211
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,940
I think we have done it.

1212
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:15,150
Let's make sure he signs.

1213
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:25,160
Wait!

1214
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:27,780
Are we doing this or not?

1215
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:29,790
Yes?

1216
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:03,650
Chairman.

1217
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:05,700
Chairman!

1218
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:15,420
How could you?

1219
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:18,340
You don't know
what you have done!

1220
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:20,670
But I do.

1221
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:24,670
I do not understand.

1222
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:27,340
Why did you have to bring
the Chairman?

1223
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,930
Because I know how you feel
about him.

1224
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:37,190
A long time ago,
you took something from me.

1225
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:41,190
The only thing I'd ever truly wanted.

1226
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:44,440
Well...

1227
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:48,740
...now you know how it feels.

1228
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:26,210
<i>The heart dies a slow death.</i>

1229
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:29,970
<i>Shedding each hope like leaves.</i>

1230
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:33,970
<i>Until one day there are none.</i>

1231
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:36,260
<i>No hopes.</i>

1232
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:39,600
<i>Nothing remains.</i>

1233
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:45,650
<i>She paints her face
to hide her face.</i>

1234
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,990
<i>Her eyes are deep water.</i>

1235
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:53,490
<i>It is not for geisha to want.</i>

1236
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:57,160
<i>It is not for geisha to feel.</i>

1237
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,500
<i>Geisha is an artist
of the floating world.</i>

1238
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:06,420
<i>She dances.</i>

1239
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,460
<i>She sings.</i>

1240
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:11,510
<i>She entertains you.</i>

1241
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:13,930
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

1242
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:17,100
<i>The rest is shadows.</i>

1243
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:21,020
<i>The rest is secret.</i>

1244
02:10:29,610 --> 02:10:33,990
Sayuri, quickly.
The teahouse just called.

1245
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:38,540
You are to meet
a very important client tonight.

1246
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:40,160
Who?

1247
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:44,040
It must be Nobu. Yes.

1248
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:51,050
He is going to be
one of the richest men in Osaka.

1249
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:55,550
He wants to honor his promise:

1250
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,260
<i>To become your danna at last.</i>

1251
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:03,270
Give me.

1252
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:06,900
It's about time.

1253
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:11,940
Finally, a return on my investment.

1254
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:17,910
Keiko, maybe one day
you will be as lucky.

1255
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,370
No geisha can ever hope for more.

1256
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:26,170
Let me see it.

1257
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,700
Chairman.

1258
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:41,780
Where is Nobu-san?

1259
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,790
He won't be coming.

1260
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:45,250
Is something wrong?

1261
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:50,330
He knows what happened.
It is not in his nature to forgive.

1262
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:55,590
Chairman, what happened
on the island...

1263
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:58,590
Please, you do not have to explain.

1264
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:04,510
But I have shamed myself so deeply,
past all forgiveness.

1265
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:09,190
No. I'm the one
who must be forgiven.

1266
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:13,820
I do not understand.

1267
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:18,150
Perhaps...

1268
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,530
...if you had only known the truth...

1269
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:24,870
The truth?

1270
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:30,080
Some years ago...

1271
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:33,130
...I was on my way to the theatre.

1272
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,670
I saw a little girl weeping
by the Sunagawa.

1273
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:41,380
I stopped to buy her
a cup of sweet ice.

1274
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:44,720
You knew I was that little girl?

1275
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:48,480
Didn't you ever wonder why
Mameha took you under her wing?

1276
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:54,690
Mameha came to me
because of you.

1277
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,370
I wish you could have told me
long ago.

1278
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:07,580
What could I do?

1279
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,910
I owe Nobu my life.

1280
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:12,330
And so...

1281
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:18,050
...when I saw he had a chance
at happiness with you, I stood silent.

1282
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,340
But...

1283
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:25,430
But I cannot any longer.

1284
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:28,220
I hope...

1285
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,390
...it is not too late.

1286
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:40,110
Don't be afraid to look at me, Chiyo.

1287
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,790
Can't you see?

1288
02:14:56,710 --> 02:14:59,710
Every step I have taken...

1289
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:03,800
...since I was that child
on the bridge...

1290
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:08,220
...has been to bring myself
closer to you.

1291
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:17,170
<i>You cannot say to the sun,
"More sun."</i>

1292
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:20,710
<i>Or to the rain, "Less rain."</i>

1293
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:25,550
<i>To a man, geisha can
only be half a wife.</i>

1294
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:28,890
<i>We are the wives of nightfall.</i>

1295
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:32,430
<i>And yet, to learn of kindness...</i>

1296
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:35,810
<i>... after so much unkindness...</i>

1297
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:41,360
<i>... to understand that a little girl
with more courage than she knew...</i>

1298
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:45,320
<i>... would find her prayers
were answered...</i>

1299
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:49,070
<i>... can that not be called happiness?</i>

1300
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:51,410
<i>After all...</i>

1301
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:57,790
<i>... these are not the memoirs
of an empress, nor of a queen.</i>

1302
02:16:57,790 --> 02:17:02,290
<i>These are memoirs
of another kind.</i>
