1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,296
How do you do?

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:08,134
Mr Carl Laemmle feels
it would be a little unkind

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,764
to present this picture without
just a word of friendly warning.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,100
We are about to unfold
the story of Frankenstein.

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,561
A man of science,

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:22,273
who sought to create
a man after his own image,

7
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:25,026
without reckoning upon God.

8
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:29,781
It is one of the strangest tales ever told.

9
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:33,701
It deals with the two great
mysteries of creation:

10
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,870
life and death.

11
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,499
I think it will thrill you.

12
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:42,126
It may shock you.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,671
It might even horrify you.

14
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,343
So if any of you feel that you do not care
to subject your nerves to such a strain,

15
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,845
now is your chance to, er...

16
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,556
Well, we've warned you.

17
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:07,253
(man)... dona eis, Domine:
et lux perpetua luceat eis.

18
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,422
Amen.

19
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,427
(bell tolls)

20
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,388
(sobbing)

21
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,241
Down. Down, you fool!

22
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,670
Now!

23
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,797
Come on!

24
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,011
Hurry, hurry.

25
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,699
The moon's rising. We've no time to lose.

26
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,451
(clattering)

27
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,620
Careful!

28
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,545
Here he comes!

29
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:07,808
He's just resting.
Waiting for a new life to come.

30
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,042
Here we are.

31
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,260
Look, it's still here.

32
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,056
Climb up and cut the rope.

33
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,017
- No!
- Go on. It can't hurt you.

34
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,396
Here's a knife.

35
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,628
Look out!

36
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,716
Here's the knife.

37
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,884
Here I come.

38
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,265
Is it all right?

39
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,810
The neck's broken. The brain is useless!

40
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,896
We must find another brain.

41
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,533
That'll do, gentlemen.

42
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,378
(laughter)

43
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,348
And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen,

44
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,393
here we have one of the most
perfect specimens of the human brain

45
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,937
ever to come to my attention
at the university.

46
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,524
And here, the abnormal brain
of the typical criminal.

47
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,485
Observe, ladies and gentlemen,

48
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,655
the scarcity of convolutions
on the frontal lobe

49
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,407
as compared to that of the normal brain,

50
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:33,537
and the distinct degeneration
of the middle frontal lobe.

51
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,956
All of these degenerate characteristics

52
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,210
check amazingly with the history
of the dead man before us,

53
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:44,548
whose life was one of brutality,
of violence and murder.

54
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,551
These jars will remain here
for your further inspection.

55
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,554
Thank you, gentlemen.
The class is dismissed.

56
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,857
(cries out)

57
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,828
(gong)

58
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,751
(faint voices)

59
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,235
Herr Victor Moritz.

60
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,907
Victor.

61
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,534
- I'm so glad you've come.
- What is it, Elizabeth?

62
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:39,079
- Oh, you've heard from Henry.
- Yes. The first word in four months.

63
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,624
It just came.

64
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,919
- Victor, you must help me.
- Of course I'll help you.

65
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,922
I'm afraid.

66
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:53,344
I've read this over and over again, but
they're just words that I can't understand.

67
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,553
Listen.

68
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,765
"You must have faith in me,
Elizabeth. Wait."

69
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,101
"My work must come first,
even before you."

70
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,854
"At night, the winds howl
in the mountains."

71
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,981
"There is no one here."

72
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:09,235
"Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."

73
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,904
- What can he mean?
- What does he say then?

74
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,702
"I am living in an abandoned watchtower
close to the town of Goldstadt."

75
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,164
"Only my assistant is here
to help me with my experiments."

76
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:26,544
- Oh. His experiments.
- Yes, that's what frightens me.

77
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,506
The day we announced our engagement,
he told me of his experiments.

78
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,302
He said he was close to a discovery so
terrific that he doubted his own sanity.

79
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:39,223
There was a strange look in his eyes.
Some mystery.

80
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,600
His words carried me right away.

81
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:46,689
Of course, I've never doubted him.
But still, I worry. I can't help it.

82
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,277
And now this letter. All this uncertainty
can't go on. I must know.

83
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,821
Victor, have you seen him?

84
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,365
Yes. About three weeks ago.

85
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,327
I met him walking alone in the woods.
He spoke to me of his work, too.

86
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,038
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.

87
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,083
He just glared at me
and said he would let no one go there.

88
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,045
- His manner was very strange.
- Oh, what can we do?

89
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,715
- If he should be ill!
- Now, don't worry.

90
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,343
I'll go to Dr Waldman,
Henry's old professor in medical school.

91
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,929
Perhaps he can tell me
more about all this.

92
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,973
Victor, you're a dear.

93
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,434
You know I'd go to the ends
of the earth for you.

94
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,604
I shouldn't like that.
I'm far too fond of you.

95
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,106
I wish you were.

96
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,152
- Victor.
- I'm sorry.

97
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,159
Good night, Victor.
And thank you. Thank you.

98
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,913
Good night. And don't worry. Promise?

99
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,081
I won't.

100
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,796
- Victor!
- What is it?

101
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,051
- I'm coming with you.
- You can't!

102
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,637
I must. I'll be ready in a minute.

103
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:09,021
Herr Frankenstein is a most
brilliant young man, yet so erratic.

104
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,190
He troubles me.

105
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,027
I'm worried about Henry.
Why has he left the university?

106
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,697
He was doing so well
and he seemed so happy with his work.

107
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:24,203
You know, his researches in the field
of chemical galvanism and electrobiology

108
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,998
were far in advance of our theories
here at the university.

109
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,876
In fact, they had reached
a most advanced stage.

110
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,253
They were becoming dangerous.

111
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,715
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.

112
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,385
You mean changed
as a result of his work?

113
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,345
Yes. His work.

114
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,889
His insane ambition to create life.

115
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,518
How? How?

116
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,730
Please tell us everything, whatever it is.

117
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,526
The bodies we use now,
dissecting them for lecture purposes,

118
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,821
were not perfect enough
for his experiments, he said.

119
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,615
He wished us to supply him
with other bodies,

120
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,744
and we were not to be too particular
as to where and how we got them.

121
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,289
I told him that his demands
were unreasonable,

122
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,793
and so he left the university
to work unhampered.

123
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,296
- He found what he needed elsewhere.
- Oh. The bodies of animals.

124
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,425
Well, what are the lives
of a few rabbits and dogs?

125
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,969
You do not quite get what I mean.

126
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,390
Herr Frankenstein was
interested only in human life.

127
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:30,310
First to destroy it, then re-create it.

128
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,273
There you have his mad dream.

129
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:40,279
- Can we go to him?
- You will not be very welcome.

130
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,198
What does that matter? I must see him.

131
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:48,912
Dr Waldman, you have influence
with Henry. Won't you come with us?

132
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:53,083
I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein
is no longer my pupil.

133
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,504
But he respects you.
Won't you help us to take him away?

134
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,716
Very well, Fräulein.
I've warned you.

135
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,177
But if you wish it, I will go.

136
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,142
(thunder rumbles)

137
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,369
- Fritz!
- Hello.

138
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,583
- Have you finished those connections?
- Yes, they're done.

139
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,378
Well, come down, then, and help.
We've lots to do.

140
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,648
(thunderclap)

141
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,571
Look out!

142
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,243
Fool!

143
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,453
If this storm develops as I hope,

144
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,873
you will have plenty to be afraid of
before the night's over.

145
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,251
Go on, fix the electrodes.

146
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,594
(crackling)

147
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,515
This storm will be magnificent.

148
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,226
All the electrical secrets of heaven.

149
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,981
And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz? Ready.

150
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,277
Oh!

151
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,445
- Why, what's the matter?
- Look.

152
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,409
There's nothing to fear. Look.

153
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,787
No blood, no decay.

154
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,957
Just a few stitches.

155
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,503
And look. Here's the final touch.

156
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,510
- The brain you stole, Fritz.
- Yes.

157
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,680
Think of it-the brain of a dead man

158
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,392
waiting to live again in a body
I made with my own hands.

159
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,687
With my own hands.

160
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,568
Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.

161
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,737
(thunderclap)

162
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,253
Good.

163
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,590
In 15 minutes, the storm
should be at its height.

164
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,675
Then we'll be ready.

165
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,344
(knocking at door)

166
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,512
What's that?

167
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,893
- There's someone there.
- Shh! Quiet.

168
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,523
Send them away!
Nobody must come here.

169
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,444
Here. Cover this.

170
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,417
Whoever it is, don't let them in.

171
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,586
Leave them to me.

172
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,967
Of all the times
for anybody to come! Now!

173
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,596
- (Fritz mutters)
- (knocking continues)

174
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,225
I'll show them, messing about
at this time of night. Got too much to do.

175
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,478
- (banging at door)
- Wait a minute! All right, all right!

176
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,690
Wait a minute, I'm coming.

177
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,194
- It's Dr Waldman, Fritz.
- You can't see him. Go away.

178
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,782
(knocking continues)

179
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,576
All right, knock! You won't get in.

180
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,293
(mutters)

181
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,670
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

182
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,047
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

183
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,591
Henry!

184
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,303
- (Elizabeth) Open the door!
- (Victor) Let us in!

185
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:18,348
Who is it? What do you want?
You must leave me alone now.

186
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,934
It's Elizabeth! Open the door!

187
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,156
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

188
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,118
- What do you want?
- Open the door!

189
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:42,164
- You must leave me alone.
- (Elizabeth) At least give us shelter.

190
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:53,008
- What's this nonsense of locked doors?
- Henry!

191
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,803
Elizabeth, please, won't you go away?
Won't you trust me just for tonight?

192
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:01,600
- You're ill. What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm quite all right. Truly I am.

193
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,227
Can't you see I mustn't be disturbed?

194
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:08,148
You'll ruin everything.
My experiment is almost completed.

195
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,817
Wait a moment. I understand.

196
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,988
I believe in you.
But I cannot leave you tonight.

197
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:19,117
- You've got to leave!
- Henry, you're inhuman. You're crazy!

198
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,120
Crazy, am I?

199
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,540
We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.

200
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,797
Come on up.

201
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,189
You're quite sure you want to come in?

202
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,403
Very well.

203
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,883
Forgive me, but I'm forced
to take unusual precautions.

204
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,640
Sit down, please.

205
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,644
Sit down!

206
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,485
You too, Elizabeth. Please.

207
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,408
A moment ago, you said I was crazy.

208
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,662
- Tomorrow, we'll see about that.
- (Fritz) Don't touch that!

209
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,831
(thunderclap)

210
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,087
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.

211
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,311
Please.

212
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:18,361
Doctor Waldman, I learnt a great deal
from you at the university

213
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,531
about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray,

214
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,410
which you said was
the highest colour in the spectrum.

215
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,538
You were wrong.

216
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:32,709
Here, in this machinery,
I have gone beyond that.

217
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:39,174
I have discovered the great ray
that first brought life into the world.

218
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,676
Oh. And your proof?

219
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,930
Tonight you shall have your proof.

220
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:50,143
At first I experimented
only with dead animals,

221
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:54,481
and then a human heart, which
I kept beating for three weeks.

222
00:21:55,565 --> 00:22:00,820
But now I'm going to turn
that ray on that body,

223
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,240
and endow it with life.

224
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,618
And you really believe
that you can bring life to the dead?

225
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,205
That body is not dead.

226
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,374
It has never lived.

227
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,920
I created it. I made it with my own hands

228
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,966
from the bodies I took from graves,
from the gallows, anywhere.

229
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,055
Go and see for yourself.

230
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,099
(thunderclap)

231
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,268
You too.

232
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,066
Dead, hey?

233
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,784
Quite a good scene, isn't it?

234
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,245
One man crazy,

235
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,914
three very sane spectators.

236
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,792
(thunderclap)

237
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:57,794
Yes!

238
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,880
Test the batteries.

239
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,115
Look. It's moving.

240
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,244
It's alive. It's alive!

241
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,624
It's alive. It's moving. It's alive!

242
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,503
It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!

243
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,297
- It's alive!
- Henry, in the name of God!

244
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,092
In the name of God?!
Now I know what it...

245
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,636
(voice drowned out by thunder)

246
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,020
Henry is well, but he's very busy.

247
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,273
He said he would
get in touch with you soon.

248
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,526
Don't worry about him, Baron.
He'll be home in a few days.

249
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:30,363
You two have it all arranged,
haven't you?

250
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,449
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

251
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,868
But I'm not.

252
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:38,455
Anyone can see with half an eye
that there's something wrong.

253
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,499
And I've two eyes,
and pretty good ones at that.

254
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,627
- Well, what is it?
- You're quite mistaken, Baron.

255
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,505
What's the matter with my son?
What's he doing?

256
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,674
He's completing his experiments.

257
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:53,094
Why does he go messing around
an old ruined windmill

258
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:57,640
when he has a decent house,
a bath, good food and drink,

259
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:01,936
and a darned pretty girl to come back to?
Would you tell me that?

260
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:05,857
- Baron, you don't understand.
- I understand perfectly well.

261
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,235
There's another woman,
and you're afraid to tell me.

262
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,197
Pretty sordid experiments
these must be. Huh!

263
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,742
- Oh, but you're wrong!
- And how do you know?

264
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,661
If you please, Herr Baron,
the burgomaster.

265
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:22,081
- Well, tell him to go away.
- But he says it's important.

266
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:26,669
Nothing the burgomaster can say
can be of the slightest importance.

267
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,924
Good day, Herr Baron. Fräulein.

268
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,301
Well, what do you want?

269
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,137
If it's trouble, go away.
I've trouble enough.

270
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,766
- Oh, there's no trouble, sir.
- What do you mean, "no trouble"?

271
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,976
There's nothing but trouble.

272
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,897
- I brought you these flowers.
- Thank you, Herr Vogel.

273
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,609
Both in my private and official
capacities as burgomaster...

274
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,571
Yes, yes, yes, we know all about that,
but what do you want?

275
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:58,076
What I really want to know is
when will the wedding be, if you please.

276
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
Unless Henry comes to his senses,
there'll be no wedding at all.

277
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:07,210
- But the village is already prepared.
- Well, tell them to unprepare.

278
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,754
But such a lovely bride...

279
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,757
Such a fine young man,
the very image of his father.

280
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,094
- Heaven forbid.
- But, sir, everything is ready!

281
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:19,556
I know that!
Don't keep on saying so, you idiot!

282
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,808
There's nothing to cry about.

283
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,812
Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
Good day, Herr Moritz.

284
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,648
Good day, Herr Vogel.

285
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,484
Good day, Herr Baron.

286
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,821
And good riddance to you.

287
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:38,116
There you are. Huh! You see how it is.

288
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:42,453
The whole village is kept waiting,
the bride is kept waiting,

289
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:47,709
and I am kept waiting. Henry must
come home, if I have to fetch him myself.

290
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,253
No, no, Baron. What about his work?

291
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,131
Stuff and nonsense.
What about his wedding?

292
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,092
There is another woman...

293
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,261
and I'm going to find her.

294
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,602
(Dr Waldman huffs)

295
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,816
Come and sit down, Doctor.

296
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,777
You must be patient.

297
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,405
Do you expect perfection at once?

298
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,867
This creature of yours
should be kept under guard.

299
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,786
Mark my words, he will prove dangerous.

300
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,290
Dangerous?

301
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,459
Poor old Waldman.

302
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:36,257
Have you never wanted
to do anything that was dangerous?

303
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:40,470
Where should we be if nobody tried
to find out what lies beyond?

304
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,390
Have you never wanted to look
beyond the clouds and the stars?

305
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,560
Or to know what causes the trees to bud?

306
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,605
And what changes
the darkness into light?

307
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:57,028
But if you talk like that...
people call you crazy.

308
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:03,326
Well, if I could discover
just one of these things -

309
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,703
what eternity is, for example -

310
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:10,083
I wouldn't care
if they did think I was crazy.

311
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:14,545
You're young, my friend.
Your success has intoxicated you.

312
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,298
Wake up and look facts in the face!

313
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,635
Here we have a fiend whose brain...

314
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,513
Whose brain must be
given time to develop.

315
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,849
It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.

316
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:30,269
Well, you ought to know.
It came from your own laboratory.

317
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:35,400
The brain that was stolen from
my laboratory was a criminal brain.

318
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:49,163
Oh, well.
After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.

319
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,457
Only evil can come of it.

320
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,585
Your health will be ruined
if you persist in this madness.

321
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,255
I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.

322
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,550
You have created a monster
and it will destroy you.

323
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,219
Patience, patience.

324
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,806
I believe in this monster, as you call it.

325
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,851
And if you don't, well,
you must leave me alone.

326
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,729
But think of Elizabeth. Your father.

327
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,981
Elizabeth believes in me.

328
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,859
My father? He never believes in anyone.

329
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,739
I've got to experiment further.

330
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,366
He's only a few days old, remember.

331
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,953
So far, he's been kept
in complete darkness.

332
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,247
Wait till I bring him into the light.

333
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,416
(footsteps)

334
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,173
Here he comes. Let's turn out the light.

335
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,005
Come in.

336
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,966
Come in.

337
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:47,365
Sit down. Sit down!

338
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,624
You see? It understands.

339
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,377
Watch.

340
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:46,340
(Waldman) Take care now,
Frankenstein. Take care.

341
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,512
Shut out the light.

342
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,490
Sit down.

343
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,369
Go and sit down.

344
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,768
- It understands this time. It's wonderful.
- Frankenstein, where is it?!

345
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,186
Aagh!

346
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,355
Quiet, you fool!

347
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,193
Get away with that torch.

348
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,543
- Aagh!
- Quick!

349
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,879
Fetch the rope, quick.

350
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,756
Stop pushing.

351
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,842
- Get him to the cellar.
- Shoot it! It's a monster.

352
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,264
(clanking chains)

353
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,432
(howling)

354
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,067
Quiet. Quiet!

355
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,409
Stop that! You'll have
the whole countryside on us!

356
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,953
Come away.
He has the strength of ten men!

357
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,080
(monster yells)

358
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,249
Here, give me that!

359
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,752
Come away, Fritz.

360
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,964
Leave it alone. Leave it alone.

361
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,317
(yelling)

362
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,032
(screaming)

363
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,618
Listen. What's that? Who's there?

364
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,499
(yelling)

365
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,877
It's Fritz!

366
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,425
(monster growls)

367
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,386
Come on, Doctor. Quick, hurry.

368
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,477
(growls)

369
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,437
Get back.

370
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,440
- (growls)
- Get out!

371
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,318
Come on, quickly.

372
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,868
(growling)

373
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,083
(banging on door)

374
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,379
(banging continues)

375
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,094
He hated Fritz.
Fritz always tormented him.

376
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,808
Come, pull yourself together.

377
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:27,311
- What can we do?
- Kill it, as you would any savage animal.

378
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,523
We must overpower him first.
Get me a hypodermic needle.

379
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,691
- It's murder.
- It's our only chance.

380
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:36,737
In a few minutes, he'll be through
that door. Come, quick. Hurry.

381
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,324
(banging on door continues)

382
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,834
- Got it?
- Yes, here it is.

383
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,587
- It's very strong. Half-grain solution.
- Good. Now then.

384
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:59,385
You stand there. When he goes toward
you, I will make the injection in his back.

385
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,847
- Ready?
- Yes.

386
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,611
(growls)

387
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,621
Aagh!

388
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,624
Get back! Back!

389
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,736
(knock at door)

390
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,909
Dr Waldman. Dr Waldman!

391
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,829
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right. It's nothing.

392
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,998
See who's at the door.

393
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,505
What's happening? Elizabeth and
your father are coming to see you.

394
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,173
- Keep them out.
- Too late!

395
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:22,051
They must not see that.
Here, quick, give me a hand.

396
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,220
Quick!

397
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:43,155
Henry, hurry, get that blood off your face
before your father and Elizabeth get here.

398
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,706
Well, er...

399
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,210
Pretty sort of place for
my son to be in, I must say.

400
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:00,297
- Is that the front door?
- Yes, this is it.

401
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,216
Right.

402
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,468
I don't like it, but...

403
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,637
here goes.

404
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,475
(tuts)

405
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:14,395
There doesn't seem to be
anybody in the place.

406
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,900
God...

407
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:26,991
What a... What a forsaken place.

408
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:30,369
Are you trying to burn it down, eh?
What's that for, eh?

409
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:34,373
Well, what's the matter with you? You
look as if you've been kicked by a horse.

410
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,458
- Where's Henry?
- Why...

411
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,003
- Well?
- He can't be disturbed just now.

412
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,298
Oh, can't he? Huh!
I'll soon settle that nonsense.

413
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,841
Victor, where is he?

414
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,427
This place seems
to drive everybody crazy.

415
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,221
- (banging)
- Oh, heavens... What's that?

416
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,433
I beg your pardon. I am Dr Waldman.

417
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:55,853
Oh, are you? I'm Baron Frankenstein.

418
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,856
Perhaps you know what
all this tommyrot's about.

419
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,984
I... (splutters) I'll be shot if I do!

420
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,570
I advise you to take
Henry away from here at once.

421
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,573
Well, what do you suppose
I'm here for? Pleasure?

422
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,782
Nah.

423
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,452
Where are you, my dear?
Oh, there you are.

424
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,704
Let's see what's up the awful stairs.

425
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:17,416
I don't know how the deuce
I'm going to get up 'em, but...

426
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,752
(Baron mutters)

427
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,129
Leave them alone.

428
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:26,383
No banisters or anything else...
How much further?

429
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:31,096
Come in.

430
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,100
- Henry.
- Elizabeth.

431
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,356
Henry!

432
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,734
Victor! Dr Waldman! Come quickly.

433
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:48,864
- My dear, what have they done to you?
- Poor Fritz... It's all my fault...

434
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,033
Get him on the sofa.

435
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,462
Have you got any brandy?

436
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,300
Quick, quick, quick.

437
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,430
Here, I'll do that.

438
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,474
My boy... Now, now...

439
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,351
Now drink. Drink this.

440
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,773
There. There, that's better.

441
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,651
I'm going to take
you home with me, Henry.

442
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:30,072
No, I can't. My work. What will happen
to the records of my experiment?

443
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,157
- We will preserve them.
- And...

444
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,868
I will see that it is painlessly destroyed.

445
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:37,371
Yes, yes. Leave it all to me.

446
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,832
Poor Fritz. All my fault.

447
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,292
There, Henry.
You can't do any more now.

448
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,087
You must come home
until you get well again.

449
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,881
You'll soon feel better
when you get out of here.

450
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:07,127
(gags)

451
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,840
(chokes)

452
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:00,472
It's like heaven being with you again.

453
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:03,016
Heaven wasn't so far away
all the time, you know.

454
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,686
I know. But I didn't realise it.

455
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,524
My work. Those horrible days and nights.

456
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,694
I couldn't think of anything else.

457
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,989
Henry, you're not to think
of those things any more.

458
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,158
- You promised.
- All right.

459
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:23,662
Let's think about us.
When will our wedding be?

460
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,792
Let's make it soon.

461
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,961
As soon as you like.

462
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,845
For three generations,

463
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:44,224
these orange blossoms
have been worn at our weddings.

464
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,019
Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.

465
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:51,023
Looks as good as new now, hey?

466
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:55,527
And here. Here is one to make
the best man look still better.

467
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:02,034
30 years ago, I placed this
on your mother's head, Henry.

468
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:08,040
Today, you'll make me very happy
by doing the same for Elizabeth.

469
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,126
And I hope, in 30 years' time,

470
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,671
a youngster of yours
will be carrying on the tradition.

471
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,508
And now, how about a little drink, eh?

472
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:24,181
My grandfather bought this wine
and laid it down.

473
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,728
My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it.
Bless her heart.

474
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,272
Here's to your very good health.

475
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:35,359
Well, are you all full?
Yes? Come along.

476
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:39,738
Here's a health to a son
of the House of Frankenstein.

477
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,491
(all) A son to the House
of Frankenstein.

478
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:47,037
Here's a jolly good health
to young Frankenstein.

479
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,206
(all) Young Frankenstein.

480
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,004
Give the servants some champagne.
This stuff's wasted on 'em.

481
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:59,424
Well, well, well.

482
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:05,180
(Baron) Go on, mop it up.
It'll do you good.

483
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:09,184
- House of Frankenstein.
- To the House of Frankenstein.

484
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:12,270
Now then. Now be off
about your business.

485
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:21,613
- (merriment outside)
- Listen! Listen to 'em!

486
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:26,284
The boys and girls of the village
are out here.

487
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,000
(cheering and singing)

488
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:42,217
It's extraordinary how friendly
you can make a lot of people

489
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,553
on a couple of bottles of beer.

490
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:47,139
Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.

491
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,307
No doubt!

492
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:52,144
- They're calling for you, Baron.
- Hey-ho.

493
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:54,563
Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.

494
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:57,524
(cheering)

495
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,612
Quiet!

496
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,948
Thank you all very much indeed.

497
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,493
I'm very pleased to see you all,
and I hope there's plenty of beer.

498
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,996
There's lots more where that came from.

499
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,040
(cheering)

500
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,535
You stay here, Maria.
I'll just take a look at my traps.

501
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:54,414
Then we'll go to the village
and have a grand time, huh?

502
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,333
- You won't be long, Daddy?
- Oh, no.

503
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,419
If Franz comes by,
tell him I'll be back soon.

504
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:02,464
Daddy, won't you stay
and play with me a little while?

505
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,716
I'm too busy, darling.

506
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,385
You stay and play with the kitty, huh?

507
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,138
- Bye, Daddy.
- Goodbye.

508
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:11,973
Be a good girl now.

509
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,935
Come on, kitty.

510
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:47,551
Who are you? I'm Maria.

511
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,388
Will you play with me?

512
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,280
Would you like one of my flowers?

513
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,681
You have those, and I'll have these.

514
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,273
I can make a boat.

515
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,154
See how mine float?

516
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,749
Ohh!

517
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,968
No, you're hurting me! No!

518
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,618
(? Bavarian folk music)

519
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:24,165
- Henry.
- Elizabeth!

520
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,420
How lovely you look.
But you shouldn't be here.

521
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:30,588
I must see you for a minute.

522
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,678
Why? What's the matter?

523
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:44,060
Could you leave us for a moment?

524
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:46,771
Why, of course.

525
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,032
- Why, what is it?
- I'm so glad you're safe.

526
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,326
Safe? Of course I'm safe.

527
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:02,537
But you look worried. Is anything wrong?

528
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,289
No.

529
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,666
No, forget my foolishness.

530
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,252
It was just a mood.
There's nothing the matter.

531
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:11,421
Of course there isn't!

532
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:15,258
Henry, I'm afraid. Terribly afraid.

533
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,428
Where is Dr Waldman?
Why is he late for the wedding?

534
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,181
He's always late. He'll be here soon.

535
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,351
Something is going to happen.

536
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:27,395
I feel it. I can't get it out of my mind.

537
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,814
You're just nervous.

538
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:32,108
All the excitement and preparation.

539
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,821
No. No, it isn't that. I've felt it all day.

540
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,200
Something is coming between us.

541
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,660
I know it. I know it!

542
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,747
Sit down and rest. You look so tired.

543
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:51,795
- If I could just save us from it.
- From what, dear? From what?

544
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,589
I don't know!

545
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,968
If I could just get it out of my mind!
I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.

546
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:01,721
Lose me? Why, I'll always be with you.

547
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,808
Will you, Henry? Are you sure?

548
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,269
I love you so.

549
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:12,399
Sure. How beautiful you look.

550
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,360
Henry! Henry! (knocking at door)

551
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,904
What's that? What's that?!

552
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,073
Henry! Dr Waldman!

553
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:24,327
- What about Dr Waldman?
- Henry, don't leave me!

554
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:27,997
- No, darling, you stay here.
- Henry! Henry!

555
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,500
Dr Waldman's been
murdered in the tower.

556
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,418
The monster.

557
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,546
He's been seen in the hills,
terrorising the mountainside.

558
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:35,839
(moaning)

559
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,425
He's in the house.

560
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:40,593
He's upstairs!

561
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,224
(bells ring out)

562
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,393
(agitated shouting outside)

563
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,371
(moaning)

564
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,540
It's in the cellars.

565
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:46,326
(moans)

566
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:47,535
(screams)

567
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:50,163
- (mimics scream)
- (screams)

568
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,503
(Elizabeth continues screaming)

569
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,131
It's Elizabeth! Come on.

570
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,139
(clattering)

571
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,730
Elizabeth!

572
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,066
What is it?

573
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:24,948
- Don't let him come here.
- No, no, no, darling. It's all right.

574
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,577
- Don't let him come here.
- It's all right, darling. It's all right.

575
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,218
Oh, look! That's Maria!

576
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,014
(cheering)

577
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,741
Silence! Silence! Silence!

578
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,618
What is it?

579
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:54,787
Maria. She's drowned.

580
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,083
My poor man.
Why do you bring her here to me?

581
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,753
But... But she has been murdered.

582
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,588
(shouting)

583
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:10,303
Silence! I'll see that justice is done.

584
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,388
Who is it?

585
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:24,025
- How is Elizabeth now?
- I don't know.

586
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:28,404
She's still in a daze. Just looks at me
and says nothing. It's maddening.

587
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,740
Easy, old man. She'll be all right.

588
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,784
- Our wedding day.
- Steady.

589
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,119
Your wedding will be
postponed a day at most.

590
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:38,873
- A day? I wonder.
- What do you mean?

591
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:43,169
There can be no wedding while this
horrible creation of mine is still alive.

592
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,673
I made him with these hands,
and with these hands I will destroy him.

593
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:48,633
- I must find him!
- I'll go with you.

594
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:51,844
No. You stay here and look after Elizabeth.

595
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:57,392
I'll leave her in your care, whatever
happens. You understand? In your care.

596
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:02,897
(angry shouting)

597
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:09,112
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

598
00:58:09,946 --> 00:58:11,114
Ludwig.

599
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:14,575
You will search the woods.
Those are your group.

600
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,870
- We'll get him!
- Quiet!

601
00:58:17,954 --> 00:58:19,914
Herr Frankenstein.

602
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:24,085
You will take to the mountains.
Those are your people.

603
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,005
I... I will lead the third group by the lake.

604
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:33,678
And remember... remember...
get him alive if you can,

605
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,097
but get him!

606
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:41,018
Quiet! Search every ravine,
every crevasse,

607
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:43,187
but the fiend must be found!

608
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:46,941
Are you ready?

609
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,569
Light your torches and go!

610
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,135
Stop!

611
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:57,970
Frankenstein, mountains!

612
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,764
Ludwig!

613
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:02,266
Lake party, this way!

614
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,349
Come on, boys! Keep together.

615
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:46,102
You search there.
The rest, come with me.

616
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:00,867
(yells)

617
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,911
Look lively! Come on! Come on!

618
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:09,125
Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!

619
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,336
(moaning)

620
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:18,384
Come on, men! Quick! This way!

621
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:26,559
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go? Tell me! Tell me!

622
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,894
Over there.

623
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:30,062
You stay here and take care of him.

624
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:33,608
The rest, follow me.
Come on! Come on, quick!

625
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:56,631
No, come back! This way.

626
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:12,271
Herr Frankenstein!

627
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:14,690
Herr Frankenstein, where are you?

628
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:20,363
I think he's up there. Come on, follow me.

629
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,406
Quick!

630
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,252
Hello!

631
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:44,178
Fire. Fire!

632
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,265
Help! Help!

633
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:53,396
- Listen.
- (Herr Frankenstein) Help!

634
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,564
It's Frankenstein.

635
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:57,733
That way!

636
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,427
This way! Come on, hurry! Hurry!

637
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,266
Look, they're there!
Turn the hounds loose!

638
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,546
(yells)

639
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:58,229
(yells)

640
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,627
There he is! The murderer.

641
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,792
He's alive.

642
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,961
Frankenstein!

643
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,547
Frankenstein.

644
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,303
Bring him down to the village
and let's take him home.

645
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,266
Murderer!

646
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,315
Burn the mill!

647
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,285
Burn the mill! He can't get away!

648
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,629
(screams)

649
01:07:08,484 --> 01:07:10,653
(continues screaming)

650
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,330
Aaagh!

651
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,672
(hounds howling)

652
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,897
Have you got it? Come on, hurry.

653
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:49,483
(whispering and giggling)

654
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:56,782
Quiet, quiet.

655
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,619
Well, go ahead and knock.

656
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:09,670
Well, well, well, what's all this?

657
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,839
What do you want, hey?

658
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,882
What's this?

659
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:15,843
If you please, Herr Baron,

660
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:20,973
we thought that Mr Henry could do with
a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.

661
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:23,684
Fine old lady, my grandmother.

662
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:29,565
Very foreseeing of her
to prevent my grandfather drinking this.

663
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:39,825
Mr Henry doesn't need this.

664
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:44,455
As I said before, I say again,

665
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:49,043
here's to a son
to the House of Frankenstein.

666
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,004
(all) Yes, indeed, sir. We hope so, sir.
