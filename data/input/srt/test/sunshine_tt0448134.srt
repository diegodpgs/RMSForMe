1
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,540
Our sun is dying.

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:40,540
   

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,127
Mankind faces extinction.

4
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:44,127
   

5
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,800
Seven years ago, the Icarus Project
sent a mission to restart the sun.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:50,800
   

7
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,762
But that mission was lost
before it reached the star.

8
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:54,762
   

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,102
Sixteen months ago, I, Robert Capa,
and a crew of seven...

10
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:01,102
   

11
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,564
...left Earth frozen in a solar winter.

12
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:04,564
   

13
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,483
Our payload...

14
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:07,483
   

15
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,572
...a stellar bomb with a mass
equivalent to Manhattan Island.

16
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:12,572
   

17
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,408
Our purpose...

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:15,408
   

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,662
...to create a star within a star.

20
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:19,662
   

21
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,691
Eight astronauts strapped
to the back of a bomb.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:48,691
   

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,651
My bomb.

24
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:50,651
   

25
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,405
Welcome to Icarus II.

26
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:54,405
   

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,147
Icarus.

28
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,147
   

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,733
Yes, Dr. Searle?

30
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:30,733
   

31
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,403
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

32
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:34,403
   

33
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,199
Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?

34
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,199
   

35
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,493
Down.

36
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:40,493
   

37
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,499
Oh, my.

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:46,499
   

39
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,131
Icarus, how close is this
to full brightness?

40
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:54,131
   

41
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,636
At this distance of 36 million miles...

42
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:58,636
   

43
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,558
...you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.

44
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:03,558
   

45
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,934
Two percent?

46
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:04,934
   

47
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,104
Can you show me 4 percent?

48
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:08,104
   

49
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,692
Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.

50
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:12,692
   

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,952
However, you could observe
3.1 percent...

52
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:22,952
   

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,122
...for a period of not longer than
30 seconds.

54
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:26,122
   

55
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,292
All right. Icarus, I'm gonna reset...

56
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,292
   

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,588
...the filter to 3.1 percent.

58
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:33,588
   

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,585
Well, it's invigorating.

60
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:12,585
   

61
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,588
It's like taking a shower in light.

62
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:15,588
   

63
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,841
-You lose yourself a little.
-Like a flotation tank.

64
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:18,841
   

65
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,051
Actually, no.

66
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,051
   

67
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,933
Look, what is it, beef?

68
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:26,933
   

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,476
Chicken.

70
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:28,476
   

71
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,020
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,020
   

73
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,357
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

74
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:34,357
   

75
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,984
Testing total darkness
on flotation tanks.

76
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:36,984
   

77
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,030
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,030
   

79
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,033
You and the darkness are distinct
from each other...

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,033
   

81
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,287
...because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

82
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:48,287
   

83
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,499
But total light, it envelops you.

84
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:51,499
   

85
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,292
It becomes you.

86
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:53,292
   

87
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,797
It's very strange. I don't...

88
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:57,797
   

89
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,091
I recommend it.

90
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:00,091
   

91
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,094
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer...

92
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:03,094
   

93
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,596
...and I'm clearly a lot saner
than you are.

94
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:05,596
   

95
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,517
Good.

96
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:09,517
   

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,534
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

98
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:26,534
   

99
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:31,038
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

100
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:31,038
   

101
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,417
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

102
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:34,417
   

103
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,086
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference...

104
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:37,086
   

105
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,131
...and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

106
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:40,131
   

107
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:45,553
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

108
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:45,553
   

109
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,221
Possible?

110
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:47,221
   

111
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,016
Probable.

112
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,016
   

113
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,103
We'll finally be on our own.

114
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,103
   

115
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,523
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

116
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:57,523
   

117
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,860
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,860
   

119
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,112
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone...

120
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,112
   

121
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,656
...seven days sooner
than we thought.

122
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:05,656
   

123
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:10,036
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

124
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,036
   

125
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,329
...you should do it now.

126
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:12,329
   

127
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,468
Well, Mom and Dad.

128
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:25,468
   

129
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,764
I hope you're proud of your son...

130
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:29,764
   

131
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,767
...saving mankind and so on.

132
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:32,767
   

133
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,925
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

134
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:05,925
   

135
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,804
It came a little sooner
than we thought.

136
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:09,804
   

137
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,183
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

138
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,183
   

139
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:20,106
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

140
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,106
   

141
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,777
Because I know everything
you wanna say.

142
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:24,777
   

143
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:38,624
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

144
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:38,624
   

145
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,876
Which means you'll know
we've succeeded...

146
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:40,876
   

147
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,296
...about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

148
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:44,296
   

149
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:49,009
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

150
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:49,009
   

151
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,514
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day...

152
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:53,514
   

153
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,683
...you'll know we made it.

154
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:55,683
   

155
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,562
Okay.

156
00:07:59,562 --> 00:07:59,562
   

157
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,647
I'm signing out.

158
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:01,647
   

159
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,984
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

160
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:04,984
   

161
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,576
Icarus, dial it down a little, will you?

162
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:55,576
   

163
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,995
Yes, Corazon.

164
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:57,995
   

165
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,918
Captain?

166
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:04,918
   

167
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,553
I'm guessing you've been
talking to Searle.

168
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:14,553
   

169
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,099
-So, do you have that report for me?
-Yeah.

170
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:19,099
   

171
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,559
Right here.

172
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:20,559
   

173
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:26,065
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

174
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,065
   

175
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,943
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

176
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:28,943
   

177
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,822
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

178
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:33,822
   

179
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,661
You're thinking about Icarus I.

180
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:38,661
   

181
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,499
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up...

182
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:43,499
   

183
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,627
...I don't think
it was a lack of oxygen.

184
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:46,627
   

185
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,797
Not on the outward journey,
at any rate.

186
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:49,797
   

187
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,816
Fuck.

188
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:52,816
   

189
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,851
-Mace.
-Mace.

190
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:02,851
   

191
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,020
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

192
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,020
   

193
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,064
-Fuck.
-Relax. Put it down.

194
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,064
   

195
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,315
You son of a bitch.

196
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:08,315
   

197
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,278
-Fucker took an hour in there.
-Stop.

198
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:12,278
   

199
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,780
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

200
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:14,780
   

201
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,367
-Calm down.
-I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.

202
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:18,367
   

203
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,370
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

204
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,370
   

205
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,289
What's up?

206
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:23,289
   

207
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,584
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

208
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:27,584
   

209
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,631
So how does this work?

210
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:32,631
   

211
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,050
Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?

212
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,050
   

213
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,345
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

214
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:38,345
   

215
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,561
It's the time.

216
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:45,561
   

217
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,734
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

218
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:51,734
   

219
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,694
You just...

220
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:53,694
   

221
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,946
...lose track.

222
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:55,946
   

223
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,536
I know I fucked up.

224
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:02,536
   

225
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,502
From now on...

226
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:10,502
   

227
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,380
...I'm not gonna lose track again.

228
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,380
   

229
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,925
Prescription...

230
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:16,925
   

231
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,429
...Earth Room.

232
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:20,429
   

233
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,972
Two hours?

234
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:21,972
   

235
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,893
-And get a haircut, Mace.
-Yeah.

236
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:25,893
   

237
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,784
Bring back the waves.

238
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:41,784
   

239
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,829
Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.

240
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,829
   

241
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,664
The waves make me feel peaceful.

242
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:47,664
   

243
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,176
Again.

244
00:11:59,176 --> 00:11:59,176
   

245
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,905
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

246
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:19,905
   

247
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,409
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

248
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:23,409
   

249
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,369
All right.

250
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:25,369
   

251
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,668
-Was that the apology?
-Yeah.

252
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:32,668
   

253
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,254
-Consider it accepted.
-Okay.

254
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:35,254
   

255
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,074
It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant...

256
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,074
   

257
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:09,413
...which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.

258
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:09,413
   

259
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,623
None bigger than a raindrop...

260
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:11,623
   

261
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
...but we had 19 punctures...

262
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:13,375
   

263
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,879
...and a secondary contact
to the engine compartment.

264
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:16,879
   

265
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,756
Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.

266
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:19,756
   

267
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,759
Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.

268
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:22,759
   

269
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,013
I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.

270
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,013
   

271
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,057
Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...

272
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:29,057
   

273
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,602
It was...

274
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:31,602
   

275
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,729
...beautiful.

276
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:33,729
   

277
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,774
Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...

278
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:37,774
   

279
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,319
It was...

280
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:40,319
   

281
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,613
...beautiful.

282
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:42,613
   

283
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,881
-Mace?
-Yeah.

284
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:00,881
   

285
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,009
Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes...

286
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,009
   

287
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,596
...for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.

288
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:07,596
   

289
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,724
Shit.

290
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:10,724
   

291
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,917
Guys...

292
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:36,917
   

293
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,961
...you wanna see something?

294
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:38,961
   

295
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,092
Well, I should have
a few words to say...

296
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:45,092
   

297
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,135
...but on reflection...

298
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:47,135
   

299
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,804
...what can one say?

300
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:48,804
   

301
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,139
Ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:51,139
   

303
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,183
Mercury.

304
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,183
   

305
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,825
Twenty-three hours ago,
on the comms systems...

306
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:33,825
   

307
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,702
While listening to your space music?

308
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:35,702
   

309
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,289
... while scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

310
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:39,289
   

311
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,502
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

312
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:43,502
   

313
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,337
The iron content of the planet...

314
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:45,337
   

315
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,880
...is acting as an antenna.

316
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:46,880
   

317
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,550
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

318
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,550
   

319
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,513
Icarus, please play audio file 7-5/B.

320
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:54,513
   

321
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,765
Yes, Harvey.

322
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:56,765
   

323
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,408
End file.

324
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:14,408
   

325
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,993
What is it?

326
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:16,993
   

327
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,371
It's the Icarus I.

328
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:19,371
   

329
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,083
That signal is their distress beacon.

330
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,083
   

331
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,543
Jesus.

332
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:24,543
   

333
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,795
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

334
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:26,795
   

335
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,548
Clearly it's not impossible
because you can hear it.

336
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:29,548
   

337
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,758
-They're still alive?
-We don't know.

338
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:31,758
   

339
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,136
But they could be.
Oxygen is self-replenishing.

340
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,136
   

341
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,887
Water is recycled.

342
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:35,887
   

343
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,848
They have the solar power
they need.

344
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:37,848
   

345
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,726
What about food?
Their supplies couldn't last.

346
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:40,726
   

347
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,269
That depends.

348
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:42,269
   

349
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,896
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

350
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:44,896
   

351
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,149
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

352
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:47,149
   

353
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,317
We don't know what happened
to Icarus l.

354
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:49,317
   

355
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,611
There might have been an accident.

356
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:51,611
   

357
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,989
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

358
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:53,989
   

359
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:58,118
-Captain, do we know where they are?
-Well done, Capa. That is the question.

360
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:58,118
   

361
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,871
Icarus.

362
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:00,871
   

363
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,916
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

364
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:04,916
   

365
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,043
Yes, captain.

366
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:07,043
   

367
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,049
Now plot the source
of the Icarus I beacon.

368
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:13,049
   

369
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,223
Jesus. They almost made it.

370
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:20,223
   

371
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,851
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

372
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:22,851
   

373
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,188
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

374
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:26,188
   

375
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,856
We're gonna pass right by them.

376
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:27,856
   

377
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,359
Within 10 or 15 thousand miles.

378
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:31,359
   

379
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,528
Can anyone survive?

380
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:33,528
   

381
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,239
If the shield is intact.

382
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:36,239
   

383
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,700
We'll be able to see them?

384
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,700
   

385
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,036
Yes.

386
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,036
   

387
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:45,123
I'd need to look at all of this
pretty carefully. Very carefully.

388
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:45,123
   

389
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:50,545
But if I had to make a guess right now,
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

390
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:50,545
   

391
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,422
We could fly straight to them.

392
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:52,422
   

393
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,174
But we're not gonna do that.

394
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:54,174
   

395
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,598
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

396
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:01,598
   

397
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,229
Do I have to spell it out for you?

398
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:07,229
   

399
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,357
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

400
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:10,357
   

401
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,943
We're doing it
because that star is dying.

402
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:12,943
   

403
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,986
And if it dies, we die.

404
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:14,986
   

405
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,488
Everything dies.

406
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:16,488
   

407
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,573
So that is our mission.
There is nothing...

408
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:18,573
   

409
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,410
...literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

410
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:22,410
   

411
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,038
-He's right.
-He's right. Of course I'm right.

412
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,038
   

413
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,499
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

414
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:27,499
   

415
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,376
-May I put a counter argument?
-No.

416
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:29,376
   

417
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,919
Captain?

418
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:30,919
   

419
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,212
Go ahead.

420
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:32,212
   

421
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,090
It would, of course...

422
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,090
   

423
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,678
...be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the Icarus I.

424
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:39,678
   

425
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,223
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive...

426
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:43,223
   

427
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:48,770
...their lives are expendable
when seen in the context of our mission.

428
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:48,770
   

429
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,939
As are our own lives.

430
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:50,939
   

431
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,691
-Exactly.
-However...

432
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:52,691
   

433
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,112
...there is something onboard the
Icarus I that may be worth the detour.

434
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:57,112
   

435
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,906
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

436
00:19:59,906 --> 00:19:59,906
   

437
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,116
A payload. Singular.

438
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,116
   

439
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,828
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload...

440
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:04,828
   

441
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,581
...is entirely theoretical.

442
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:07,581
   

443
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,416
Simply put...

444
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:09,416
   

445
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,960
...we don't know if it's gonna work.

446
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:11,960
   

447
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,338
But what we do know is this...

448
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:15,338
   

449
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,884
...if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

450
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:18,884
   

451
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,928
You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.

452
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:21,928
   

453
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,138
-Yes.
-Which is assuming...

454
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:23,138
   

455
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:27,767
...that whatever stopped them wasn't
a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.

456
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:27,767
   

457
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,895
-Yes.
-It's a lot of assumptions.

458
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:29,895
   

459
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,104
It is.

460
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,104
   

461
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,564
It's a risk assessment.

462
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:32,564
   

463
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,773
The question is:

464
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:33,773
   

465
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,861
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

466
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:37,861
   

467
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,413
-We'll have a vote.
-No, no.

468
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:48,413
   

469
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,248
No, we won't.

470
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:50,248
   

471
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,084
We are not a democracy.

472
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:53,084
   

473
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,631
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

474
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:57,631
   

475
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,259
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

476
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:01,259
   

477
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,719
Made by you, by any chance?

478
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:02,719
   

479
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,097
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities...

480
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:06,097
   

481
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,224
...of a payload delivery.

482
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:08,224
   

483
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,143
Our physicist.

484
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:10,143
   

485
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,819
Shit.

486
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:19,819
   

487
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:29,204
Okay, Icarus, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.

488
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:29,204
   

489
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,706
Okay, payload delivery point reached.

490
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:31,706
   

491
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,999
Detach the payload.

492
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:32,999
   

493
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,586
Stellar bomb initiated and detached.

494
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:36,586
   

495
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,214
Crew and living section
have four minutes...

496
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:39,214
   

497
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,217
...to clear and commence
homeward journey.

498
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:42,217
   

499
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:47,222
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

500
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:47,222
   

501
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,143
Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.

502
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:52,143
   

503
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,813
Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.

504
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:54,813
   

505
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,648
Magnetic field structure open.

506
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:56,648
   

507
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,401
Temperature, 37,000.

508
00:21:59,401 --> 00:21:59,401
   

509
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,279
Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.

510
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:03,279
   

511
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,992
Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.

512
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:06,992
   

513
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,743
Variables infinite.

514
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:08,743
   

515
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,245
Accuracy unknown.

516
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:10,245
   

517
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,038
That's the problem right there.

518
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:12,038
   

519
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,582
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun...

520
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:14,582
   

521
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,584
...the velocity will be so great...

522
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:16,584
   

523
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,087
...space and time
will become smeared together.

524
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,087
   

525
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,382
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

526
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:22,382
   

527
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,343
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

528
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:25,343
   

529
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,514
-I need a decision.
-It's not a decision, it's a guess.

530
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:29,514
   

531
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,060
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

532
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,060
   

533
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,563
And?

534
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:36,563
   

535
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,024
Heads.

536
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,024
   

537
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,490
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

538
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:47,490
   

539
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,535
There's not gonna be
another payload.

540
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:50,535
   

541
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,956
The one we carry is our last chance.

542
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:54,956
   

543
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,877
Our last best hope.

544
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:58,877
   

545
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,841
Searle's argument is sound.

546
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:04,841
   

547
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,135
Two last hopes are better than one.

548
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:07,135
   

549
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,638
That's it.

550
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:10,638
   

551
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,282
Slingshot complete.

552
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:29,282
   

553
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,577
Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.

554
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:32,577
   

555
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,983
Hey.

556
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:03,983
   

557
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,032
Good dream?

558
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:11,032
   

559
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,493
Let me guess.

560
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:13,493
   

561
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,787
The surface of the sun?

562
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:15,787
   

563
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,707
Only dream I ever have.

564
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:19,707
   

565
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,670
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

566
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:23,670
   

567
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,966
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

568
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:27,966
   

569
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,219
See if he can help you out.

570
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:31,219
   

571
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,473
Maybe.

572
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:35,473
   

573
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,396
I just wanted to let you know...

574
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:41,396
   

575
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,524
...l think you made the right decision.

576
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:44,524
   

577
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,152
Well.

578
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,152
   

579
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:54,200
Mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

580
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,200
   

581
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,827
Yeah...

582
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:55,827
   

583
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,996
...but I do.

584
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:57,996
   

585
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,774
-Get the alarm. What's going on?
-I screwed up.

586
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:26,774
   

587
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,860
It's not you. It's my responsibility.

588
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:28,860
   

589
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,279
-We shouldn't be straying.
-Trey, cut to it.

590
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,279
   

591
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,866
In order to change the route,
I had to manually override Icarus.

592
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:34,866
   

593
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,703
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double- and triple-checked them.

594
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:38,703
   

595
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,079
They all worked out.

596
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,079
   

597
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,208
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

598
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:43,208
   

599
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,585
What's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

600
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:45,585
   

601
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,003
The trajectory is good.

602
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,003
   

603
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,841
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1.1degrees.

604
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:51,841
   

605
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,802
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

606
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:54,802
   

607
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,391
Jesus Christ, Trey.

608
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:00,391
   

609
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,727
I forgot.

610
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:02,727
   

611
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,735
My head was full of velocities and fuel
calculations and a million different...

612
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:10,735
   

613
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,696
I forgot, all right?

614
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:13,696
   

615
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,200
People do shit.

616
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,200
   

617
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,118
They get stressed...

618
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:19,118
   

619
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,913
...and fuck up.

620
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:21,913
   

621
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,957
I fucked up.

622
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:23,957
   

623
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,959
Trey.

624
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:25,959
   

625
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,800
The fact is, we're still alive.

626
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:33,800
   

627
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,470
A hole hasn't burnt
in the side of the ship.

628
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:37,470
   

629
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,764
We don't have
a 10,000-degree climate.

630
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:39,764
   

631
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,809
-So, what's the actual damage?
-We don't know.

632
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:42,809
   

633
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,521
Icarus tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.

634
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:46,521
   

635
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,773
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

636
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:48,773
   

637
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,526
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

638
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:51,526
   

639
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,071
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

640
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,071
   

641
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,283
Okay.

642
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:58,283
   

643
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,285
I'll get suited up.

644
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:00,285
   

645
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,370
It's a two-man job.

646
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:02,370
   

647
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,123
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

648
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:05,123
   

649
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,292
-I volunteer.
-No, I volunteer.

650
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:07,292
   

651
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,210
Fine.

652
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,210
   

653
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,546
I volunteer Capa.

654
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:11,546
   

655
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,218
Sure.

656
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:17,218
   

657
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,761
I'll do it.

658
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:18,761
   

659
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,448
Okay.

660
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:22,448
   

661
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,751
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

662
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:31,751
   

663
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,003
Yeah.

664
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:34,003
   

665
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,922
You're gonna be fine.

666
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:35,922
   

667
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,131
Okay?

668
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:37,131
   

669
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,728
Okay, Icarus.

670
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:50,728
   

671
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,897
I'm gonna be taking
control for a while.

672
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:52,897
   

673
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,358
-Okay, Cassie.
-I'm gonna be cutting speed.

674
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:55,358
   

675
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,528
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

676
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:58,528
   

677
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,030
-Do we understand each other?
-Yes, Cassie.

678
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,030
   

679
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,367
Rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose Comm Towers 3 and 4.

680
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:04,367
   

681
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,036
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

682
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,036
   

683
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,914
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

684
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:09,914
   

685
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,125
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

686
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,125
   

687
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,920
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

688
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:15,920
   

689
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,255
All right, guys.

690
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:17,255
   

691
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,173
I'm opening up.

692
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:19,173
   

693
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,374
Okay.

694
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:53,374
   

695
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,424
Helmet-cam operational.

696
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:01,424
   

697
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,384
Affirmative. Good image.

698
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:03,384
   

699
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,805
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

700
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:07,805
   

701
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,640
Affirmative.

702
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:09,640
   

703
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,856
Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.

704
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:16,856
   

705
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,415
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

706
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:34,415
   

707
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,126
Okay, guys.

708
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:37,126
   

709
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:41,756
Nice and easy.

710
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:41,756
   

711
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,674
Copy.

712
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:43,674
   

713
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,190
Icarus, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.

714
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,190
   

715
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,526
Yes, Cassie.

716
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:01,526
   

717
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,139
Establishing new alignment to sun.

718
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:32,139
   

719
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,394
Jesus.

720
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:36,394
   

721
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,688
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

722
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:38,688
   

723
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,399
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

724
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:41,399
   

725
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,235
I know what it is, flyboy.

726
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:44,235
   

727
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,413
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

728
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:55,413
   

729
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,438
Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.

730
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:20,438
   

731
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,941
Copy, Icarus. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.

732
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:23,941
   

733
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,278
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

734
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:27,278
   

735
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,041
You should see it up here, guys.

736
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,041
   

737
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,127
It's pretty impressive.

738
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:43,127
   

739
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,349
Okay.

740
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:56,349
   

741
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,477
There are four damaged panels.

742
00:32:59,477 --> 00:32:59,477
   

743
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,399
They're about 300 meters out.

744
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:05,399
   

745
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,415
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

746
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:21,415
   

747
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,294
Copy that, Cory.

748
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:25,294
   

749
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,635
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

750
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:32,635
   

751
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,804
Relaxed movement.

752
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:34,804
   

753
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,076
Approaching the first panel.

754
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:57,076
   

755
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,100
We were lucky.

756
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,100
   

757
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,561
Can you guys see this?

758
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:23,561
   

759
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,812
We can see it.

760
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:24,812
   

761
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,356
The hydraulics are burnt out.

762
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:27,356
   

763
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,817
Let's get this closed.

764
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:29,817
   

765
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,340
Okay, Mace.

766
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,340
   

767
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,842
That's it.

768
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:54,842
   

769
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,056
That's the first one closed.

770
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:01,056
   

771
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,850
You can do it?

772
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:02,850
   

773
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,310
It'll take a while, but...

774
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,310
   

775
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,229
Yeah.

776
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:07,229
   

777
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,064
We can do it.

778
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:09,064
   

779
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,860
Great job.

780
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:12,860
   

781
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,536
Lots of smiling faces
in this room.

782
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:22,536
   

783
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,663
-Great job.
-I love you, captain.

784
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:24,663
   

785
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,550
Moving to next panel.

786
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,550
   

787
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,719
Three to go.

788
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:38,719
   

789
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,741
Hey.

790
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:00,741
   

791
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,370
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

792
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:04,370
   

793
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,624
What's going on, guys?

794
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:08,624
   

795
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,292
The ship's moving.

796
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:10,292
   

797
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,211
We're venting O2. Shit.

798
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:12,211
   

799
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,796
I think we're venting O2.

800
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:13,796
   

801
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,840
Resuming computer control
of Icarus II.

802
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:15,840
   

803
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,633
Negative, Icarus. Manual control.

804
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:17,633
   

805
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,635
Negative, Cassie. Computer control.

806
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:19,635
   

807
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,304
-Returning vessel to original rotation.
-What?

808
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:22,304
   

809
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,598
Icarus, override computer
to manual control.

810
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:24,598
   

811
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,433
Negative. Mission in jeopardy.

812
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:26,433
   

813
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,562
Override command statement to
manual flight controls removed.

814
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:29,562
   

815
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,063
-Why?
-Negative, Icarus.

816
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,063
   

817
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,898
Negative. State reason immediately.

818
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:32,898
   

819
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,484
Fire in oxygen garden.

820
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:35,484
   

821
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,740
No.

822
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:41,740
   

823
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,619
Seal oxygen feed.

824
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:45,619
   

825
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,747
-Fireguard perimeter.
-Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

826
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:48,747
   

827
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,211
-Seal sections five through nine.
-Sealing five through nine.

828
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:54,211
   

829
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,425
Kaneda, Capa,
get back to the airlock now.

830
00:36:59,425 --> 00:36:59,425
   

831
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,968
Can't.

832
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:00,968
   

833
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,680
Can't leave upright panels.

834
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:04,680
   

835
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,100
The ship will burn up if the shields
are not repaired.

836
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,100
   

837
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,602
-They're gonna die.
-Don't.

838
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:09,602
   

839
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,478
-They're gonna burn.
-They are not.

840
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:11,478
   

841
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,230
Override Icarus. Cassie, pilot...

842
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,230
   

843
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,482
...emergency command 0-0-0.

-Copy.

848
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:20,237
   

849
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,324
Mace?

850
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:23,324
   

851
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,533
Wait, Cassie.

852
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:24,533
   

853
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,579
Jesus Christ, Harvey.

854
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:28,579
   

855
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,291
Harvey, comms officer,
confirm back-up 0-0-0.

856
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:32,291
   

857
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,918
Override command confirmed.

858
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:33,918
   

859
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,794
Manual control returned.

860
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:35,794
   

861
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,171
No.

862
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:37,171
   

863
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,131
Icarus, continue procedure.

864
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,131
   

865
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,008
What?

866
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,008
   

867
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,760
Captain.

868
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:42,760
   

869
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,930
-Back me up.
-Copy, Mace.

870
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:45,930
   

871
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,474
Crew priority
is to protect the payload.

872
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:48,474
   

873
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,517
Get the fire out.

874
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:50,517
   

875
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,062
Icarus, take control of the ship.

876
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:53,062
   

877
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,398
-Affirmative, captain.
-Damn it.

878
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:56,398
   

879
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,237
Returning vessel to original rotation.

880
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:02,237
   

881
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,463
-Let me in. Please.
-Negative.

882
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:19,463
   

883
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,049
Door sealed by operating superior
comms officer.

884
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,049
   

885
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,842
You motherfucker.

886
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:23,842
   

887
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,135
Let me in.

888
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:25,135
   

889
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,807
Hazard diagnostic complete.

890
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:29,807
   

891
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,725
Sprinkler system failing.

892
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:31,725
   

893
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,186
Fire will burn for six hours.

894
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:34,186
   

895
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,647
Sixty percent chance
of containment failure.

896
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:36,647
   

897
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,901
Seventy-five percent chance of collateral
damage to life-support systems.

898
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:40,901
   

899
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,070
What are we gonna do?

900
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,070
   

901
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,990
-Flood it with O2.
-What?

902
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:45,990
   

903
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,534
It'll cause a flashover.
Make it burn itself out.

904
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:48,534
   

905
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,285
We'll lose the whole garden.

906
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:50,285
   

907
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,495
We already lost it.

908
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:51,495
   

909
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,039
Jesus, Mace, I don't know.

910
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:54,039
   

911
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,417
Icarus, open the O2 tanks.

912
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:56,417
   

913
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,210
Cory, get the hell out of there.

914
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,210
   

915
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,004
Opening O2 tanks.

916
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,004
   

917
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,926
No.

918
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:05,926
   

919
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,904
Eighty-nine percent of shield
in full sunlight.

920
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:25,904
   

921
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,092
Capa, go back.

922
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:47,092
   

923
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,261
I'll finish this.

924
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:49,261
   

925
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,471
Please, I can do this.

926
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:50,471
   

927
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,767
Go.

928
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:54,767
   

929
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,277
Capa returning to airlock.

930
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:05,277
   

931
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,820
Do you copy?

932
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:06,820
   

933
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,117
Capa returning to airlock.
Do you copy?

934
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:12,117
   

935
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,037
Copy, Capa. Hurry.

936
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,037
   

937
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,958
Ninety-one percent of shield
in full sunlight.

938
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:19,958
   

939
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,070
Ninety-four percent of shield
in full sunlight.

940
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,070
   

941
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,621
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

942
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:57,621
   

943
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,706
Do you copy?

944
00:40:59,706 --> 00:40:59,706
   

945
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,626
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

946
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:02,626
   

947
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,088
Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.

948
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:06,088
   

949
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,341
Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.

950
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:09,341
   

951
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,843
You have to move now.

952
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:10,843
   

953
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,512
Captain, it's right on you.

954
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:13,512
   

955
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,223
-Kaneda's not gonna make it.
-You have to move.

956
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:16,223
   

957
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,350
You have to move now.

958
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:18,350
   

959
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,601
It's too far.

960
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:19,601
   

961
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,230
Captain, move.

962
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:23,230
   

963
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,358
Why isn't he moving?

964
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:26,358
   

965
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,485
Kaneda.

966
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:28,485
   

967
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,237
What do you see?

968
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:30,237
   

969
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,739
Searle, tell our captain to move.

970
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:32,739
   

971
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,993
Kaneda, what can you see?

972
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:35,993
   

973
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,953
Searle, do you copy?

974
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:37,953
   

975
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,262
Kaneda?

976
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:55,262
   

977
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,213
Shield rotation complete.

978
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,213
   

979
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,241
The breakdown is as follows.

980
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:57,241
   

981
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,243
Trey is sedated in the Med Centre.

982
00:42:59,243 --> 00:42:59,243
   

983
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,079
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

984
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,079
   

985
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,541
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

986
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:06,541
   

987
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,504
As second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.

988
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:10,504
   

989
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,006
Thanks both to Kaneda...

990
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:13,006
   

991
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,218
...and Capa, our shields are intact.

992
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:16,218
   

993
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,679
As is the payload.

994
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:18,679
   

995
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,599
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

996
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:22,599
   

997
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,937
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

998
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:26,937
   

999
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,689
As it stands now...

1000
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:28,689
   

1001
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:34,444
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

1002
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:34,444
   

1003
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,448
Let alone to survive
the return journey.

1004
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:38,448
   

1005
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,451
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

1006
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:41,451
   

1007
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,875
We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with Icarus I.

1008
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:48,875
   

1009
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,254
If we're gonna complete
the mission...

1010
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:52,254
   

1011
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:55,132
...the Icarus I is our only hope.

1012
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,132
   

1013
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,855
Technically, he made a mistake.

1014
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:09,855
   

1015
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,606
What are you trying to say, Cory?

1016
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:11,606
   

1017
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,444
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

1018
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:15,444
   

1019
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,654
But there is.

1020
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:17,654
   

1021
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:22,576
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

1022
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:22,576
   

1023
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,121
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

1024
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:26,121
   

1025
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,873
No.

1026
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:27,873
   

1027
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,084
And in any case...

1028
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:31,084
   

1029
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,087
...Trey wouldn't be enough.

1030
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:34,087
   

1031
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,466
We need to lose two more.

1032
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:37,466
   

1033
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,058
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

1034
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:46,058
   

1035
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,684
Capa, it's me.

1036
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:29,684
   

1037
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,858
It's different.

1038
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:36,858
   

1039
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:40,195
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

1040
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:40,195
   

1041
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,574
And then knowing that you won't.

1042
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:44,574
   

1043
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,246
Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from Icarus I.

1044
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:49,246
   

1045
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,956
No.

1046
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:50,956
   

1047
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,542
We're gonna die out here.

1048
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:53,542
   

1049
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,670
Like the other crew.

1050
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:56,670
   

1051
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,797
I know it.

1052
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:58,797
   

1053
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,509
So do you.

1054
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:02,509
   

1055
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,222
Are you scared?

1056
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:07,222
   

1057
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,358
When the stellar bomb is triggered...

1058
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:18,358
   

1059
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,154
...very little will happen at first.

1060
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:22,154
   

1061
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,532
And then a spark
will pop into existence...

1062
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:25,532
   

1063
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,536
...and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...

1064
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:29,536
   

1065
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,998
...it will split into two.

1066
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:32,998
   

1067
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,875
And those will split again...

1068
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:34,875
   

1069
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,918
...and again and again.

1070
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:36,918
   

1071
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,300
Detonation beyond all imagining.

1072
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,300
   

1073
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,928
A big bang on a small scale.

1074
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:46,928
   

1075
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,055
A new star born out of a dying one.

1076
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:49,055
   

1077
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,435
I think it'll be beautiful.

1078
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:53,435
   

1079
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,563
No. I'm not scared.

1080
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:56,563
   

1081
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,278
I am.

1082
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:03,278
   

1083
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,496
Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.

1084
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:54,496
   

1085
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,706
Okay, let's go.

1086
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:56,706
   

1087
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,857
Be careful, watch your step.

1088
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:45,857
   

1089
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,280
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

1090
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:52,280
   

1091
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,948
Getting what?

1092
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:53,948
   

1093
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,786
The air. It's full of dust.

1094
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:57,786
   

1095
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,621
Human skin.

1096
00:49:59,621 --> 00:49:59,621
   

1097
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:00,914
What?

1098
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:00,914
   

1099
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,334
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

1100
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:04,334
   

1101
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,965
Sorry.

1102
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:10,965
   

1103
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,013
-No lights?
-No.

1104
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:17,013
   

1105
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,431
No surprise.

1106
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:18,431
   

1107
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,394
Anyone afraid of the dark?

1108
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:22,394
   

1109
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,312
We should split up.

1110
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:24,312
   

1111
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,107
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

1112
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:27,107
   

1113
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,942
Yeah, probably right.

1114
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:28,942
   

1115
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,278
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

1116
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:32,278
   

1117
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,865
Icarus I is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.

1118
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:35,865
   

1119
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,451
Okay. You're right.

1120
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:38,451
   

1121
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,997
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

1122
00:50:42,997 --> 00:50:42,997
   

1123
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,669
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

1124
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:47,669
   

1125
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,713
Capa, aim for the payload.

1126
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:49,713
   

1127
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,466
I'll check the garden.

1128
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:53,466
   

1129
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,344
Let's keep in contact, guys.

1130
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:56,344
   

1131
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,509
Listen up, everybody.

1132
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:36,509
   

1133
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,722
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

1134
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:40,722
   

1135
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,309
Can you see this?

1136
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,309
   

1137
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,729
It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.

1138
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:47,729
   

1139
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,148
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

1140
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:50,148
   

1141
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,108
It's wonderful.

1142
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:52,108
   

1143
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,610
Oh, my God.

1144
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:53,610
   

1145
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,695
Cory, look at the ferns.

1146
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:55,695
   

1147
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,963
That's strange.

1148
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:13,963
   

1149
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,966
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

1150
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:16,966
   

1151
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,054
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

1152
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:21,054
   

1153
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,103
Got water.

1154
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:29,103
   

1155
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,567
Food.

1156
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:34,567
   

1157
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,450
No crew.

1158
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:42,450
   

1159
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,202
No bodies.

1160
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:44,202
   

1161
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,628
My God.

1162
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:53,628
   

1163
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,131
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

1164
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:57,131
   

1165
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,805
I am Pinbacker.

1166
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:03,805
   

1167
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,017
Commander of the Icarus l.

1168
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:08,017
   

1169
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,524
We have abandoned our mission.

1170
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:14,524
   

1171
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,486
Our star is dying.

1172
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:18,486
   

1173
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,532
All our science...

1174
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:22,532
   

1175
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,327
...all our hopes...

1176
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:26,327
   

1177
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:31,332
...our dreams, are foolish.

1178
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:31,332
   

1179
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,377
ln the face of this...

1180
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:34,377
   

1181
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,921
...we are...

1182
00:53:36,921 --> 00:53:36,921
   

1183
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:41,384
...dust. Nothing more.

1184
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:41,384
   

1185
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:46,764
And to this dust, we will return.

1186
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:46,764
   

1187
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:55,899
When he chooses for us to die...

1188
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:55,899
   

1189
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,318
...it is not our place...

1190
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:58,318
   

1191
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,071
...to challenge God.

1192
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:02,071
   

1193
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,952
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

1194
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:07,952
   

1195
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,581
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

1196
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:11,581
   

1197
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,044
That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.

1198
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:16,044
   

1199
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,214
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

1200
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:20,214
   

1201
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,609
Payload is fully operational.

1202
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:39,609
   

1203
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:40,985
Say again, Capa?

1204
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:40,985
   

1205
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,863
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

1206
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:43,863
   

1207
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,826
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

1208
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:48,826
   

1209
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,620
No, we don't.

1210
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:50,620
   

1211
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,372
Go ahead, Mace?

1212
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:52,372
   

1213
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,999
I know what caused
the distress signal.

1214
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:54,999
   

1215
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,711
There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...

1216
00:54:58,711 --> 00:54:58,711
   

1217
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,756
...it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.

1218
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:01,756
   

1219
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,384
Without the mainframe, we can't fly.

1220
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:04,384
   

1221
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,971
It's been sabotaged.

1222
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:07,971
   

1223
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,601
We should never have
gone off the mission.

1224
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:13,601
   

1225
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,830
I have something to say.

1226
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:33,830
   

1227
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,708
Found the crew.

1228
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:36,708
   

1229
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,023
What happened?

1230
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:00,023
   

1231
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,484
They had an epiphany.

1232
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:03,484
   

1233
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,570
They saw the light.

1234
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:05,570
   

1235
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,656
They burned themselves.

1236
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:08,656
   

1237
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,158
No shit.

1238
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:10,158
   

1239
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,703
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

1240
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:13,703
   

1241
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:19,167
If we weren't behind the screen
of Icarus II, we'd join them.

1242
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:19,167
   

1243
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,127
Ashes to ashes.

1244
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:21,127
   

1245
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,506
Stardust to stardust.

1246
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:25,506
   

1247
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,508
Icarus!

1248
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:27,508
   

1249
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,390
Icarus. Stabilizers.

1250
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,390
   

1251
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,691
-What was that?
-Guys, get back to the airlock now.

1252
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:43,691
   

1253
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,740
We have a major incident.

1254
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:50,740
   

1255
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,700
We are floating free from you.

1256
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:52,700
   

1257
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,619
Repeat, we are floating free.

1258
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:54,619
   

1259
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,704
All crew back to the airlock.

1260
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:56,704
   

1261
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,843
-Cassie.
-The airlock has decoupled.

1262
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:10,843
   

1263
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,553
We don't know why.

1264
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:12,553
   

1265
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,389
The locking system on Icarus I
is totally ripped open.

1266
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:15,389
   

1267
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,768
I can hold our position but we aren't
gonna be able to dock again.

1268
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:18,768
   

1269
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,269
There's another thing, guys.

1270
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:20,269
   

1271
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,314
You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.

1272
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:23,314
   

1273
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,108
We're screwed.

1274
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:25,108
   

1275
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,151
No, we're not.

1276
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:27,151
   

1277
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,201
One of us isn't, anyway.

1278
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:35,201
   

1279
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,470
What happened?

1280
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,470
   

1281
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,640
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

1282
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:57,640
   

1283
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,609
-Why Capa?
-The rest of us are lower priority.

1284
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:08,609
   

1285
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,194
I'm not a low priority.

1286
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:10,194
   

1287
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,197
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

1288
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:13,197
   

1289
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,532
I am the captain.

1290
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:14,532
   

1291
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,743
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

1292
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:17,743
   

1293
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,874
Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of Icarus who can operate the payload.

1294
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:22,874
   

1295
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,458
There is no choice.

1296
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:24,458
   

1297
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,169
No, there's no choice for you.

1298
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:26,169
   

1299
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,172
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

1300
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:29,172
   

1301
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,385
Get out of the suit.

1302
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:34,385
   

1303
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,725
That is a direct order.

1304
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:40,725
   

1305
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:48,191
I assure you, when I'm onboard Icarus II
that I'll do everything within my power...

1306
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,191
   

1307
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,943
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

1308
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:50,943
   

1309
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,653
The airlock is ripped in half.

1310
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:52,653
   

1311
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,532
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

1312
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:56,532
   

1313
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,665
Cassie.

1314
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:04,665
   

1315
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,834
Go.

1316
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:06,834
   

1317
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:10,004
Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.

1318
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:10,004
   

1319
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,049
So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?

1320
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:13,049
   

1321
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:14,634
Right.

1322
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:14,634
   

1323
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,137
If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.

1324
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:18,137
   

1325
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,098
And so will we.

1326
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:21,098
   

1327
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,478
Without suits?

1328
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:25,478
   

1329
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,774
-Get as close as you can.
-You'll have 20 meters to cover.

1330
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:29,774
   

1331
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:32,568
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

1332
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:32,568
   

1333
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,530
It's gonna be cold.

1334
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:36,530
   

1335
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,866
But we'll make it.

1336
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:38,866
   

1337
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,079
Anyone got any better ideas?

1338
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,079
   

1339
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,627
Copy that.

1340
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:49,627
   

1341
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,812
Mace.

1342
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:07,812
   

1343
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,231
One problem.

1344
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:10,231
   

1345
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,733
The computer's down.

1346
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:12,733
   

1347
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,487
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

1348
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:16,487
   

1349
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,656
From inside.

1350
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:18,656
   

1351
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,826
Shit.

1352
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:21,826
   

1353
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,830
You're right.

1354
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:25,830
   

1355
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:30,042
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

1356
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:30,042
   

1357
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,172
I see. I get it.

1358
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:35,172
   

1359
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,676
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

1360
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:38,676
   

1361
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,847
No, Harvey.

1362
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:42,847
   

1363
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:44,056
It's me.

1364
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:44,056
   

1365
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,495
You okay?

1366
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:06,495
   

1367
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,582
Hey, Capa.

1368
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:09,582
   

1369
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,584
We're only stardust.

1370
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:11,584
   

1371
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,724
Mace, we're lined up.

1372
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:26,724
   

1373
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,018
Everything's set.

1374
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:29,018
   

1375
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,608
Searle, are you ready?

1376
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:35,608
   

1377
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,655
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

1378
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:41,655
   

1379
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,865
Cassie.

1380
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:42,865
   

1381
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,284
-Are you ready?
-Ready.

1382
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:45,284
   

1383
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:49,163
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

1384
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:49,163
   

1385
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,456
Copy.

1386
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:50,456
   

1387
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,087
Let's do it.

1388
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:56,087
   

1389
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,552
Crew detected in airlock.

1390
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:44,552
   

1391
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,263
Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.

1392
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:47,263
   

1393
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,015
I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.

1394
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:50,015
   

1395
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,685
-Harvey's gone.
-Crew detected in airlock.

1396
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:52,685
   

1397
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,604
Sealing outer airlock door.

1398
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:55,604
   

1399
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,184
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

1400
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:33,184
   

1401
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,518
Get my hand. Get my hand.

1402
01:03:34,518 --> 01:03:34,518
   

1403
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,103
-Breathe, Mace.
-Capa?

1404
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:36,103
   

1405
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:39,106
You're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

1406
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:39,106
   

1407
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,836
-Capa, are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1408
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:00,836
   

1409
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,298
Let's get you out of here.

1410
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:04,298
   

1411
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:48,384
Searle?

1412
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:48,384
   

1413
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,011
We're leaving now.

1414
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:51,011
   

1415
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,560
We're gonna complete the mission.

1416
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:57,560
   

1417
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,564
We're all thinking of you, Searle.

1418
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:01,564
   

1419
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,983
Searle?

1420
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:03,983
   

1421
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,944
We're gonna go now.

1422
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:06,944
   

1423
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,826
We love you.

1424
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:13,826
   

1425
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,648
I've been through Icarus's activity file
and I checked it.

1426
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:44,648
   

1427
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,984
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

1428
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:46,984
   

1429
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,528
And it's the same results.

1430
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:49,528
   

1431
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,283
In other words, unless Icarus is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.

1432
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:54,283
   

1433
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:57,578
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

1434
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:57,578
   

1435
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:01,206
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

1436
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:01,206
   

1437
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,501
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

1438
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:04,501
   

1439
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,670
And I was with Capa and Searle.

1440
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:06,670
   

1441
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,674
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

1442
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:10,674
   

1443
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,469
Which leaves one possibility.

1444
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:13,469
   

1445
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,096
Trey.

1446
01:06:16,096 --> 01:06:16,096
   

1447
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,932
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

1448
01:06:18,932 --> 01:06:18,932
   

1449
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,728
He sleeps for 23 hours a day.
And he blames himself for everything.

1450
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:22,728
   

1451
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,563
-Why would he do it?
-We don't know.

1452
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:24,563
   

1453
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,484
The possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

1454
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:28,484
   

1455
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,985
By doping him up more?

1456
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:29,985
   

1457
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:35,240
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock.

1458
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:35,240
   

1459
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,660
There is something else too.

1460
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:37,660
   

1461
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:45,376
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

1462
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:45,376
   

1463
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,128
If Trey dies...

1464
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:48,128
   

1465
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,591
...we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

1466
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:52,591
   

1467
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:54,968
At least now we know what happened
on Icarus l.

1468
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:54,968
   

1469
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,430
-The same thing that's happening here.
-Fuck you, Capa.

1470
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:58,430
   

1471
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,767
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

1472
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:01,767
   

1473
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,190
I'll do it.

1474
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:08,190
   

1475
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,944
I'm not passing any bucks.

1476
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:11,944
   

1477
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,446
Do it how?

1478
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:14,446
   

1479
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,158
That's between me and Trey.

1480
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:18,158
   

1481
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,831
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

1482
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:23,831
   

1483
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,501
So you know where I stand.

1484
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:27,501
   

1485
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:35,759
And me.

1486
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:35,759
   

1487
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,098
What are you asking?

1488
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:41,098
   

1489
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,935
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

1490
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:44,935
   

1491
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,983
Kill him.

1492
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:50,983
   

1493
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,277
Cassie?

1494
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:53,277
   

1495
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,782
No.

1496
01:07:58,782 --> 01:07:58,782
   

1497
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:05,414
-Cassie.
-I know the argument.

1498
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:05,414
   

1499
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,666
I know the logic.

1500
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:07,666
   

1501
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,586
You're saying you need my vote.

1502
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:10,586
   

1503
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,255
I'm saying you can't have it.

1504
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:13,255
   

1505
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,724
What do we do?

1506
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:23,724
   

1507
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,149
Oh, God.

1508
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,149
   

1509
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,694
I'm sorry, Cassie.

1510
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:35,694
   

1511
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,036
You make it easy for him.

1512
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:44,036
   

1513
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,206
Somehow.

1514
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:47,206
   

1515
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,083
Find a kindness.

1516
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:50,083
   

1517
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:55,941
Trey.

1518
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:55,941
   

1519
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,322
Everybody get here now.

1520
01:10:02,322 --> 01:10:02,322
   

1521
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,673
He cut his wrists.

1522
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:19,673
   

1523
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,050
He took responsibility.

1524
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:22,050
   

1525
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,514
All these deaths.

1526
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:27,514
   

1527
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,141
Kaneda.

1528
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:29,141
   

1529
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,768
Searle. Harvey.

1530
01:10:31,768 --> 01:10:31,768
   

1531
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,395
Trey.

1532
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:33,395
   

1533
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,691
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

1534
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:37,691
   

1535
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,321
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't want you to say shit.

1536
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:42,321
   

1537
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,657
I just want you to know that this...

1538
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:45,657
   

1539
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,826
...belongs here.

1540
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:47,826
   

1541
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,955
Fuck you.

1542
01:10:51,955 --> 01:10:51,955
   

1543
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,395
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

1544
01:11:15,395 --> 01:11:15,395
   

1545
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,348
-Icarus?
-Yes, Capa?

1546
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:51,348
   

1547
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,142
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

1548
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:54,142
   

1549
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,812
Check oxygen consumption.

1550
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:56,812
   

1551
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,106
Checking.

1552
01:11:59,106 --> 01:11:59,106
   

1553
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,400
Thank you.

1554
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:01,400
   

1555
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,528
Capa.

1556
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:04,528
   

1557
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:06,488
-Yes?
-You are dying.

1558
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:06,488
   

1559
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,740
All crew are dying.

1560
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:08,740
   

1561
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,742
We know we're dying.

1562
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:10,742
   

1563
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,663
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

1564
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:14,663
   

1565
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,039
...we're okay with it.

1566
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:16,039
   

1567
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,792
Capa, warning.

1568
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:18,792
   

1569
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,920
You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.

1570
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:21,920
   

1571
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,758
Please clarify.

1572
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:26,758
   

1573
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:30,679
Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.

1574
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:30,679
   

1575
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,516
Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.

1576
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:34,516
   

1577
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,476
Sixteen hours until death.

1578
01:12:36,476 --> 01:12:36,476
   

1579
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,145
Journey time to delivery point:

1580
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:38,145
   

1581
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,731
-Nineteen hours.
-Impossible. Corazon was certain.

1582
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:40,731
   

1583
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,233
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

1584
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:43,233
   

1585
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,319
Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves...

1586
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:46,319
   

1587
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,864
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

1588
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:48,864
   

1589
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,073
Negative.

1590
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:50,073
   

1591
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:53,160
Affirmative, Icarus. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.

1592
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,160
   

1593
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,370
Five crew members.

1594
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:55,370
   

1595
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,377
Icarus?

1596
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:02,377
   

1597
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,129
Yes?

1598
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:04,129
   

1599
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,966
Who's the fifth crew member?

1600
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:07,966
   

1601
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,969
Unknown.

1602
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:10,969
   

1603
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,640
Where is the fifth crew member?

1604
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:15,640
   

1605
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,602
ln the Observation Room.

1606
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:18,602
   

1607
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,810
Are you an angel?

1608
01:13:59,810 --> 01:13:59,810
   

1609
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,356
Has the time come?

1610
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:04,356
   

1611
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,821
I've been waiting so long.

1612
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:10,821
   

1613
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,496
Who are you?

1614
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:19,496
   

1615
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:22,833
Who am l?

1616
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:22,833
   

1617
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,716
At the end of time...

1618
01:14:31,716 --> 01:14:31,716
   

1619
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,513
...a moment will come
when just one man remains.

1620
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:36,513
   

1621
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,058
Then the moment will pass.

1622
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:40,058
   

1623
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,896
The man will be gone.

1624
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:44,896
   

1625
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:51,570
There will be nothing to show
that we were ever here...

1626
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:51,570
   

1627
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:54,948
...but stardust.

1628
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:54,948
   

1629
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:01,663
The last man, alone with God.

1630
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:01,663
   

1631
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,127
Am I that man?

1632
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:07,127
   

1633
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,018
My God.

1634
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:23,018
   

1635
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,065
My God, Pinbacker?

1636
01:15:29,065 --> 01:15:29,065
   

1637
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,194
Not your God.

1638
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:32,194
   

1639
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,029
Mine.

1640
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:34,029
   

1641
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,544
Icarus. Full sunlight.

1642
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:49,544
   

1643
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:07,812
Anyone.

1644
01:16:07,812 --> 01:16:07,812
   

1645
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,036
Oh, my God.

1646
01:17:05,036 --> 01:17:05,036
   

1647
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,496
Icarus?

1648
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:06,496
   

1649
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,214
Warning, you do not have
authority to remove...

1650
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:16,214
   

1651
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,675
...the mainframe panels
from the coolant.

1652
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:18,675
   

1653
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,594
Please return the panels
to the coolant.

1654
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:21,594
   

1655
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:25,515
I cannot locate
your biometric signs.

1656
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:25,515
   

1657
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,977
Please identify yourself.

1658
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:28,977
   

1659
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,377
You gotta be kidding.

1660
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:54,377
   

1661
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,313
My God.

1662
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:13,313
   

1663
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,573
A baby.

1664
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:23,573
   

1665
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,160
A beautiful baby.

1666
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:27,160
   

1667
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,829
Icarus, patch me through to Mace.
I have something...

1668
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:29,829
   

1669
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,539
...wonderful to show him.

1670
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:31,539
   

1671
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,209
Or Cassie or Capa.

1672
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:34,209
   

1673
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,669
Icarus?

1674
01:18:36,669 --> 01:18:36,669
   

1675
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:46,679
Don't fight.

1676
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:46,679
   

1677
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,630
Mace?

1678
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,630
   

1679
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,250
Capa?

1680
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:57,250
   

1681
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,296
Is anyone else getting silence
from Icarus?

1682
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:01,296
   

1683
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,758
Anybody?

1684
01:20:05,758 --> 01:20:05,758
   

1685
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,650
Capa?

1686
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:22,650
   

1687
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,724
Icarus, why are we in orbit?

1688
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:54,724
   

1689
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,603
Respond.

1690
01:20:58,603 --> 01:20:58,603
   

1691
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:02,982
What?

1692
01:21:02,982 --> 01:21:02,982
   

1693
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,317
Jesus Christ.

1694
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:04,317
   

1695
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,736
Capa? Capa?

1696
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:06,736
   

1697
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,699
In the suit.

1698
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:11,699
   

1699
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,326
Use the hard link.

1700
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:13,326
   

1701
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,619
In the helmet.

1702
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:14,619
   

1703
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,371
Mace?

1704
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:16,371
   

1705
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,876
-What the hell is going on?
-Mace?

1706
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:21,876
   

1707
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,753
I can't talk to Icarus.

1708
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:23,753
   

1709
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:27,257
Pinbacker is onboard.
He's trying to stop the mission.

1710
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:27,257
   

1711
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,260
He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.

1712
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:30,260
   

1713
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,440
Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.

1714
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:44,440
   

1715
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,527
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

1716
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:47,527
   

1717
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,826
The mechanism is disabled.

1718
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:54,826
   

1719
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,744
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

1720
01:21:56,744 --> 01:21:56,744
   

1721
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,788
Mace, repeat, please.

1722
01:21:58,788 --> 01:21:58,788
   

1723
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,333
Icarus is gonna burn out.

1724
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:02,333
   

1725
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,379
Mace.

1726
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:06,379
   

1727
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,298
Mace, come in.

1728
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:08,298
   

1729
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,946
Come on.

1730
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:36,946
   

1731
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,286
Capa.

1732
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:43,286
   

1733
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:44,495
-Capa.
-Mace?

1734
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:44,495
   

1735
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:47,707
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

1736
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:47,707
   

1737
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,753
I don't know if I can get her
back online.

1738
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:51,753
   

1739
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,715
You have to break us out
of orbit manually.

1740
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:55,715
   

1741
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,467
The only way to do that...

1742
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:57,467
   

1743
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,595
...is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

1744
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:00,595
   

1745
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,556
Force the bomb into the sun.

1746
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:03,556
   

1747
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,808
Separate the payload.

1748
01:25:05,808 --> 01:25:05,808
   

1749
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:10,855
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

1750
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:10,855
   

1751
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,524
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

1752
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:13,524
   

1753
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:17,779
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

1754
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:17,779
   

1755
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,615
Okay.

1756
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:20,615
   

1757
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:23,326
I'm gonna do this.

1758
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:23,326
   

1759
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:25,787
Copy, Mace.

1760
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:25,787
   

1761
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,956
Copy.

1762
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:28,956
   

1763
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,181
Capa.

1764
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:27,181
   

1765
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,392
My leg.

1766
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:29,392
   

1767
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,241
Oh, God.

1768
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:45,241
   

1769
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,876
Do it, Capa.

1770
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:54,876
   

1771
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,591
Do it.

1772
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:01,591
   

1773
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:08,848
Mace.

1774
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:08,848
   

1775
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,381
Come on.

1776
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:52,381
   

1777
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,107
Only dream I ever have.

1778
01:32:52,107 --> 01:32:52,107
   

1779
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,859
ls it the surface of the sun?

1780
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:53,859
   

1781
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:58,614
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

1782
01:32:58,614 --> 01:32:58,614
   

1783
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,295
Cassie?

1784
01:35:02,295 --> 01:35:02,295
   

1785
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:13,874
We're flying into the sun.

1786
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:13,874
   

1787
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,880
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

1788
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:19,880
   

1789
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:21,507
Where is he? Is he here?

1790
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:21,507
   

1791
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:31,850
For seven years I spoke with God.

1792
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:31,850
   

1793
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:42,820
He told me to take us all to heaven.

1794
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:42,820
   

1795
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,078
No.

1796
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:51,078
   

1797
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,331
Finish it.

1798
01:36:36,331 --> 01:36:36,331
   

1799
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,620
Let's say 25. Set at 25.

1800
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:56,620
   

1801
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,927
Please.

1802
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:11,927
   

1803
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:05,666
Hi, sis.

1804
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:05,666
   

1805
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:08,710
Kiss the kids.

1806
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:08,710
   

1807
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:18,720
You guys, come on.

1808
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:18,720
   

1809
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,223
It's time.

1810
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:21,223
   

1811
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,522
So if you wake up one morning...

1812
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:28,522
   

1813
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:33,110
...and it's a particularly beautiful day,
you'll know we made it.

1814
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:33,110
   

1815
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,239
Okay.

1816
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:37,239
   

1817
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,408
I'm signing out.

1818
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:39,408
   

1819
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,688
[English - US]
1820
01:47:25,688 --> 01:47:25,688
