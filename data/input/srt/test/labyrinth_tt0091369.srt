1
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:18,681
<i>It's only forever</i>

2
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,681
<i>Not long at all</i>

3
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,351
<i>The lost and the lonely</i>

4
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,751
<i>No one can blame you</i>

5
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,031
<i>For walking away</i>

6
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,871
<i>But too much rejection</i>

7
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,371
<i>No love injection</i>

8
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:49,041
<i>Life can be easy</i>

9
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,651
<i>It's not always swell</i>

10
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:59,221
<i>Don't tell me truth hurts
little girl</i>

11
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,551
<i>'Cause it hurts like hell</i>

12
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,561
<i>But down in the underground</i>

13
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,731
<i>You'll find someone true</i>

14
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,241
<i>Down in the underground</i>

15
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:19,141
<i>A land serene</i>

16
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:22,241
<i>A crystal moon</i>

17
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:28,781
<i>It's only forever</i>

18
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:32,911
<i>It's not long at all</i>

19
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,731
<i>The lost and the lonely</i>

20
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,021
<i>That's underground</i>

21
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:45,431
<i>Underground</i>

22
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,281
Give me the child.

23
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,851
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

24
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,521
I have fought my way to the castle
beyond the Goblin City...

25
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,621
to take back the child
that you have stolen.

26
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:17,861
For my will
is as strong as yours...

27
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:21,461
and my kingdom is as great--

28
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:31,341
For my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great--

29
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,711
Damn.

30
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:36,311
Oh, I can never remember that line.

31
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,051
"You have no power over me."

32
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,461
Oh, Merlin.

33
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,731
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

34
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,101
Come on. Come on!

35
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,851
<i>No one can blame you</i>

36
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:16,351
<i>For walking away</i>

37
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,461
<i>But too much rejection</i>

38
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:26,401
<i>No love injection</i>

39
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,461
<i>Life can be easy</i>

40
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:33,771
<i>It's not always swell</i>

41
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:39,751
<i>Don't tell me truth hurts
little girl</i>

42
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,441
<i>'Cause it hurts like hell</i>

43
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:47,551
Oh, it's not fair!

44
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,981
Oh, really.

45
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:53,591
- I'm sorry.
- Don't stand in the rain. Come on.

46
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,761
All right. Come on, Merlin.

47
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:57,801
- Come on.
- Not the dog.

48
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,101
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.

49
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,271
Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.

50
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,781
Go.

51
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,681
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I was sorry!

52
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,721
Please let me finish.

53
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,781
- Your father and I go out rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.

54
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,851
I ask you to baby-sit only if it
won't interfere with your plans.

55
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:25,661
You don't know what my plans are.
You don't even ask me anymore.

56
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,961
I assume you'd tell me you had a date.
I'd like it if you had a date.

57
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:33,091
- You should have dates at your age.
- Sarah, you're home.

58
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:36,771
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?

59
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:41,541
She treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a fairy story no matter what I say.

60
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,101
I'll talk to her.

61
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,531
Through dangers untold...

62
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:07,961
and hardships unnumbered...

63
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,701
I have fought my way here
to the castle...

64
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:13,801
beyond the Goblin City...

65
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:18,651
to take back the child...

66
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,481
that you have stolen.

67
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:28,021
- Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!

68
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,721
Hurry. You're gonna be late.

69
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,231
Listen, we fed Toby
and put him to bed.

70
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,391
We do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.

71
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,831
You really wanted
to talk to me, didn't you?

72
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,671
Practically broke down the door.

73
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:46,671
Lancelot!

74
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,911
Someone has been in my room again.

75
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:52,921
I hate that. I hate it!

76
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,921
I hate you. I hate you!

77
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,561
Someone save me, take me away
from this awful place!

78
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:11,801
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?

79
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,301
Okay.

80
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,011
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful, young girl...

81
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,241
whose stepmother always
made her stay home with the baby.

82
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,711
The baby was a spoiled child
and wanted everything for himself...

83
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,721
and the young girl
was practically a slave.

84
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,821
But what no one knew...

85
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:35,021
was that the king of the goblins
had fallen in love with the girl...

86
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,621
and he had given her
certain powers.

87
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,181
So one night...

88
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:42,721
when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her...

89
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:45,431
she called on the goblins for help.

90
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,501
Listen.

91
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,911
"Say your right words,"
the goblins said.

92
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:58,741
"And we'll take the baby
to the Goblin City...

93
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,511
and you will be free."

94
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,751
But the girl knew
that the king of the goblins...

95
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,421
would keep the baby in his castle
forever and ever and ever...

96
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,021
and turn it into a goblin.

97
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,061
So the girl suffered in silence...

98
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:19,121
until one night, when she was tired
from a day of housework...

99
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:22,971
and she was hurt by the harsh words
of her stepmother...

100
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,271
and she could no longer stand it--

101
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,911
Oh, all right!

102
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,241
Knock it off. Come on.

103
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,511
Stop it!

104
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,521
I'll say the words.

105
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,751
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

106
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,131
I wish--

107
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,251
I wish.

108
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,591
- She's going to say it.
- Say what?

109
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,961
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

110
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,971
You shut up.

111
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,841
Listen.
She's going to say the words.

112
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,401
I can bear it no longer!

113
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:03,381
Goblin King, Goblin King,
wherever you may be...

114
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:06,971
take this child of mine
far away from me!

115
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:11,711
- No!
- That's not it.

116
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,321
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with "I wish."

117
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,151
Toby, stop it!

118
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:25,201
I wish I did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.

119
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,071
"I wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."

120
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,071
That's not hard, is it?

121
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,271
I wish--

122
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,941
I wish--

123
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:38,911
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!

124
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:59,861
I wish the goblins would
come and take you away.

125
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,401
Right now.

126
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:24,891
Toby?

127
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,421
Toby, are you all right?

128
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,311
Why aren't you crying?

129
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:10,031
You're him, aren't you?
You're the goblin king.

130
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:13,001
I want my brother back, please,
if it's all the same.

131
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:15,401
What's said is said.

132
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,461
But I didn't mean it.

133
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,631
- Oh, you didn't.
- Please.

134
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,041
Where is he?

135
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,741
You know very well where he is.

136
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,751
Please bring him back. Please.

137
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,911
Sarah...

138
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,111
go back to your room...

139
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:35,781
play with your toys
and your costumes.

140
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,791
Forget about the baby.

141
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,431
I can't.

142
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,121
I've brought you a gift.

143
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,231
- What is it?
- It's a crystal.

144
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,501
Nothing more.

145
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,841
But if you turn it this way...

146
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,531
look into it.

147
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,981
It will show you your dreams.

148
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,141
But this is not a gift
for an ordinary girl...

149
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,151
who takes care
of a screaming baby.

150
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,351
Do you want it?

151
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:09,521
Then forget the baby.

152
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,291
I can't.

153
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:17,421
I appreciate what you're trying to do
for me, but I want my brother back.

154
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,431
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.

155
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,181
Don't defy me.

156
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,051
You're no match for me.

157
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,221
But I have to
have my brother back.

158
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,431
He's there, in my castle.

159
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,101
Do you still
want to look for him?

160
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,101
Is that the castle
beyond the Goblin City?

161
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,311
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.

162
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,251
I can't.

163
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,341
Don't you understand
that I can't?

164
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,011
What a pity.

165
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,291
It doesn't look that far.

166
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,591
It's further than you think.
Time is short.

167
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,571
You have 13 hours in which
to solve the labyrinth...

168
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,801
before your baby brother...

169
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,931
becomes one of us...

170
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,441
forever.

171
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,481
<i>Such a pity</i>.

172
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,041
The labyrinth.

173
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,411
It doesn't look that hard.

174
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,381
Well, come on, feet.

175
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:13,781
- Excuse me?
- Oh, excuse me!

176
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,221
Oh, it's you.

177
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,521
Excuse me, but I have to get through
this labyrinth. Can you help me?

178
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:27,231
Oh, how sweet.

179
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,271
Fifty-seven!

180
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:32,891
- How could you?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:35,101
Poor thing.

182
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,771
You monster. Ow!

183
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:41,741
It bit me!

184
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:44,081
What did you expect
fairies to do?

185
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,281
I thought they did nice things
like granting wishes.

186
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,821
Huh? Shows what you know,
don't it?

187
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,991
- Fifty-eight.
- You're horrible.

188
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,891
Huh? No, I ain't.

189
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,121
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

190
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:00,991
That's what I thought.

191
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,561
Fifty-nine.

192
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,861
Do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?

193
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:09,371
- Maybe.
- Where is it?

194
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,931
Oh, you little--

195
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,741
Sixty!

196
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:15,111
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?

197
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,341
- The door.
- What door?

198
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,941
It's hopeless asking you anything.

199
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,711
Not if you ask the right questions.

200
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,621
How do I get into the labyrinth?

201
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:31,851
Now that's more like it.

202
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,801
You gets in there.

203
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,771
You really going in there,
are you?

204
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,841
Yes.

205
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,441
I'm afraid I have to.

206
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,031
Cozy, isn't it?

207
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:27,721
Now, would you go left
or right?

208
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:34,381
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.

209
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,321
- Which way would you go?
- Me?

210
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,881
I wouldn't go either way.

211
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:41,731
If that's all the help you're
gonna be, you can just leave.

212
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:45,961
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.

213
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:48,391
Take this labyrinth--

214
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:51,701
Even if you get to the center,
you'll never get out again.

215
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,801
- That's your opinion.
- It's a lot better than yours.

216
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,241
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.

217
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:04,481
It's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.

218
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,981
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't any turns or corners.

219
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,421
It just goes on and on.

220
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,161
Maybe it doesn't.

221
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:28,101
Maybe I'm just taking it
for granted that it does.

222
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,651
'Allo.

223
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,961
Did you say "hello"?

224
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,731
No, I said "'allo,"
but that's close enough.

225
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:36,361
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- That's right.

226
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:39,471
You don't by any chance
know the way through this labyrinth?

227
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,031
Who, me?
No, I'm just a worm.

228
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,711
Come inside, meet the missus.

229
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:49,981
No, thank you, but I have
to solve this labyrinth.

230
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,681
But there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.

231
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,851
It just goes on and on.

232
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,831
You ain't looking right. It's full
of openings, but you ain't seeing 'em.

233
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,261
- Where are they?
- There's one just across there.

234
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,701
It's right in front of ya.

235
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:05,891
No, there isn't.

236
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,771
Come inside and have
a nice cup of tea.

237
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:12,831
- But there isn't an opening.
- Of course there is.

238
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:16,471
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.

239
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:17,641
What?

240
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,201
Go on then.

241
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:24,321
That's just wall.
There's no way through.

242
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:26,681
Things are not always
what they seem in this place.

243
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:30,211
So you can't take anything
for granted.

244
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,771
Hey!

245
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,231
- Hang on.
- Thank you.

246
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,431
- That was incredibly helpful.
- Don't go that way.

247
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:48,311
- What was that?
- I said, don't go that way.

248
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:51,041
Never go that way.

249
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,981
Oh. Thanks.

250
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:57,251
If she had kept on
going down that way...

251
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:00,151
she'd had gone straight
to that castle.

252
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,901
Toby.

253
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,901
I'm coming, Toby.

254
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:30,281
Give me back this!
Go on, get off me.

255
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:33,521
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?

256
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,521
Walk, walk, walk.

257
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:01,321
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

258
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,941
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

259
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:04,611
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?

260
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:05,751
- You do.
- Do what?

261
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:08,591
Remind me of the babe.

262
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:11,291
Quiet! A goblin babe.

263
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:16,561
Well?

264
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,271
<i>I saw my baby</i>

265
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:27,301
<i>Crying hard as babe could cry</i>

266
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:29,781
<i>What could I do</i>

267
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:32,581
<i>My baby's love had gone</i>

268
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:36,581
<i>And left my baby blue</i>

269
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,421
<i>Nobody knew</i>

270
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:44,321
<i>What kind of magic spell to use</i>

271
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:46,421
<i>Slime and snails</i>

272
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:48,791
<i>Or a puppy dog's tail</i>

273
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,631
<i>Thunder or lightning</i>

274
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,101
<i>And baby said</i>

275
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,941
<i>- Dance, magic
- Dance, magic, dance</i>

276
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:58,031
<i>- Dance, magic, dance
- Dance, magic, dance</i>

277
00:23:58,111 --> 00:24:00,541
<i>Put that baby spell on me</i>

278
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:04,781
<i>- Jump, magic, jump
- Jump, magic, jump</i>

279
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,181
<i>Put that magic jump on me</i>

280
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:11,621
<i>Slap that baby
Make him free</i>

281
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,771
Hey, what goes on?

282
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:38,141
Your mother is an aardvark!

283
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:59,071
In 9 hours and 23 minutes...

284
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,071
you'll be mine.

285
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,781
<i>I saw my baby</i>

286
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:14,411
<i>Trying hard as babe could try</i>

287
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,421
<i>What could I do</i>

288
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,181
<i>My baby's fun had gone</i>

289
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:23,051
<i>And left my baby blue</i>

290
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:26,251
<i>Nobody knew</i>

291
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:30,991
<i>What kind of magic spells to use</i>

292
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,061
<i>Slime and snails</i>

293
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,371
<i>Puppy dog's tails</i>

294
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,371
<i>Thunder or lightning</i>

295
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,671
<i>Then baby said</i>

296
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:42,311
<i>- Dance, magic, dance</i>
- <i>Dance, magic, dance</i>

297
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,081
<i>Put that baby spell on me</i>

298
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,911
<i>- Jump, magic, jump
- Jump, magic, jump</i>

299
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:55,751
<i>Put that magic jump on me</i>

300
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,051
<i>Slap that baby
Make him free</i>

301
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:00,491
<i>- Dance, magic dance
- Dance, magic, dance</i>

302
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:09,831
<i>Jump, magic, jump</i>

303
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,271
<i>Put that baby spell on me</i>

304
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,061
- You got it?
- I got it.

305
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,601
- Good.
- Shh!

306
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:51,311
Someone has been
changing my marks.

307
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:54,581
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!

308
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,211
That's right. It's not fair.

309
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,421
But that's only half of it.

310
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:06,061
- This was a dead end a minute ago.
- No, that's the dead end behind you.

311
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,831
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?

312
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,891
The only way out of here
is to try one of these doors.

313
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,871
One of them leads to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

314
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:22,311
- And the other one leads to...
- Boom-boom-ba-boom.

315
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,311
certain death.

316
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,981
Which one is which?

317
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:32,081
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?

318
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,821
- We don't know.
- But they do.

319
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,861
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

320
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:43,931
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.

321
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,901
It's in the rules,
and I should warn you...

322
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:48,701
one of us always tells the truth...

323
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,931
and one of us always lies.

324
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,471
That's a rule too.
He always lies.

325
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:57,031
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- Oh, what a lie.

326
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,581
He's the liar.

327
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,321
All right. Answer yes or no.

328
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:08,351
Would he tell me that this door
leads to the castle?

329
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,261
Yes.

330
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:20,261
Then the other door leads
to the castle...

331
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,271
and this door leads
to certain death.

332
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,031
- Ooh!
- How do you know?

333
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:27,971
- He could be telling the truth.
- But then you wouldn't be.

334
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,741
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.

335
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:33,651
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.

336
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,171
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.

337
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:39,351
Wait a minute. Is that right?

338
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:42,051
I don't know.
I've never understood it.

339
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:46,491
No, it's right.
I figured it out.

340
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:48,721
I could never do it before.

341
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,761
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.

342
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,441
Help!

343
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,511
Stop it! Help!

344
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:06,311
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.

345
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:08,371
We're helping hands.

346
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:10,081
You're hurting.

347
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:12,921
Would you like us to let go?

348
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,591
Well, then come on,
which way?

349
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,061
Which way?

350
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,891
Up or down?

351
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,491
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

352
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,501
We haven't got all day.

353
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:30,371
Well, it's a big decision for her.

354
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:33,411
Which way do you want to go, hmm?

355
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,811
Yes, which way?

356
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,681
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.

357
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:43,811
She chose down.

358
00:29:43,891 --> 00:29:46,081
She chose down?

359
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,021
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.

360
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:05,071
She's in the oubliette.

361
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,201
Shut up! She should not have gotten
as far as the oubliette.

362
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:11,681
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.

363
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:14,981
Won't she? The dwarf's about
to lead her back to the beginning.

364
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:19,541
She'll soon give up when she realizes
she has to start all over again.

365
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,591
Well, laugh.

366
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,771
Who's there?

367
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,271
Me.

368
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:39,271
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh, yes, well...

369
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:42,401
I knew you were gonna get into trouble
as soon as I met you...

370
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:44,951
so I've come to give you a hand.

371
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,441
Oh, you're looking around now,
aren't you?

372
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:51,351
I suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.

373
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:53,351
Only the hole.

374
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,891
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.

375
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:01,051
- Really? How do you know that?
- Oh, don't sound so smart.

376
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:04,391
- You don't know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?

377
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,491
Yes, it's a place you put people...

378
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,701
to forget about 'em.

379
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:13,401
Now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.

380
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,411
And it so happens
that I know a short cut...

381
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,571
out of the whole labyrinth
from here.

382
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:20,841
No, I'm not giving up now.

383
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,851
I've come too far.

384
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:30,561
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Of course you are.

385
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:33,821
But it gets a lot worse
from here on in.

386
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,631
Why are you so concerned about me?

387
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,601
Well, I am, that's all.

388
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:45,111
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.

389
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,541
You like jewelry, don't you?

390
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,241
Why?

391
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:54,181
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.

392
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,981
You like it, don't you?

393
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:02,151
- So-so.
- Oh. Okay.

394
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,791
Tell you what--
you give me the bracelet...

395
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,801
and I'll show you the way
out of the labyrinth.

396
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,531
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes.

397
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:15,971
That's what would make it a
particularly nice gesture on your part.

398
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,801
I'll tell you what--

399
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,671
if you won't take me to the center,
take me as far as you can.

400
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:24,111
- Then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?

401
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,411
Plastic.

402
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,741
I don't promise nothing, but...

403
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:35,781
I'll take you as far as I can,
then you're on your own, right?

404
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:38,021
- Right.
- Right.

405
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:41,301
Wow. Plastic!

406
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:47,701
Here we go.

407
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,971
Damn.

408
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,481
Broom closet.

409
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:01,651
Well, can't be right
all the time.

410
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:07,751
This is it. Come on then.

411
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:18,361
- This way.
- Don't go on.

412
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:21,731
Go back while you still can.

413
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:24,971
This is not the way.

414
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:28,571
Take heed and go no further.

415
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:32,941
Beware. Beware.

416
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,481
Soon it will be too late.

417
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,851
Yeah! Don't pay
any attention to them.

418
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:41,481
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

419
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,551
Especially when you're
on the right track.

420
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,561
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, shut up.

421
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:49,831
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.

422
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:52,921
- Beware for--
- Just forget it.

423
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:56,661
Oh, please, I haven't said it
for such a long time.

424
00:33:56,741 --> 00:34:00,231
Oh, all right, but don't
expect a big reaction.

425
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:03,041
No, no, no, of course not.

426
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:07,241
For the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.

427
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,251
- Thank you very much.
- Uh-oh.

428
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,441
Oh, no.

429
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,751
What have we here?

430
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:22,161
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

431
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,961
Nothing? Nothing?

432
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,971
Nothing, tra-la-la.

433
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:30,031
Your Majesty,
what a nice surprise.

434
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,271
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.

435
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:33,771
Hoggle!

436
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:36,711
Hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?

437
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:39,651
Helping? In what sense?

438
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,181
In the sense that you're
leading her towards the castle.

439
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:45,521
No, I was taking her back
to the beginning, Your Majesty.

440
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,021
What?

441
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:50,581
I told her I was going to
help her solve the labyrinth.

442
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:53,861
A little trickery on my part.
But actually--

443
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:56,991
What is that plastic thing
'round your wrist?

444
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:00,861
Oh, this!

445
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,661
My goodness,
where did this come from?

446
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:07,261
- Higgle--
- Hoggle.

447
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,071
If I thought for one second
that you were betraying me...

448
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:14,101
I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst
in the Bog of Eternal Stench.

449
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:18,281
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!

450
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,291
Oh, yes, Hoggle!

451
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:22,881
And you, Sarah.

452
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:24,951
How are you enjoying
my Labyrinth?

453
00:35:27,331 --> 00:35:29,261
It's a piece of cake.

454
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:30,991
Oh!

455
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:34,401
Really? Then how about
upping the stakes?

456
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,801
Hmm?

457
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,431
That's not fair!

458
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,601
You say that so often.

459
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:44,541
I wonder what your basis
for comparison is.

460
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:47,081
So the labyrinth's
a piece of cake, is it?

461
00:35:47,151 --> 00:35:50,641
Well, let's see how you deal
with this little slice.

462
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:00,431
Oh, no, the cleaners!

463
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:02,431
- What?
- Run!

464
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,601
You okay?

465
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,611
Come on!

466
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:17,441
Faster!

467
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,051
The cleaners!
The Bog of Stench!

468
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,751
You sure got his attention.

469
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,871
Ah, this is what we need.

470
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,211
A ladder. Follow me.

471
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,951
How can I trust you now that I know you
were taking me back to the beginning?

472
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:03,581
I wasn't.

473
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:08,101
I told him I was taking you back to the
beginning to throw him off the scent.

474
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,961
Hoggle, how can I believe
anything you say?

475
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:13,831
Well, let me put it this way.

476
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,031
What choice have you got?

477
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,841
You're right.

478
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:25,641
You see, you've gotta
understand my position.

479
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:29,211
I'm a coward,
and Jareth scares me.

480
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:33,381
- What kind of position is that?
- No position. That's my point.

481
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,451
You wouldn't be so brave
if you'd ever smelled...

482
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,621
the Bog of Eternal Stench.

483
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,751
It's-- It's--

484
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,031
Is that all it does,
is smell?

485
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:48,431
Believe me, that's enough.

486
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,231
But the worst thing is,
it you so much...

487
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,401
as put a foot
in the Bog of Stench...

488
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,711
you'll smell bad
for the rest of your life.

489
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,411
It'll never wash off.

490
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:07,281
Here we are then.
You're on your own from now on.

491
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,951
- What?
- That's it. I quit.

492
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:13,961
Wait a minute.

493
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:20,961
I didn't promise nothin'. I said
I'd take you as far as I could go.

494
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,801
You little cheat.
You nasty little cheat.

495
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:26,811
Don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.

496
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,931
Oh, yeah?

497
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,711
But them's my jewels!

498
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:34,241
You give 'em back.
Give them back. Give those back.

499
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,511
Give those back to me!

500
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:42,081
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?

501
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:46,221
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!

502
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,761
No, it isn't.

503
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:51,231
But that's the way it is.

504
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:03,311
Excuse me, please,
but can you help me?

505
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,571
Oh, a young girl!

506
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:10,681
And who is this?

507
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,551
- My friend.
- Oh, yes.

508
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,111
And what can I do for you?

509
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,291
Please, can you tell--
That is--

510
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:21,891
I have to get to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

511
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,901
Do you know the way?

512
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,191
Well, yes, now.

513
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:30,931
You want to get to the castle.

514
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:33,301
How's that for brain power, huh?

515
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,671
Be quiet!

516
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,511
Ah, nuts.

517
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,641
So, young woman...

518
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:44,081
the way forward
is sometimes the way back.

519
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,891
Will you listen to this crap!

520
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:52,121
- Will you please be quiet!
- Sorry. All right.

521
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:53,321
- Okay.
- Okay!

522
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,451
- All right.
- All right!

523
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:57,461
- What?
- Sorry.

524
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:00,931
Finished?

525
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:03,571
Yes.

526
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:07,401
Quite often, young lady...

527
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:11,881
it seems like we're not getting
anywhere, when in fact--

528
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,311
- We are.
- We are.

529
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:18,681
I'm certainly not getting
anywhere at the moment.

530
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,981
Join the club.

531
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,951
I think that's your lot.

532
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:30,261
Please leave a contribution
in the little box.

533
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,331
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

534
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:41,931
Well, I guess I can spare this.

535
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:50,181
Oh, you didn't
have to give him that.

536
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,191
He didn't tell you nothin'.

537
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:55,451
Well, then.
There go a couple of suckers.

538
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:00,891
Ah, it's so stimulating
being your hat.

539
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,191
Why-- Why did you say that...

540
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,391
about my being your friend?

541
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:08,961
Because you are.

542
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,131
You may not be much of a friend,
but you're the only one I've got here.

543
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,911
Do you hear something?

544
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:18,451
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.

545
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:21,141
I like that.

546
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:25,021
I ain't never been
no one's friend before.

547
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:29,351
- Good-bye!
- Wait a minute.

548
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,421
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?

549
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,891
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

550
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:36,931
He looks after himself,
like everyone.

551
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,761
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.

552
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,361
Hoggle, you coward!

553
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:47,171
Well, I'm not afraid.

554
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,611
Things aren't always
what they seem in this place.

555
00:41:56,921 --> 00:42:00,081
Try on this for size,
you big yeti!

556
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,781
We've got you now,
fuzz ball!

557
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:05,491
All together now.

558
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,571
If only I had something to throw.

559
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:25,781
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!

560
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:34,211
What happened? Who turned out
the light? I can't see!

561
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:39,021
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?

562
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:41,431
Who bite me? Who bite me?

563
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,531
- I can't see!
- What is going on?

564
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,371
Retreat!

565
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:55,471
Who bit me?

566
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,981
Oh, my aching sushi!

567
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:12,461
Now, stop that.

568
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,321
Is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?

569
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:21,371
Don't you want me
to help you down?

570
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:27,241
Ludo down.

571
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:28,741
Ludo?

572
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,001
Is that your name?

573
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:37,481
You seem like such a nice beast.

574
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,761
Well, I certainly hope you
are what you seem to be.

575
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:46,591
Just hang on.
I'll get you down.

576
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:49,851
Just a second.

577
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,761
I'm sorry!

578
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:57,401
Ludo, are you hurt?

579
00:44:05,211 --> 00:44:06,311
Friend?

580
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,911
That's right, Ludo.

581
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,421
I'm Sarah.

582
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:13,251
Sarah.

583
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:17,551
Here, let me help you.

584
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,561
Are you okay?

585
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:28,601
Sarah friend.

586
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:31,161
Now, wait. Just a second.

587
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:35,011
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- What?

588
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:38,671
I have to get to the castle at the
labyrinth's center. Do you know the way?

589
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:48,851
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?

590
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:51,481
I wonder if anyone knows how
to get through this labyrinth.

591
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:56,691
Get through the Labyrinth.
Get through the Labyrinth.

592
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:00,631
One thing for sure-- she'll never
get through the labyrinth.

593
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,401
Hey.

594
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:10,971
Where did they come from?

595
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:15,581
What do you think?

596
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:18,311
Which shall we choose
out of these two ugly characters?

597
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:26,351
It's very rude to stare!

598
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:29,261
I'm sorry. I was just wondering
which door to choose.

599
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:31,531
- What?
- It's no good asking him.

600
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,831
- He's as deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

601
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,431
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.

602
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,631
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?

603
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:47,711
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?

604
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,881
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's as deaf as a post.

605
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:54,791
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful
conversational companion.

606
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:57,151
You can talk!
All you do is moan!

607
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,421
No good. Can't hear you.

608
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:03,201
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?

609
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:07,061
Search me.
We're just the knockers.

610
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,271
- How do I get through?
- Huh?

611
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:17,711
Knock, and the door will open.

612
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,681
I don't want that thing
back in my mouth.

613
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:31,191
- Come on. I want to knock.
- Mm-mmm.

614
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,991
Doesn't want his ring
back in his mouth, eh?

615
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,461
Can't say I blame him.

616
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,981
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

617
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:08,951
Come on.

618
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:29,781
You're welcome.

619
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:38,121
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.

620
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:40,961
He's got my eyes.

621
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,981
Ludo scared.

622
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:00,781
Aw, give me your hand.

623
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,511
Come on.

624
00:48:02,581 --> 00:48:05,251
Imagine a big thing like you
being scared.

625
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,751
Yeah.

626
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:11,191
See, Ludo? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

627
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,311
Ludo, where are you?

628
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,481
Hoggle, help!

629
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:44,791
- I'm comin', Sarah.
- Well, if it isn't you.

630
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:47,491
And where are you going?

631
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:51,601
Well, the little lady
gave me the slip...

632
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:54,361
but I just hears her now...

633
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:57,671
so I was about to lead her
back to the beginning...

634
00:48:57,741 --> 00:48:59,831
like you told me.

635
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:02,141
- I see.
- Ludo!

636
00:49:02,211 --> 00:49:05,041
For one moment I thought
you were running to help her.

637
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:08,781
But no, not after my warnings.

638
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:12,111
- That would be stupid.
- Oh, you bet it would!

639
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,821
Me help her
after your warnings?

640
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:22,231
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.

641
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,701
I've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.

642
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:30,171
Oh, yes, so they are.

643
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:33,231
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

644
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:36,401
I better find 'em, but first
I'm off to take the little lady...

645
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:39,471
back to the beginning of the labyrinth,
just like we planned.

646
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,241
Wait.

647
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,341
I've got a much better plan.

648
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:47,081
Give her this.

649
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:51,551
Wha-- What is it?

650
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:53,181
It's a present.

651
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,561
It ain't gonna hurt
the little lady, is it?

652
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:57,321
Why the concern?

653
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:02,271
- I won't do nothin' to harm her.
- Oh, come, come, Hogbrain.

654
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:04,831
I'm surprised at you
losing your head over a girl.

655
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,811
I ain't lost my head.

656
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:09,211
You don't think a young girl
could ever like...

657
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:12,971
a repulsive little scab
like you, do you?

658
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,071
She said we was--

659
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:17,381
Bosom companions?

660
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:19,081
Friends?

661
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:22,511
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that...

662
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,721
or I'll tip you straight
into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

663
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:27,731
before you can blink.

664
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:29,351
Yes. Right.

665
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:33,531
And Hoggle...

666
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:36,801
if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.

667
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:38,861
You-- You will?

668
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:41,311
Prince of the Land of Stench.

669
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,111
Ludo?

670
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:58,421
What's going on?

671
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:04,061
- What do you want?
- What, us?

672
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,491
We're just after
having a good time.

673
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:09,701
That's right!

674
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:16,871
<i>- Don't got no problems
- No problems</i>

675
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,881
<i>- Ain't got no suitcase
- No suitcase</i>

676
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,141
<i>- Ain't got no clothes to worry about
- No clothes to worry about</i>

677
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:25,551
<i>Ain't got no real estate or jewelry
or gold mines to hang me up</i>

678
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,981
<i>- I just throw in my hand
- Throw in his hand</i>

679
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:32,051
<i>With the chilliest bunch
in the land</i>

680
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,191
<i>- In the land
- They don't look like much</i>

681
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,821
<i>They're so chilly chilly</i>

682
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:38,991
<i>They positively glow glow
Chilly down</i>

683
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,431
<i>With the wild gang</i>

684
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:44,731
<i>Think small with the wild gang</i>

685
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,241
<i>Bang heads with the wild gang</i>

686
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,041
Like the man said,
don't lose your head.

687
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:52,311
<i>When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down</i>

688
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:55,251
<i>- With the wild gang
- Hey, I'm a wild child</i>

689
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,111
<i>Let's fly with the wild gang</i>

690
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,811
Walk tall.

691
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:02,621
<i>- Good time, bad food</i>
- Yeah.

692
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,221
<i>When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down</i>

693
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:08,991
Roll 'em.

694
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,121
Snake eyes!

695
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,741
Hey, Lady!

696
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,241
Fore!

697
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,121
<i>- So when things get too tough
- Get too tough</i>

698
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:38,951
<i>- Your chin is dragging on the ground
- Dragging on the ground</i>

699
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,591
<i>- And even down looks up
- Down looks up</i>

700
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,101
<i>Bad luck</i>

701
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:49,201
<i>- We can show you a good time
- Show you a good time</i>

702
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:51,931
<i>- And we don't charge nothing
- Nothing at all</i>

703
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:55,341
<i>Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle, yeah</i>

704
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,881
<i>Get the town talking, bad gang</i>

705
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:00,811
<i>- Chilly down with the wild gang
- Think small</i>

706
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:03,281
<i>Think small with the wild gang</i>

707
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:06,551
- Bang heads!
<i>- Bang heads with the wild gang</i>

708
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:08,181
Hey, listen up.

709
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:11,191
<i>When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down</i>

710
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:13,281
<i>With the wild gang</i>

711
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:16,451
- Shake your pretty Little head.
<i>- Act tall with the wild gang</i>

712
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:19,121
- Tap your pretty little feet.
<i>- Good times, bad food</i>

713
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,631
Come on!

714
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:26,301
Hey, hey!
Her head don't come off.

715
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,601
Of course it doesn't!

716
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,971
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.

717
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:32,981
Where you going
with a head like that?

718
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:37,181
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!

719
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:39,581
Yeah, let's take her apart.

720
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:41,421
Lady, that's his head.

721
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:43,681
- That's my head!
- That's a friend of mine.

722
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:46,391
What are you doing?

723
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:49,621
Hey! Wait!

724
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:54,191
Hey, lady...

725
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:57,261
it's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.

726
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,741
You're only allowed
to throw your own head.

727
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:01,501
Yeah, that's right.

728
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:03,911
Where's the referee?

729
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:06,281
We'll just take your head off.

730
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:10,511
- Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.

731
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,081
- Play the game.
- Yeah, we're going to throw your head.

732
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,181
You can't quit.
The game's not over.

733
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:19,421
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!

734
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:23,691
- We get a free throw.
- Don't you want to take your head off?

735
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,731
- Of course she does.
- Grab it!

736
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:30,201
- Don't you want to look like us?
- Leave me alone.

737
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:33,761
We want her! Get us all!

738
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,741
If you play,
we'll take off your arms!

739
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:40,801
- Or we'll take off your ear.
- You don't need two ears.

740
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:43,181
- Game's almost over.
- Time's up.

741
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,621
- Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.

742
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:52,821
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!

743
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:56,331
No, no, no!

744
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:04,991
Hoggle, hold on.

745
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,941
Oh, my God.

746
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,821
Oh, what is it?

747
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:20,821
The Bog of Eternal Stench!

748
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,591
I never smelled anything like it.
It's like--

749
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:35,891
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.

750
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:37,401
Help!

751
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:41,811
Hold on.

752
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:48,051
What did you have to go
and do a thing like that for?

753
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:49,211
Do what?

754
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:55,111
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.

755
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:57,321
You kissed me.

756
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,801
Oh, my gosh.

757
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:08,801
Don't pretend to be so hard.

758
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:12,701
I know you came back to help me,
and I know that you're my friend.

759
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:14,601
Did not. Am not.

760
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:17,911
I just come
to get me property back.

761
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:19,841
Oh, and...

762
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:22,541
give you-- give you--

763
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:24,741
Give me what?

764
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:33,791
Ludo!

765
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:36,021
Smell!

766
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,891
Where's Hoggle?

767
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:42,131
Get off of me!

768
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:44,771
Here.

769
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:51,271
Oh, no, it's okay.
This is Ludo. He's a friend too.

770
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,641
A what?

771
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:54,481
Smell!

772
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,951
You're right.

773
00:56:59,091 --> 00:57:01,521
Oh, my God.

774
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:06,031
There's a bridge.

775
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:07,921
Come on.

776
00:57:12,901 --> 00:57:13,991
Watch it.

777
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:17,761
You step in this stuff
and you'll stink forever.

778
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:21,101
Stop!

779
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:25,311
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.

780
00:57:25,381 --> 00:57:27,611
Without my permission,
no one may cross.

781
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:30,741
Please, I only have
a little time left!

782
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,011
We've gotta get out of this stench.

783
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:35,251
Smell bad.

784
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:38,121
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.

785
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:42,591
- I smell nothing.
- Oh, you're joking.

786
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:45,431
But I live
by my sense of smell.

787
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:52,101
The air is sweet and fragrant,
and none may pass without my permission!

788
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:55,141
Smell bad.

789
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,611
Oh, get out of my way!

790
00:57:57,681 --> 00:58:00,611
I warn thee,
I'm sworn to do my duty!

791
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,541
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!

792
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:11,511
Listen, I don't want to
have to hurt you.

793
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:13,221
What are you doing?

794
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,731
Let go of my staff, sir!

795
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:26,161
All right then.
I can conquer this mountain.

796
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:50,151
Thou must do better than that.

797
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,491
Give up? Huh?

798
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:09,041
Enough!

799
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:13,751
Before this day, never have I
met my match in battle.

800
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:18,421
Yet this noble knight
has fought me to a standstill.

801
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:22,051
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!

802
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:26,261
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name,
now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

803
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:29,271
Come, Let us be brothers
henceforth...

804
00:59:29,341 --> 00:59:31,961
and fight for the right as one!

805
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:37,381
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.

806
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,541
Steady.

807
00:59:39,781 --> 00:59:42,311
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.

808
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:45,871
Wait a minute!
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

809
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:49,751
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you said Ludo is your brother.

810
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:53,261
I have taken an oath,
and I must defend it to the death.

811
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:56,061
- The smell!
- Okay.

812
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:59,621
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?

813
00:59:59,701 --> 01:00:03,801
I have sworn with my lifeblood
no one shall pass this way...

814
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:06,131
without my permission.

815
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:11,641
Well, may we have your permission?

816
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:14,251
Well, I--

817
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,251
- Yes.
- Thank you, noble sir.

818
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:26,691
My lady.

819
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:33,301
- Uh-oh.
- Have no fear, sweet lady.

820
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:35,701
This bridge has lasted
for a thousand years.

821
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:48,341
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!

822
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:55,281
Fear not, fair maiden.
I will save thee.

823
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:56,381
Somehow.

824
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:02,591
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl
when yon maiden needs our help?

825
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:35,291
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!

826
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:37,661
Canst thou summon up
the very rocks?

827
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:41,831
Sure. Rocks friends.

828
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:49,571
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.

829
01:01:53,581 --> 01:01:55,511
Be careful, Ludo.

830
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:04,751
Wait for me.

831
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:09,091
Ambrosious, it's all right.
You can come out now.

832
01:02:09,161 --> 01:02:12,721
Come on. That-a boy.

833
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:15,631
My loyal steed. Steady.

834
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:21,831
Forward. Steady, boy.

835
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:25,401
Come on, Ambrosious.
Just close your eyes and go.

836
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:31,121
Let's get out of here.

837
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:36,821
Excuse us. Thank you.

838
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:46,231
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

839
01:02:46,301 --> 01:02:49,791
Oh, please,
I can't give it to her.

840
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:57,071
Come on then. We should reach
the castle well before day.

841
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:07,421
Look, Sarah, is this
what you're trying to find?

842
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:13,651
So much trouble over such
a little thing, but not for long.

843
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:18,191
She'll soon forget all about you,
my fine fellow.

844
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,391
Just as soon as Hoggle
gives her my present...

845
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:24,671
then she'll forget everything.

846
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:29,241
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosious?

847
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:32,011
Hungry.

848
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:37,581
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

849
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:40,591
Maybe we can find
some berries or something.

850
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:45,381
Yeah?

851
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:46,691
Here.

852
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:51,621
Thank you!

853
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:53,831
You're a lifesaver.

854
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,801
This tastes strange.

855
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:14,521
What have you done?

856
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,921
Oh, damn you, Jareth.

857
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:20,391
And damn me too.

858
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,771
Everything's dancing.

859
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:42,141
Yea, verily.
Whoa, Ambrosious, whoa!

860
01:05:42,211 --> 01:05:46,511
The castle doth lie yonder,
my lady.

861
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:48,511
My lady?

862
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:41,831
<i>There's such a sad love</i>

863
01:06:41,901 --> 01:06:46,931
<i>Deep in your eyes
A kind of pale jewel</i>

864
01:06:47,011 --> 01:06:50,741
<i>Open and closed
within your eyes</i>

865
01:06:50,811 --> 01:06:53,281
<i>I'll place the sky</i>

866
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:56,541
<i>Within your eyes</i>

867
01:06:58,021 --> 01:07:01,451
<i>There's such a fooled heart</i>

868
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:03,081
<i>Beating so fast</i>

869
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:05,491
<i>In search of new dreams</i>

870
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:07,961
<i>A love that will last</i>

871
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:10,221
<i>Within your heart</i>

872
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:12,791
<i>I'll place the moon</i>

873
01:07:12,871 --> 01:07:16,431
<i>Within your heart</i>

874
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,201
<i>As the pain sweeps through</i>

875
01:07:20,271 --> 01:07:22,671
<i>Makes no sense for you</i>

876
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:25,111
<i>Every thrill has gone</i>

877
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:29,141
<i>Wasn't too much fun at all</i>

878
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:35,141
<i>But I'll be there for you</i>

879
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:39,751
<i>As the world falls down</i>

880
01:07:39,831 --> 01:07:41,231
<i>Falling</i>

881
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:48,061
<i>- As the world falls down
- It's falling</i>

882
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,901
<i>Falling in love</i>

883
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:58,381
<i>I'll paint you mornings of gold</i>

884
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,541
<i>I'll spin you Valentine evenings</i>

885
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:06,381
<i>Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path</i>

886
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,551
<i>Between the stars</i>

887
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:11,111
<i>I'll lay my love</i>

888
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:14,461
<i>Between the stars</i>

889
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:18,631
<i>As the pain sweeps through</i>

890
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,261
<i>Makes no sense for you</i>

891
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,431
<i>Every thrill has gone</i>

892
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:27,371
<i>Wasn't too much fun at all</i>

893
01:08:29,641 --> 01:08:33,241
<i>But I'll be there for you</i>

894
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:37,971
<i>As the world falls down</i>

895
01:08:38,051 --> 01:08:39,481
<i>Falling</i>

896
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,151
<i>- As the world falls down
- It's falling</i>

897
01:08:50,231 --> 01:08:51,661
<i>It's falling</i>

898
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:10,751
<i>Falling in love</i>

899
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:48,081
Oh, she'll never forgive me.

900
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:50,251
What have I done?

901
01:09:50,321 --> 01:09:53,321
I've lost my only friend.

902
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:55,491
That's what I've done.

903
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:07,941
What was I doing?

904
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:21,951
Get off my back!

905
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:27,051
Why don't you look
where you're going...

906
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:29,091
young woman, hmm?

907
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:33,591
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?

908
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:36,691
Where were you going, hmm?

909
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:38,531
I don't remember.

910
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,871
You can't look where you're going
if you don't know where you're going.

911
01:10:41,941 --> 01:10:43,601
I was searching for something.

912
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:46,071
Look here.

913
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:52,421
Lancelot?

914
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,551
Thank you.

915
01:10:55,621 --> 01:11:00,121
That's what you were looking for,
wasn't it, my dear?

916
01:11:00,191 --> 01:11:03,321
Yes. I forgot.

917
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:06,421
Now, why don't you...

918
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:08,731
come in here...

919
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:11,741
and see if there's
anything else...

920
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:14,141
you'd like, hmm?

921
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,661
It was just a dream.

922
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:51,941
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.

923
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:56,271
But it was so real.

924
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:02,081
Let's go see if Daddy's back,
okay?

925
01:12:07,331 --> 01:12:09,791
Better to stay in here, dear.
Yes.

926
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:14,301
There's nothing you want
out there. No!

927
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,301
Oh, what have we got here?

928
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:18,801
Lancelot.

929
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:22,361
Your little bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.

930
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:24,841
Don't you? Yes, yes.
There you go.

931
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:27,401
There's Betsy Bou.
You remember Betsy Bou, don't you?

932
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:29,311
Yes, yes.

933
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:32,821
Now, then, what else have we got?
What's this? Let's have a look.

934
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,481
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.

935
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:40,051
Here's your panda slippers.
You know how much you like them.

936
01:12:40,131 --> 01:12:43,651
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right.

937
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:47,461
Okay, now then, what else?
Oh, it's little Horsey.

938
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,971
You love little Horsey,
don't you, dear?

939
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:54,131
And look at this!
You got a printing game, you have.

940
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:57,901
Oh, here's a treasure.
You'll want that, won't you, my dear?

941
01:12:57,981 --> 01:13:01,811
Yes, go on, put it on.
Make yourself up.

942
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:05,341
Here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her. There you go.

943
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:09,351
Oh, yes. Ah, oh, yes.

944
01:13:09,421 --> 01:13:13,221
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear for you.

945
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,231
There was something
I was looking for.

946
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,761
Ah, don't talk nonsense.

947
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:22,931
It's all here. Everything you've
ever cared about is all right here.

948
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:25,401
There's your little toy candy shop.

949
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:26,841
"Through dangers untold...

950
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:29,671
and hardships unnumbered...

951
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:34,151
I fought my way here
to the castle...

952
01:13:34,211 --> 01:13:36,841
beyond the Goblin City...

953
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:40,251
to take back the child
that you have stolen."

954
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:45,221
What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?

955
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,381
It's all junk.

956
01:13:49,031 --> 01:13:51,261
Well, what about this?

957
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:55,231
This is not junk, eh?

958
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:58,601
Yes, it is!

959
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:02,401
I have to save Toby!

960
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:08,181
My lady!

961
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:12,451
Are you all right?

962
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:21,851
Fair maiden. Thank goodness
thou art safe at last.

963
01:14:21,931 --> 01:14:24,161
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.

964
01:14:24,231 --> 01:14:26,661
My lady, we're almost there.

965
01:14:26,731 --> 01:14:29,201
Those are the gates
to the Goblin City.

966
01:14:29,271 --> 01:14:31,431
Ludo, Sir Didymus.

967
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,271
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.

968
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:37,671
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosious.

969
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,731
Forward.

970
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:41,251
You know.

971
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,711
Open up. Open the door.

972
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,951
Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.

973
01:14:51,091 --> 01:14:53,021
Open up. Open up right now!

974
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:54,581
You'll wake the guard.

975
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:55,991
Quiet.

976
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:58,831
Well, let them all wake up!

977
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:02,891
I shall fight you all
to the death!

978
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:08,341
Please, Sir Didymus,
for my sake, hush.

979
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:10,531
But of course.
For thee, anything.

980
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,981
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.

981
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,211
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.

982
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:18,911
Then I shall fight anyone
anywhere, anyplace, any time!

983
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,821
We know!

984
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,321
Now hush.

985
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,381
Quietly.

986
01:15:26,461 --> 01:15:28,891
Ambrosious, be quiet now.

987
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:32,561
I don't see why we
have to be so quiet.

988
01:15:32,631 --> 01:15:34,831
It's only a Goblin City.

989
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,831
I smell trouble.

990
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:44,071
Come on, Ludo.

991
01:15:45,411 --> 01:15:46,811
Oh, no.

992
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:52,621
What is that?

993
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:58,821
Who goes?

994
01:16:04,431 --> 01:16:06,261
Who goes?

995
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:23,211
Watch out!

996
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:39,161
Ambrosious, will you come here?

997
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,101
Come here right now!

998
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:47,571
Will you please come into the open?
You're embarrassing me.

999
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:04,411
Look out!

1000
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:08,751
Get out of there.

1001
01:17:10,031 --> 01:17:12,001
What are you doing?

1002
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:15,401
Bombs away!

1003
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,931
That wasn't very nice.

1004
01:17:22,741 --> 01:17:23,941
My turn now.

1005
01:17:25,711 --> 01:17:27,911
How do you drive this thing?

1006
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,781
Drop the ax!

1007
01:17:33,851 --> 01:17:36,151
I'm trying.

1008
01:17:36,221 --> 01:17:39,281
Come here at once.

1009
01:17:39,361 --> 01:17:41,621
What's happened?

1010
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:43,631
Where's reverse?

1011
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:53,731
Get out of there, Hoggle!

1012
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:55,541
Abandon ship.

1013
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:06,381
Hoggle, are you all right?

1014
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:11,221
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothin' I did.

1015
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:14,781
Jareth made me give you
that peach.

1016
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:18,491
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.

1017
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,561
I ain't interested
in being friends.

1018
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:23,401
I forgive you.

1019
01:18:24,971 --> 01:18:27,201
You-- You do?

1020
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:32,141
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.

1021
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:35,511
You are a valiant man,
Sir Hoggle.

1022
01:18:35,581 --> 01:18:38,241
- I am?
- Yeah.

1023
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:40,751
Hoggle and Ludo friends.

1024
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,521
- We are?
- Yeah.

1025
01:18:44,591 --> 01:18:46,111
Here are your things.

1026
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:48,751
Thanks for your help.

1027
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,321
Well, what are we waiting for?

1028
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:54,921
Let's get the rat
who calls himself Jareth.

1029
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:56,521
Right. Come on.

1030
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:59,541
Ambrosious, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1031
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:27,531
Your Highness!

1032
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:32,631
- Your Highness, the girl--
- What?

1033
01:19:32,711 --> 01:19:36,041
- Who ate the peach, forgot everything.
- What of her?

1034
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:39,271
She's here with the monster and Sir
Didymus and the dwarf who works for you.

1035
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:42,311
- What?
- They're on their way to the castle!

1036
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:46,371
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.

1037
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:47,541
Guards!

1038
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:50,611
She must be stopped.
Do something!

1039
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:54,721
Come on, move. Move!

1040
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:07,471
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Oh, piece of cake.

1041
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:17,111
Company, halt.

1042
01:20:23,721 --> 01:20:26,661
Lances ready!

1043
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:31,851
Cannon, fire!

1044
01:20:37,841 --> 01:20:40,671
Ambrosious, turn around.
Turn about.

1045
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:43,471
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!

1046
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:47,101
No, not that way!

1047
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:52,321
You're going the wrong way!

1048
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,321
The battle's behind us!

1049
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:02,091
Ambrosious, can we please
talk about this?

1050
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:03,591
Sit!

1051
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:10,661
Be careful. Okay.

1052
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,171
Through here.

1053
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:18,601
Ambrosious, stand still.

1054
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:21,481
Okay, come on, guys.

1055
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:25,811
Ambrosious, if you don't
turn around this second...

1056
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,681
I will never feed you again.

1057
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:32,391
That's better.

1058
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:36,991
Don't worry, Ambrosious.
I think we've got them surrounded.

1059
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:42,691
Didymus! Where's Didymus?

1060
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:45,201
Fire!

1061
01:21:47,271 --> 01:21:49,211
I hit something, yes? No?

1062
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,041
We've got to find Didymus.

1063
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:56,951
Down this way.

1064
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:17,201
Charge!

1065
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:26,041
Tallyho!

1066
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:32,481
Ambrosious, you coward.

1067
01:22:42,531 --> 01:22:44,931
Quick, in here.

1068
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,831
How's Ludo gonna get in?

1069
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:10,681
You in there,
you're surrounded!

1070
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:13,291
Surrounded?

1071
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,431
Get out!
Ludo, hold the roof!

1072
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:31,971
- Take that!
- Hungry?

1073
01:23:37,281 --> 01:23:40,151
Ambrosious, unlock this door.

1074
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,551
So, had enough, have you?

1075
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:53,221
Then throw down your weapons,
and I'll see that you're well-treated.

1076
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,761
Next time, surrender.

1077
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:34,601
Good grief!

1078
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:40,871
Steady, men.

1079
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:45,741
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

1080
01:24:50,521 --> 01:24:53,551
Okay, I take it back.
Run for your lives!

1081
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:56,821
I've had enough!
I'm going to bed.

1082
01:24:59,031 --> 01:25:01,021
Get out of my house!

1083
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:25,451
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!

1084
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:29,831
Missed!

1085
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:31,691
Okay, come on.

1086
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:35,631
Fire!

1087
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:40,201
Hey, I just fired you.

1088
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:42,101
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1089
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:46,411
This way.

1090
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:51,941
Now we have you!

1091
01:25:54,151 --> 01:25:55,591
And now you don't.

1092
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:15,171
Hey, no problem.

1093
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:21,311
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!

1094
01:26:23,621 --> 01:26:26,281
Hi-ho, Silver!

1095
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,861
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, big fella.
- This way.

1096
01:26:39,931 --> 01:26:41,361
Steady, boy.

1097
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:46,601
Ah, yes. Up we go. Up, up.

1098
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:50,841
Come on. Good boy.

1099
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,841
Come on.

1100
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:54,211
No.

1101
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:56,141
Good boy. Come on.

1102
01:26:57,581 --> 01:27:00,751
- That's the only way he could have gone.
- Well, then, come on.

1103
01:27:00,821 --> 01:27:04,261
- I have to face him alone.
- But why?

1104
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:06,451
Because that's the way it's done.

1105
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:09,091
Well, if that is the way
it is done...

1106
01:27:09,161 --> 01:27:11,431
then that is the way
you must do it.

1107
01:27:11,501 --> 01:27:14,291
But should you need us--

1108
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:17,531
Yes, should you need us--

1109
01:27:18,671 --> 01:27:20,071
I'll call.

1110
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:23,001
Thank you, all of you.

1111
01:27:48,131 --> 01:27:50,571
<i>How you've turned my world</i>

1112
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,931
<i>You precious thing</i>

1113
01:27:55,941 --> 01:27:59,341
<i>You starve and near exhaust me</i>

1114
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:03,441
<i>Everything I've done</i>

1115
01:28:03,521 --> 01:28:06,011
<i>I've done for you</i>

1116
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:11,151
<i>I move the stars for no one</i>

1117
01:28:15,931 --> 01:28:17,861
<i>You've run so long</i>

1118
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,661
<i>You've run so far</i>

1119
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:28,931
<i>Your eyes can be so cruel</i>

1120
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:35,671
<i>Just as I can be so cruel</i>

1121
01:28:40,451 --> 01:28:43,721
<i>Though I do believe in you</i>

1122
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:46,951
Toby!

1123
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:51,691
<i>Yes, I do</i>

1124
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:56,061
<i>Live without your sunlight</i>

1125
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,971
<i>Love without your heartbeat</i>

1126
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,071
<i>I, I can't live</i>

1127
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:11,341
<i>Within you</i>

1128
01:29:52,461 --> 01:29:54,861
Toby!

1129
01:30:55,821 --> 01:30:57,751
Give me the child.

1130
01:30:57,821 --> 01:31:00,151
Sarah, beware.

1131
01:31:00,231 --> 01:31:04,461
I have been generous up until now,
and I can be cruel.

1132
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:05,961
Generous?

1133
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:11,501
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!

1134
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:14,501
Everything that you have wanted,
I have done.

1135
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:18,511
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.

1136
01:31:18,581 --> 01:31:21,881
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.

1137
01:31:21,951 --> 01:31:24,311
I have reordered time.

1138
01:31:24,381 --> 01:31:27,111
I have turned the world
upside-down...

1139
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:29,781
and I have done it all for you.

1140
01:31:31,391 --> 01:31:35,381
I am exhausted from living up
to your expectations of me.

1141
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:36,651
Isn't that generous?

1142
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:43,461
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

1143
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:48,801
I have fought my way here to the castle
beyond the Goblin City.

1144
01:31:51,511 --> 01:31:53,441
For my will
is as strong as yours...

1145
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:57,741
- and my--
- Stop. Wait.

1146
01:31:57,821 --> 01:31:59,441
Look, Sarah.

1147
01:31:59,521 --> 01:32:03,211
Look what I'm offering you.

1148
01:32:03,291 --> 01:32:04,761
Your dreams.

1149
01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:09,551
And my kingdom as great--

1150
01:32:09,631 --> 01:32:12,461
I ask for so little.

1151
01:32:12,531 --> 01:32:15,061
Just let me rule you...

1152
01:32:15,131 --> 01:32:18,571
and you can have everything
that you want.

1153
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:24,801
Kingdom as great?

1154
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:26,211
Damn.

1155
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:28,541
I can never remember that line.

1156
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:32,411
Just fear me, love me,
do as I say...

1157
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:34,881
and I will be your slave.

1158
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:40,021
My kingdom as great--
My kingdom as great--

1159
01:32:46,701 --> 01:32:49,191
You have no power over me.

1160
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:53,991
You have no power over me.

1161
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,251
Toby.

1162
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:17,421
Here you are.

1163
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:20,461
I'd like Lancelot
to belong to you now.

1164
01:34:43,881 --> 01:34:45,321
We're home.

1165
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:54,151
Sarah, are you home?

1166
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,491
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.

1167
01:35:00,671 --> 01:35:02,601
Good-bye, Sarah.

1168
01:35:12,281 --> 01:35:13,801
Remember, fair maiden...

1169
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,811
should you need us--

1170
01:35:17,021 --> 01:35:19,251
Yes, should you need us...

1171
01:35:19,321 --> 01:35:22,221
for any reason at all--

1172
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:24,761
I need you, Hoggle.

1173
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:26,261
You do?

1174
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:30,081
I don't know why, but...

1175
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:32,761
every now and again
in my life...

1176
01:35:32,831 --> 01:35:36,201
for no reason at all,
I need you.

1177
01:35:36,271 --> 01:35:38,201
All of you.

1178
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:39,961
You do?

1179
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:43,371
Well, why didn't you say so?

1180
01:35:54,751 --> 01:35:56,911
- Oh, Ludo!
- Sarah.

1181
01:35:56,991 --> 01:36:00,581
Ambrosious,
good boy, good boy.

1182
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:10,231
I say, does anyone here
want to play a game of Scrabble?

1183
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:34,021
<i>- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?</i>

1184
01:36:34,091 --> 01:36:35,921
<i>- The babe with the power.
- What power?</i>

1185
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:38,161
<i>The power of voodoo. You do.</i>

1186
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:40,861
<i>- Do what?
- Remind me of the babe.</i>

1187
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:49,171
<i>- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
- Heard about a place today</i>

1188
01:36:49,241 --> 01:36:51,441
<i>I, I'm underground</i>

1189
01:36:51,511 --> 01:36:54,171
<i>Nothing ever hurts again</i>

1190
01:36:54,251 --> 01:36:57,811
<i>- Heard about a place today
- Daddy, get me out of here</i>

1191
01:36:57,881 --> 01:37:00,211
<i>Where nothing ever hurts again</i>

1192
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,381
<i>Wanna go underground</i>

1193
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:06,581
<i>- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
- Wanna go underground</i>

1194
01:37:06,661 --> 01:37:10,991
<i>- I, I'm underground
- Get me underground</i>

1195
01:37:11,061 --> 01:37:15,361
<i>- Sister, sister, please take me down
- Daddy, get me out of here</i>

1196
01:37:15,431 --> 01:37:17,771
<i>I, I'm underground</i>

1197
01:37:17,841 --> 01:37:19,801
<i>Wanna go underground</i>

1198
01:37:19,871 --> 01:37:23,141
<i>Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here</i>

1199
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:34,111
<i>No one can blame you</i>

1200
01:37:35,921 --> 01:37:38,321
<i>For walking away</i>

1201
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:43,491
<i>But too much rejection</i>

1202
01:37:44,961 --> 01:37:48,261
<i>No love injection</i>

1203
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:51,491
<i>Life can be easy</i>

1204
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:56,331
<i>It's not always swell</i>

1205
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:02,071
<i>Don't tell me truth hurts
little girl</i>

1206
01:38:02,151 --> 01:38:04,841
<i>'Cause it hurts like hell</i>

1207
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:08,991
<i>But down in the underground</i>

1208
01:38:10,921 --> 01:38:13,361
<i>You'll find someone true</i>

1209
01:38:14,991 --> 01:38:17,651
<i>Down in the underground</i>

1210
01:38:19,601 --> 01:38:21,831
<i>A land serene</i>

1211
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:24,931
<i>A crystal moon</i>

1212
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:31,301
<i>It's only forever</i>

1213
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:35,211
<i>Not long at all</i>

1214
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:39,951
<i>The lost and the lonely</i>

1215
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:43,881
<i>That's underground</i>

1216
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:46,981
<i>Underground</i>

1217
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:58,071
<i>- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
- Heard about a place today</i>

1218

<i>I, I'm underground</i>

1219
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,071
<i>Nothing ever hurts again</i>

1220
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:06,701
<i>- Heard about a place today
- Daddy, get me out of here</i>

1221
01:39:06,781 --> 01:39:09,111
<i>Where nothing ever hurts again</i>

1222
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:11,271
<i>Wanna go underground</i>

1223
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:15,481
<i>- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
