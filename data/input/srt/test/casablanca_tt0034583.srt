1
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,570
With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,910
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,910
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,790
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,170
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,250
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,920
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,600
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,400
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,110
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,870
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,540
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,160
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,540
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,710
And wait and wait...

16
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
...and wait.

17
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,940
To all officers:

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,980
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,190
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,950
lmportant.

22
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,110
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,110
l don't think l have them on me.

24
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,610
-ln that case, you'll have to come along.
-Wait. lt's possible that l....

25
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,910
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,950
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,790
Halt!

28
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,080
Halt!

29
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,690
-What on earth is going on there?
-l don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,360
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,330
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,950
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
The unoccupied desert.

34
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,870
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,670
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

36
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Along with these unhappy refugees...

37
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,930
...the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

38
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,140
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

39
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,350
l beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

40
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
This place is full of vultures.

41
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,480
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

42
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,400
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Not at all. Au revoir, monsieur.

43
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,110
-Au revoir, madame.
-Au revoir.

44
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,150
What an amusing little fellow.

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,660
Waiter.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,030
-Oh, how silly of me.
-What, dear?

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,580
l've left my wallet in the hotel.

48
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,390
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

49
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,620
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

50
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,830
lt is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,210
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,670
May l present Captain Renault, police
prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,880
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

54
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,050
Thank you, captain.
lt's good to be here.

55
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,890
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

56
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,520
Captain Tonnelli.
The ltalian service at your command.

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,890
That is kind of you.

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,190
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,030
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

60
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,320
Perhaps you
weren't referring to weather.

61
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,580
What else?

62
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

63
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,710
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

64
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,670
But we know already
who the murderer is.

65
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,920
Good. ls he in custody?

66
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,050
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

67
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,720
l've already heard about this cafÃ©.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

68
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,180
lt had to be you
lt had to be you

69
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,190
l wandered around and finally found
The somebody who

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,450
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue

71
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,620
And even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you

72
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,870
Some others l've seen
Might never be mean

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,090
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

74
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,800
For nobody else gave me a thrill

75
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,720
Honey, with all your faults
l love you still

76
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,930
Had to be you, wonderful you
Had to be you

77
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,480
'Cause my hair is curly

78
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,190
'Cause my teeth are pearly

79
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,480
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

80
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,690
l'll never get out of here.

81
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,900
l'll die in Casablanca.

82
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,320
But can't you make it
just a little more?

83
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,530
Please?

84
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,120
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

85
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,540
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

86
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,870
All right.

87
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,830
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,970
lt's the fishing smack Santiago.

89
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,550
lt leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here
from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,020
-Thank you. Thank you.
-And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

91
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,480
Remember, in cash.

92
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,360
Cheerio.

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,070
-Open up, Abdul.
-Yes, professor.

94
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,790
-Waiter?
-Yes, madame?

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,670
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,340
He never drinks with customers.
Never. l have never seen it.

97
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,380
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

98
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,840
Perhaps if you told him...

99
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,600
...l ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

100
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,260
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

101
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,980
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

102
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,690
We have something
to look forward to.

103
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,190
And his father is the bellboy.

104
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,400
Monsieur.

105
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,390
Excuse me.

106
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,020
l'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

107
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,810
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
l know there is gambling in there.

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,150
-You dare not keep me out.
Yes? What's the trouble?

109
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
l have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

110
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,530
And if you think l'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this...

111
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,830
...you're much mistaken.

112
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,700
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

113
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,160
Your cash is good at the bar.

114
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,330
What? Do you know who l am?

115
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,500
l do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

116
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,670
This is outrageous!
l shall report it to The Angriff.

117
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,010
Watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

118
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,020
-What makes you think l haven't?
-Nothing.

119
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,190
-But when you first came, l thought--
-You thought what?

120
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,860
What right do l have to think?

121
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,200
May l?

122
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,870
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

123
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,700
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

124
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,160
...today they are the honored dead.

125
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,210
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

126
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,540
l forgive you.

127
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,380
-Will you have a drink with me?
-No.

128
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,550
l forgot, you never drink with--
l'll have another, please.

129
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,220
You despise me, don't you?

130
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,600
lf l gave you any thought,
l probably would.

131
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,100
But why?

132
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,220
Do you object
to the kind of business l do?

133
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,400
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if l didn't help them.

134
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,150
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, l provide them with exit visas.

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,570
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

136
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,160
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

137
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,750
l get it for them for half.
ls that so parasitic?

138
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,540
l don't mind a parasite.
l object to a cut-rate one.

139
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,090
Well, after tonight l will be through
with the whole business.

140
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,960
And l'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

141
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,220
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

142
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,890
Myself.
l found myself much more reasonable.

143
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,430
Look, Rick.

144
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,770
Know what this is?

145
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,060
Something that even you
have never seen.

146
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,400
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

147
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,860
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

148
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,070
One moment.

149
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,530
Tonight l'll be selling those
for more money than l ever dreamed of.

150
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,530
And then, addio, Casablanca.

151
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,450
l have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow...

152
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,670
...just because you despise me,
you are the only one l trust.

153
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,750
Will you keep these for me, please?

154
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,710
-For how long?
-Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

155
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,630
-l don't want them here overnight.
-Don't be afraid of that.

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,430
Please keep them for me.

157
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,800
Thank you.
l knew l could trust you.

158
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Waiter. l'll be expecting some people.

159
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,350
lf anybody asks for me,
l'll be right here.

160
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Rick...

161
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,900
...l hope you're more impressed
with me now.

162
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,480
lf you'll forgive me, l'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

163
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,780
Just a moment.

164
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,990
l heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

165
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,660
Huh?

166
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh. l've heard that
rumor too. Poor devils.

167
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,420
You're right, Ugarte.
l am a little more impressed with you.

168
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,720
-Say, who's got trouble?
-We got trouble

169
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,680
-How much trouble?
-Too much trouble

170
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,150
Well, now, don't you frown
Just knuckle down and knock on wood

171
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,980
-Who's unhappy?
-We're unhappy

172
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,280
-How unhappy?
-Too unhappy

173
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,910
Uh-oh, that won't do
When you are blue just knock on wood

174
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,830
-Who's unlucky?
-We're unlucky

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,160
-How unlucky?
-Too unlucky

176
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,460
But your luck will change
lf you'll arrange to knock on wood

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,250
-Who's got nothing?
-We got nothing

178
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,010
-How much nothing?
-Too much nothing

179
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,350
Say, nothing's not an awful lot
But knock on wood

180
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,470
-Now who's happy?
-We're happy

181
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,940
-Just how happy?
-Very happy

182
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,270
That's the way we're gonna say
So knock on wood

183
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,030
-Now who's lucky?
-We're all lucky

184
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,200
-Just how lucky?
-Very lucky

185
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,240
Well, smile again and once again
Let's knock on wood

186
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,250
-Hello, Rick.
-Hello, Ferrari.

187
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,090
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

188
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,760
-Fine, but l'd like to buy your cafÃ©.
-lt's not for sale.

189
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,180
-You haven't heard my offer.
-lt's not for sale at any price.

190
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,930
-What do you want for Sam?
-l don't buy or sell human beings.

191
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,270
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

192
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,350
ln refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

193
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
...if you'd work with me
in the black market.

194
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,110
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

195
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,360
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

196
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,610
Suppose we do.

197
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,150
When will you realize
that in this world today...

198
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,780
...isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

199
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,700
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

200
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,950
Oh, l like it fine here.

201
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,540
He'll double what l pay you.

202
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,040
l ain't got time to spend
what l make here.

203
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,500
Sorry.

204
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,670
The boss's private stock...

205
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,300
-...because, Yvonne, l love you.
-Oh, shut up.

206
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,470
All right, all right. For you, l shut up,
because, Yvonne, l love you.

207
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
Uh-oh.

208
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,890
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

209
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,810
Some Germans gave this check.
ls it all right?

210
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,320
Where were you last night?

211
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,780
That's so long ago,
l don't remember.

212
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,450
-Will l see you tonight?
-l never make plans that far ahead.

213
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,990
Give me another.

214
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,910
-Sascha, she's had enough.
-Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

215
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,290
Yvonne, l love you,
but he pays me.

216
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
-Rick, l'm tired of having you--
-Sascha, call a cab.

217
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,550
-We're gonna get your coat.
-Take your hands off me.

218
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,300
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

219
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,720
Hey, taxi.

220
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,600
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

221
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,520
l was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

222
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,730
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

223
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,560
-And come right back.
-Yes, boss.

224
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,030
-Hello, Rick.
-Hello, Louis.

225
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,500
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

226
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,370
Someday they may be scarce.

227
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,830
l think now
l shall pay a call on Yvonne.

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,630
Maybe get her on the rebound.

229
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,920
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

230
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,230
lf he gets a word in,
it'll be a major ltalian victory.

231
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,230
The plane to Lisbon.

232
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
You would like to be on it?

233
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,570
Why? What's in Lisbon?

234
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,780
The clipper to America.

235
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,700
l've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

236
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,830
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

237
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,920
l like to think you killed a man.
lt's the romantic in me.

238
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,750
lt's a combination of all three.

239
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,420
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

240
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,050
My health.
l came to Casablanca for the waters.

241
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,510
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

242
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,520
-l was misinformed.
-Hm.

243
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,850
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

244
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,860
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

245
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,440
...and the cashier
would like some money.

246
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,030
l'll get it from the safe.

247
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,780
l'm so upset, Rick. You know l--

248
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,570
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

249
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,530
l'm awfully sorry.

250
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,790
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your cafÃ©.

251
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,670
-Again?
-This is no ordinary arrest.

252
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,250
A murderer, no less.

253
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,470
lf you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

254
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,470
-l stick my neck out for nobody.
-A wise foreign policy.

255
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,770
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

256
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,060
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

257
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,730
lt will amuse your customers.

258
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
Our entertainment's enough.

259
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,030
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

260
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,740
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

261
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,080
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

262
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,830
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

263
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,910
l see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

264
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,000
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

265
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,340
-Perhaps not.
-Here.

266
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,630
-lt shall not happen again.
-That's all right.

267
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,670
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

268
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,340
How observant you are.

269
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,350
As a matter of fact,
l wanted to give you a word of advice.

270
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,550
Yeah?

271
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,140
-Have a brandy?
-Thank you.

272
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,230
There are many exit visas
sold in this cafÃ©...

273
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,270
...but we know
that you've never sold one.

274
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,940
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

275
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,400
l thought it was because
l let you win at roulette.

276
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,820
That is another reason.

277
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,780
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

278
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,870
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

279
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,540
-What's his name?
-Victor Laszlo.

280
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,330
Victor Laszlo?

281
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,080
Rick, that is the first time
l've seen you so impressed.

282
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,250
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

283
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,880
lt's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

284
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,050
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

285
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,300
lt'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

286
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,640
-Manages what?
-His escape.

287
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,720
-But l just told you--
-Stop it.

288
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,720
He escaped from
a concentration camp.

289
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,850
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

290
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,860
-This is the end of the chase.
-Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

291
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,400
ls that a serious offer?

292
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,900
l just paid out 20,
and l'd like to get it back.

293
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,900
Make it 10.
l'm only a poor corrupt official.

294
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,910
-Okay.
-Done.

295
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,120
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or l should say two.

296
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,620
-Why two?
-He is traveling with a lady.

297
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,540
-He'll take one.
-l think not. l've seen the lady.

298
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,460
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,090
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

300
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,420
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

301
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,890
lt doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

302
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,100
Whatever gave you the impression
that l might help Laszlo escape?

303
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,640
Because, my dear Ricky,
l suspect that under that cynical shell...

304
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,560
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

305
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,110
Laugh if you will, but l happen
to be familiar with your record.

306
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,440
Let me point out just two items:

307
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,780
ln 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

308
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,870
ln 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

309
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,370
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

310
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,870
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

311
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,170
-Maybe.
-Uh-huh.

312
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,540
lt seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

313
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,500
l have my orders.

314
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,130
l see. Gestapo spank.

315
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,140
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

316
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,680
l don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

317
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,970
ln Casablanca, l am master of my fate.

318
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,310
-l am--
-Major Strasser is here, sir.

319
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,690
-You were saying?
-Excuse me.

320
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,700
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

321
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,740
l have already given him the best...

322
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,500
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

323
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,710
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

324
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,750
Yes, sir.

325
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,800
-Everything is ready, sir.
-Go ahead.

326
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,850
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening, captain.

327
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
-Won't you join us?
-Thank you.

328
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,860
-lt's a pleasure to have you here, major.
-Champagne and a tin of caviar.

329
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,690
May l recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

330
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,570
-Thank you.
-Very well, sir.

331
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,080
-A very interesting club.
-Especially so tonight, major.

332
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,870
ln a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

333
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,580
l expected no less, captain.

334
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,370
Monsieur Ugarte.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,250
Oh. Yes?

336
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,800
-Will you please come with us?
-Certainly.

337
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,050
May l first please cash my chips?

338
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,810
Very lucky, huh?
Two thousand, please.

339
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,990
Thank you.

340
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,620
Rick! Rick, help me!

341
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,920
-Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
-But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

342
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,930
Excellent, captain.

343
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,770
When they come for me,
l hope you'll be more of a help.

344
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,020
l stick my neck out for nobody.

345
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,060
l'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

346
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,230
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

347
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,860
Okay, boss.

348
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,330
Rick.

349
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,080
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

350
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,120
-How do you do, Mr. Rick?
-How do you do?

351
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,460
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

352
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,130
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

353
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,300
We are very honored tonight.

354
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,640
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

355
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,770
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

356
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,560
Well, personally, major,
l will take what comes.

357
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,770
Do you mind
if l ask you a few questions?

358
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,520
-Unofficially, of course.
-Make it official if you like.

359
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,320
-What is your nationality?
-l'm a drunkard.

360
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,950
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

361
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,780
l was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

362
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,500
l understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

363
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,410
There seems to be no secret
about that.

364
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,040
Are you one of those people...

365
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,000
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

366
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,170
lt's not particularly my beloved Paris.

367
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,260
Can you imagine us in London?

368
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,880
When you get there, ask me.

369
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,510
Diplomatist.

370
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,850
How about New York?

371
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,100
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

372
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,270
...that l wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

373
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,480
Uh-huh.

374
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,310
-Who do you think will win the war?
-l haven't the slightest idea.

375
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,730
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

376
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,150
And that takes in the field
of women too.

377
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,530
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

378
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,610
We have a complete dossier on you.

379
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,620
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

380
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,370
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

381
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,120
And also we know why you left Paris.

382
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,290
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

383
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,710
Are my eyes really brown?

384
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,090
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

385
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,510
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

386
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,680
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

387
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,890
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

388
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,850
ln this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

389
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,520
Not particularly. l understand
the point of view of the hound too.

390
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,690
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

391
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,450
...until the day we marched in.

392
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,950
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

393
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,830
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

394
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,250
l admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

395
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,340
ln Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

396
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,960
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

397
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,010
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

398
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,180
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

399
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,890
Perhaps.

400
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,980
Yes, monsieur?

401
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,020
-l reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
-Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

402
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,930
Two Cointreaux, please.

403
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,430
l saw no one of Ugarte's description.

404
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,720
Victor, l feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

405
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,810
lf we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

406
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,190
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the cafÃ©.

407
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,690
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

408
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,900
Well?

409
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,410
You'll find a market there for this ring.
l'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

410
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,120
-Thank you, but l hardly think....
-Perhaps for the lady.

411
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,790
The ring is quite unique.

412
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,580
-Yes, l'm very interested.
-Good.

413
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,170
What is your name?

414
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,670
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

415
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,050
Victor.

416
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,430
l'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

417
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,180
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

418
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,470
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

419
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,350
l'm sorry, it is.

420
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,350
-Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
-Yes?

421
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
l am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

422
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,900
Yes, what is it you want?

423
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,190
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

424
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,110
lt isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

425
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,740
Thank you.
l hope you'll forgive me, captain.

426
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,450
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

427
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,540
May l present Miss llsa Lund.

428
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,210
l was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

429
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,170
That was a gross understatement.

430
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,670
You're very kind.

431
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,380
-Won't you join us?
-lf you will permit me.

432
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,840
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

433
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,850
-Captain, please.
-lt's a game we play.

434
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,100
They put it on the bill,
l tear up the bill. lt is very convenient.

435
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,770
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano....

436
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,900
Somewhere l've seen him.

437
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,650
Sam?
-Yes.

438
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,570
He came from Paris with Rick.

439
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,190
Rick? Who is he?

440
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,950
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is....

441
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,660
-ls what?
-Mademoiselle...

442
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,450
...he's the kind of man that,
well, if l were a woman...

443
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,120
...and l were not around,
l should be in love with Rick.

444
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,870
But what a fool l am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

445
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,340
Excuse me.

446
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,340
Major.

447
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,010
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may l present Major Strasser.

448
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,220
How do you do?

449
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,390
This is a pleasure
l have looked forward to.

450
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,100
l'm sure you'll excuse me
if l'm not gracious.

451
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,430
You see, Major Strasser,
l am a Czechoslovakian.

452
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,730
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

453
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,360
l have never accepted that privilege.
And l'm now on French soil.

454
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,320
l'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

455
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,120
This is hardly the time or place.

456
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,490
Then we shall state
another time and place.

457
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,740
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

458
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,160
With mademoiselle.

459
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,880
Captain, l am under your authority.

460
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,130
ls it your order
that we come to your office?

461
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,170
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

462
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,180
-Very well.
-Mademoiselle.

463
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,300
Mademoiselle.

464
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,930
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

465
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,190
-This time they really mean to stop me.
-Victor, l'm afraid for you.

466
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,270
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

467
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,520
l must find out what Berger knows.

468
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,900
-Be careful.
-l will. Don't worry.

469
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,920
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could l see it again?

470
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,120
-Yes.
-Monsieur?

471
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,580
Champagne cocktail, please.

472
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,170
l recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

473
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,300
ln a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

474
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,470
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

475
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,510
As you see,
it was true every single time.

476
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,220
Thank heaven l found you, Berger.

477
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,940
l'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

478
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,900
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

479
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,280
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

480
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,030
l see.

481
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,570
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

482
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,950
Underground, like everywhere else.

483
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,960
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

484
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,500
lf you will come--

485
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,330
Monsieur.

486
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,810
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

487
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,100
Very well, mademoiselle.

488
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,610
-How's the jewelry business, Berger?
-Not so good. Check, please.

489
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,320
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

490
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,940
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

491
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,650
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

492
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,280
-My bill.
-No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

493
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,250
Hello, Sam.
-Hello, Miss llsa.

494
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,960
l never expected to see you again.

495
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,250
lt's been a long time.

496
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,460
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

497
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,300
-Some of the old songs, Sam.
-Yes, ma'am.

498
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,400
Where is Rick?

499
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,480
l don't know.
l ain't seen him all night.

500
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,860
-When will he be back?
-Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--

501
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,780
He went home.

502
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,160
-Does he always leave so early?
-Oh, he never--

503
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,700
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

504
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,000
Goes up there all the time.

505
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,250
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

506
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,420
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.

507
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,350
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

508
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,890
l don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.

509
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,020
Play it, Sam.

510
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Play "As Time Goes By."

511
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,570
l can't remember it, Miss llsa.
l'm a little rusty on it.

512
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,490
l'll hum it for you.

513
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,540
Sing it, Sam.

514
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,090
You must remember this

515
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,130
A kiss is just a kiss

516
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,970
A sigh is just a sigh

517
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,230
The fundamental things apply

518
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,980
As time goes by

519
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,400
And when two lovers woo

520
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,320
They still say, "l love you"

521
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,540
On that you can rely

522
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,710
No matter what the future brings

523
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,420
As time goes by

524
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,420
Sam, l thought l told you
never to play--

525
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,060
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May l present--

526
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,560
-Hello, llsa.
-Hello, Rick.

527
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,280
Oh, you've already met Rick,
mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also--

528
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,780
This is Mr. Laszlo.

529
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,360
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

530
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,820
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

531
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,990
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

532
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,330
-Won't you join us for a drink?
-Rick never--

533
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,370
Thanks, l will.
-Well...

534
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,460
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

535
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,790
-lnteresting cafÃ©. l congratulate you.
-l congratulate you.

536
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,460
-What for?
-Your work.

537
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,340
Thank you. l try.

538
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,130
We all try. You succeed.

539
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,640
She was asking about you
earlier, Rick...

540
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,220
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

541
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,640
l wasn't sure you were the same.

542
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,230
-Let's see, the last time we met--
-Was La Belle Aurore.

543
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,730
How nice. You remembered.

544
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,690
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

545
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,650
-Not an easy day to forget.
No.

546
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,580
l remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

547
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,580
Yes. l put that dress away.

548
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,120
When the Germans march out
l'll wear it again.

549
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,420
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
l suppose we have to thank you for that.

550
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,050
llsa, l don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

551
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,930
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

552
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,510
lt would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

553
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,430
l hope we didn't
overstay our welcome.

554
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,640
Not at all.

555
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,520
-Your check, sir.
-lt's my party.

556
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,310
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

557
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,440
l'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

558
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,360
-We'll come again.
-Anytime.

559
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,610
-Say good night to Sam for me.
-l will.

560
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,620
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

561
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,620
He hasn't played it in a long time.

562
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,080
-Good night.
-Good night.

563
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,880
Night.

564
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,260
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

565
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,680
l really can't say,
though l saw him quite often in Paris.

566
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,430
-Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
-We'll be there.

567
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,310
-Good night.
-Good night.

568
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,690
Boss?

569
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,270
-Boss?
-Yeah?

570
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,820
-Boss, ain't you going to bed?
-Not right now.

571
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,700
Ain't you planning to go to bed
in the near future?

572
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,030
No.

573
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,280
-You ever going to bed?
-No.

574
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,950
Well, l ain't sleepy, either.

575
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,290
Good, then have a drink.

576
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,460
-Not me, boss.
-Then don't have a drink.

577
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,170
Boss, let's get out of here.

578
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,920
No, sir. l'm waiting for a lady.

579
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,670
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

580
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,840
She's coming back.
l know she's coming back.

581
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,720
We'll take the car and drive all night.

582
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,760
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

583
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,310
-Shut up and go home, will you?
-No, sir, l'm staying right here.

584
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,320
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

585
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,990
Well, that's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

586
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,490
-Sam.
-Yes, boss?

587
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,120
lf it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

588
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,750
What?

589
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,620
My watch stopped.

590
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,630
l bet they're asleep in New York.

591
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,550
l bet they're asleep all over America.

592
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,520
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

593
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,730
...she walks into mine.

594
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,900
-What's that you're playing?
-A little something of my own.

595
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,860
-Stop it. You know what l want to hear.
-No, l don't.

596
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,200
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

597
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,540
-l don't think l can remember--
-lf she can stand it, l can.

598
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,790
Play it.

599
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,250
Yes, boss.

600
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,760
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

601
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,090
What did you do,
and what did you think?

602
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,600
We said no questions.

603
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,310
Here's looking at you, kid.

604
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,010
A franc for your thoughts.

605
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,600
ln America they'd bring only a penny.

606
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,020
l guess that's about all they're worth.

607
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,860
l'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

608
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,280
Well, l was wondering....

609
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,940
Yes?

610
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,490
Why l'm so lucky. Why l should
find you waiting for me to come along.

611
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,660
-Why there is no other man in my life?
-Uh-huh.

612
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,370
That's easy.
There was.

613
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,880
He's dead.

614
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,710
l'm sorry for asking.

615
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,760
l forgot we said no questions.

616
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,260
Well, only one answer can
take care of all our questions.

617
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,020
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

618
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,110
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

619
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,780
l'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

620
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,620
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date

621
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,830
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate

622
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,210
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate

623
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,930
That no one can deny

624
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,720
lt's still the same old story

625
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,350
A fight for love and glory

626
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,900
A case of do or die

627
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,730
The world will always welcome lovers

628
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,160
As time goes by

629
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,910
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

630
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,000
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

631
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,870
...before he'll let the Germans drink it.

632
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,330
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

633
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,840
You said it.

634
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,920
Here's looking at you, kid.

635
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
My German's a little rusty.

636
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,080
lt's the Gestapo.

637
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,830
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

638
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,500
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

639
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,760
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

640
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,600
lt's pretty bad timing.

641
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,560
-Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
-10 years ago?

642
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,600
Let's see.

643
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,730
Yes, l was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

644
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,900
Looking for a job.

645
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,120
Was that cannon fire?

646
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,540
Or is it my heart pounding?

647
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,790
lt's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

648
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,250
And getting closer every minute.

649
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,590
Here, here, drink up.

650
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,130
We'll never finish the other three.

651
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,760
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

652
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,100
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

653
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,270
l left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

654
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,100
lt's strange.

655
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,690
-l know so very little about you.
-l know very little about you.

656
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,230
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

657
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,410
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

658
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,740
No, we must leave.

659
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,120
Yes, of course. We.

660
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,910
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
l'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

661
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,290
No, no. Not at my hotel. l....

662
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:20,040
l have things to do in the city
before l leave.

663
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,300
l'll meet you at the station.

664
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,670
All right, at a quarter to 5.

665
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,760
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

666
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,140
That's too far ahead to plan.

667
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,100
Yes. l guess it is too far ahead.

668
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,190
Let's see.... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

669
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,400
Oh, darling....

670
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,150
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
lt doesn't seem fair that--

671
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,280
Hey....

672
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,570
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

673
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,830
l love you so much.

674
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,000
And l hate this war so much.

675
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,670
lt's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

676
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,260
lf you shouldn't get away....

677
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,800
l mean if--

678
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,350
lf something should keep us apart...

679
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,180
...wherever they put you...

680
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,600
...and wherever l'll be,
l want you to know that l....

681
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,440
Kiss me.

682
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,780
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

683
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,520
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

684
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,240
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

685
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,950
l can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

686
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,240
But this note came just after you left.

687
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,090
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

688
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,340
Do you hear me?

689
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,970
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

690
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,530
-Rick, l have to talk to you.
-Uh-huh.

691
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,150
l saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

692
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,450
-No, Rick. Not tonight.
-Especially tonight.

693
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,450
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

694
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,000
l wouldn't have come
if l'd known you were here.

695
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,710
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
l didn't know.

696
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,300
lt's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. l can still hear it.

697
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,550
"Richard, dear,
l'll go with you anyplace.

698
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,390
-We'll get on a train and never stop."
-Don't, Rick.

699
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,100
l can understand how you feel.

700
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,100
You understand how l feel.

701
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,560
How long was it we had, honey?

702
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,690
-l didn't count the days.
-Well, l did.

703
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,440
Every one of them.

704
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,030
Mostly l remember the last one.

705
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,780
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

706
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,700
...with a comical look on his face...

707
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,870
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

708
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,040
Can l tell you a story, Rick?

709
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,710
Does it got a wild finish?

710
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,040
l don't know the finish yet.

711
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,630
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

712
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,890
lt's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

713
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,760
At the house of some friends...

714
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,810
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

715
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,190
A very great and courageous man.

716
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,860
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

717
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,610
...full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

718
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,910
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

719
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,820
And she looked up to him...

720
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,580
...and worshiped him...

721
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,580
...with a feeling
she supposed was love.

722
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,870
Yes, that's very pretty.

723
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,750
l heard a story once. ln fact,
l've heard a lot of stories in my time.

724
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,710
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

725
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,220
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

726
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,720
"Mister, l met a man once
when l was a kid," they'd always begin.

727
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,770
l guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

728
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,060
Tell me...

729
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,110
...who was it you left me for?

730
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,110
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

731
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,150
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

732
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,060
l strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

733
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,600
l would suggest you search
the cafÃ© immediately.

734
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,810
lf Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

735
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,110
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

736
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,860
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

737
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,110
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

738
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,200
l was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

739
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:27,290
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

740
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,290
lt may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

741
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,010
There is nothing we can do.

742
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,640
l'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

743
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,840
l slept very well.

744
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,640
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

745
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,180
-May we proceed?
-With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

746
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,270
Thank you.

747
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,360
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

748
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,860
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

749
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,860
You have reached Casablanca.

750
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,780
lt is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

751
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,120
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

752
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,040
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

753
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,920
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

754
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,420
l'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

755
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,710
Well, perhaps l shall like it
in Casablanca.

756
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,010
And mademoiselle?

757
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,720
-You needn't be concerned about me.
-ls that all you wish to tell us?

758
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,800
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

759
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,640
You may be
in Casablanca indefinitely.

760
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,730
Or you may leave
for Lisbon tomorrow.

761
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,100
-On one condition.
-And that is?

762
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,570
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

763
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,110
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

764
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,570
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens....

765
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,360
-Even Berlin.
-Yes, even in Berlin.

766
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,160
lf you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

767
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,080
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

768
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,040
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

769
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,920
l was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

770
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,880
-That's honor enough for a lifetime.
-You will give us the names?

771
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,920
lf l didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

772
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,050
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

773
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,850
...l certainly won't
give them to you now.

774
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,680
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

775
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,430
What if you murdered all of us?

776
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,940
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

777
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,440
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

778
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,150
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which l can now understand.

779
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,950
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

780
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,660
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

781
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,370
But there is one exception.

782
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,160
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

783
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,250
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

784
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,960
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

785
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,670
This is still unoccupied France.

786
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,960
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

787
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,840
-Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
-Thank you.

788
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:51,140
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

789
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,640
-Yes?
-l believe you have a message for him?

790
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,060
Nothing important.
But may l speak to him now?

791
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,650
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

792
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,650
Signor Ugarte is dead.

793
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,780
l'm making out the report now.

794
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,540
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

795
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,080
...or died trying to escape.

796
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,420
-Are you quite finished with us?
-For the time being.

797
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,130
Good day.

798
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,140
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

799
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,350
Excuse me, captain.

800
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,560
Another visa problem has come up.

801
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,940
-Show her in.
-Yes, sir.

802
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,660
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

803
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,570
-This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
-Ferrari?

804
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,950
lt can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

805
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,750
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

806
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,040
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

807
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,380
Thanks.

808
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,600
Don't be too downhearted.

809
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,890
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

810
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,390
Thank you very much, signor.

811
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,980
Hello, Ferrari.
-Good morning, Rick.

812
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,320
The bus is in.
l'll take my shipment with me.

813
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,570
l'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

814
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,030
l never drink in the morning.

815
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,950
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

816
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,070
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

817
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,580
Here, sit down.

818
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,410
There is something l want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

819
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,200
Bourbon.

820
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,420
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

821
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,750
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than l do.

822
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,960
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

823
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,170
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

824
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,630
Practically no one.

825
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,090
lf l had those letters,
l could make a fortune.

826
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,430
So could l,
and l'm a poor businessman.

827
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,930
l have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

828
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,640
l'll handle the entire transaction.

829
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,520
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

830
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,230
And the carrying charges?

831
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,150
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

832
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,280
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

833
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,990
l'll tell him when he comes in.

834
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,780
Rick, l think you know
where those letters are.

835
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,290
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

836
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,000
That's why l came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

837
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:31,510
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

838
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,630
Excuse me, l'll be getting back.

839
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,220
Morning.

840
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,970
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

841
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,270
You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

842
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,780
Only 700 francs.

843
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,150
-You're being cheated.
-Doesn't matter, thank you.

844
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,450
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

845
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,160
Did l say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

846
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:02,960
l'm sorry l was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

847
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,160
Doesn't matter.

848
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:08,290
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

849
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,510
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

850
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,300
l have some tablecloths, napkins--

851
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,180
-Thank you. l'm really not interested.
-Please, one minute.

852
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,970
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

853
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,180
Yes.

854
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,680
Well, you can tell me now.
l'm reasonably sober.

855
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,480
l don't think l will, Rick.

856
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,190
Why not? After all, l got stuck with
a railway ticket.

857
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,940
l think l'm entitled to know.

858
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,320
Last night l saw
what has happened to you.

859
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,200
The Rick l knew in Paris,
l could tell him, he'd understand.

860
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,950
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred....

861
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,540
l'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

862
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,710
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

863
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,170
lf we leave it that way...

864
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,710
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

865
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,300
Not last night.

866
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,220
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

867
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,260
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

868
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,140
You can believe that if you want to.

869
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,060
Well, l'm not running away anymore.
l'm settled now.

870
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,060
Above a saloon, it's true...

871
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,690
...but walk up a flight...

872
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,570
...l'll be expecting you.

873
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,450
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

874
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,360
You'll be there.

875
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:21,910
No, Rick.

876
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,580
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

877
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,210
And was,
even when l knew you in Paris.

878
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,340
l was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately l'm not able to help him.

879
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,430
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

880
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,350
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

881
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,180
...l am influential and respected.

882
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,770
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

883
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,770
You, however, are a different matter.

884
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,610
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

885
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,160
-You mean for me to go on alone?
-And only alone.

886
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,620
l'll stay here and keep on trying.
l'm sure in a little while--

887
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,620
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

888
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:09,250
lt would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

889
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,830
We are only interested in two visas.

890
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,290
-Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
-No, Victor.

891
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,710
You two will want to discuss this.

892
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,840
Excuse me. l'll be at the bar.

893
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,510
No, llsa.
l won't let you stay here.

894
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,060
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow l will get out and join you.

895
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,100
But if the situation were different...

896
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,810
...if l had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

897
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,310
...would you take it?

898
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,610
Yes, l would.

899
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,990
Yes, l see.

900
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:44,070
When l had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

901
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,410
When l was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

902
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,290
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

903
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,080
l meant to,
but something always held me up.

904
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,010
l love you very much, llsa.

905
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,340
Your secret will be safe with me.

906
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,510
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

907
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,010
Not more than 50 francs.

908
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,520
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

909
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,070
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

910
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,190
Well, good luck, but be careful.

911
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,200
-You know you're being shadowed?
-Of course. lt becomes an instinct.

912
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,570
l observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

913
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,490
l am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, l do not know.

914
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,540
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

915
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,870
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

916
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,080
Yes, something.

917
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,460
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

918
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,630
-You know where they are?
-Not for sure.

919
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,880
But l'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

920
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:45,590
Rick?

921
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,970
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

922
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,810
But it is worth a chance.

923
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,190
Thank you very much.
Good day.

924
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,610
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

925
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,610
l shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

926
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,230
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

927
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,740
-Monsieur.
-Good day.

928
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,790
-Here's to you, sir.
-Good luck.

929
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,130
-l'd better be going.
-My check, please.

930
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,090
l have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

931
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,550
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

932
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,930
-Goodbye.
-lt has been a pleasure to meet you.

933
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,760
l'm sorry.

934
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,280
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

935
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,700
Well, drinking.
l'm very pleased with you.

936
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,790
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

937
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,290
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

938
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,460
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

939
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,920
l told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

940
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,210
But l told my men
to be especially destructive.

941
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,300
You know how
that impresses Germans.

942
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,970
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

943
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,430
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

944
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:16,520
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

945
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,310
-lt looks like you're a little late.
-Huh?

946
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,280
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

947
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:32,200
Who knows? ln her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

948
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,120
l think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. l'll see you later.

949
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,370
Sascha!

950
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,580
French 75s.

951
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,460
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

952
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,960
We will begin with two.

953
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,220
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

954
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:59,810
-What l said is none of your business.
-l'll make it my business.

955
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,650
l don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

956
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,580
You see, captain?

957
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,210
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

958
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,290
We try to cooperate
with your government.

959
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,750
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

960
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,090
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

961
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,550
l have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

962
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,050
l blow with the wind...

963
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,640
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

964
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,550
And if it should change?

965
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,970
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

966
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,230
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

967
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,850
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

968
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,070
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

969
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,440
A leader? Like Laszlo?

970
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,740
Mm-hm. l have been thinking.

971
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:52,410
lt's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

972
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,370
l see what you mean.

973
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,330
Thank you, Carl.

974
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,750
Thank you, Carl.

975
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,920
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

976
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,670
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

977
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,920
Thank you very much.

978
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,880
l thought you would ask me,
so l brought the good brandy...

979
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,930
...and a third glass.

980
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
At last the day's came!

981
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,100
Frau Leuchtag and l
are speaking nothing but English now.

982
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:23,100
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

983
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,940
A very nice idea.

984
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,280
-To America.
-To America.

985
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,440
To America.

986
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,280
What watch?

987
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,120
-Ten watch.
-Such much?

988
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,130
You will get along beautifully
in America.

989
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,880
How is lady luck treating you?

990
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,920
Oh, too bad.

991
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,130
You'll find him over there.

992
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,890
-Monsieur Rick?
-Yes?

993
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,350
-Could l speak to you, please?
-How'd you get in? You're underage.

994
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,810
-l came with Captain Renault.
-l should have known.

995
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,310
My husband is with me too.

996
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,190
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

997
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,400
Have a drink?

998
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:14,280
-No, of course not. You mind if l do?
-Oh, no.

999
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,490
Monsieur Rick,
what kind of a man is Captain Renault?

1000
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,200
Like any other man, only more so.

1001
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:21,410
No, l mean...

1002
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,410
...is he trustworthy?
ls his word--?

1003
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,080
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

1004
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,710
He did. Captain Renault did.

1005
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,960
l thought so. Where's your husband?

1006
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,510
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

1007
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,470
Oh, of course he's losing.

1008
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,600
-How long have you been married?
-Eight weeks.

1009
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,270
We come from Bulgaria.

1010
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,100
Things are very bad there.

1011
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,480
The devil has the people
by the throat.

1012
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,400
So Jan and l, we....

1013
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,280
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

1014
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,860
-So you decided to go to America.
-Yes.

1015
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,410
But we haven't much money...

1016
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,030
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

1017
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,500
lt was much more than we thought
to get here.

1018
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,290
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

1019
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,790
Yes, l'll bet.

1020
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,550
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

1021
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,380
But we have no money.

1022
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,260
-Does he know that?
-Yes.

1023
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,760
-And he's still willing to give you a visa?
-Yes.

1024
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:21,890
-And you want to know...?
-Will he keep his word?

1025
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,100
He always has.

1026
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,690
Oh....

1027
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,020
Monsieur...

1028
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,310
...you are a man.

1029
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,150
lf someone loved you very much...

1030
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,570
...so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

1031
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,030
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

1032
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,620
-...could you forgive her?
-Nobody ever loved me that much.

1033
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:49,620
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

1034
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,580
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

1035
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,920
-You want my advice?
-Yes, please.

1036
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,510
Go back to Bulgaria.

1037
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,970
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America....

1038
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:05,310
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

1039
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:08,940
ln many ways
l am so much older than he is.

1040
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,480
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

1041
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:14,820
-Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
-Thank you, monsieur.

1042
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:24,830
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1043
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,290
You see? Here we are again.

1044
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,540
l take that
as a great compliment to Sam.

1045
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,960
l suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

1046
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,670
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

1047
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,210
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

1048
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,050
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

1049
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,970
-Paul, table 30.
-Yes, sir.

1050
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,970
Right this way, if you please.

1051
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,890
l'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
l believe that's your favorite tune.

1052
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,390
Thank you.

1053
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,450
-Two cognacs, please.
-Cognac.

1054
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:28,100
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1055
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,350
No. No, l guess not.

1056
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,390
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1057
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,360
l said 22.

1058
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,040
Leave it there.

1059
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,890
Cash it in and don't come back.

1060
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,690
Are you sure this place is honest?

1061
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:19,070
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1062
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,360
How are we doing tonight?

1063
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,360
A couple of thousand less
than l thought there would be.

1064
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,040
Monsieur Rick....

1065
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,580
l-- Oh....

1066
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,710
He's just a lucky guy.

1067
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,300
Monsieur Rick,
may l get you a cup of coffee?

1068
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,550
-No, thanks, Carl.
-Monsieur Rick....

1069
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,560
Captain Renault, may l--?

1070
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,060
Not here.
Come to my office in the morning.

1071
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,890
We'll do everything businesslike.

1072
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,610
-We'll be there at 6.
-l'll be there at 10.

1073
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,610
l'm very happy for both of you.

1074
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,900
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1075
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,320
Well, maybe not so strange.

1076
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:08,320
-l'll see you in the morning.
-Thank you, Captain Renault.

1077
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,330
No!

1078
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,960
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1079
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,130
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1080
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,970
As l suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.

1081
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,180
Yeah? Why?

1082
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,230
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

1083
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,270
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1084
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,980
Well, l'll forgive you this time.

1085
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,980
But l'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

1086
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,360
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

1087
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,570
Mm-hm.

1088
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,700
Mr. Blaine,
l wonder if l could talk to you.

1089
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,370
-Go ahead.
-Well, isn't there some other place?

1090
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,080
lt's rather confidential,
what l have to say.

1091
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,290
-ln my office.
-Right.

1092
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,010
You must know it's very important
l get out of Casablanca.

1093
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,180
lt's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

1094
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,140
You know what l've been doing.

1095
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,220
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1096
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,690
...that l reach America
and continue my work.

1097
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,270
l'm not interested in politics.

1098
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,940
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

1099
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,320
l'm a saloonkeeper.

1100
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,190
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

1101
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,900
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1102
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,740
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

1103
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:32,950
What of it?

1104
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,290
lsn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

1105
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,410
Yes, l found that
a very expensive hobby.

1106
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,870
But then l never was
much of a businessman.

1107
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,380
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1108
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,420
-l appreciate it, but l don't accept it.
-200,000.

1109
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,340
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1110
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,340
My answer would still be the same.

1111
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,680
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1112
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,010
There is.

1113
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,600
l suggest that you ask your wife.

1114
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,560
-l beg your pardon?
-l said, ask your wife.

1115
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,310
-My wife?
-Yes.

1116
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:46,730
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1117
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,460
Vive la France!

1118
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,770
See what l mean? lf Laszlo's presence in
a cafÃ© can inspire this demonstration...

1119
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,400
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1120
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,570
l advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1121
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,820
-But everybody's having a good time.
-Yes, much too good a time.

1122
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,200
The place is to be closed.

1123
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,410
-But l have no excuse to close it.
-Find one.

1124
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,960
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1125
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,420
This cafÃ© is closed until further notice.

1126
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,250
Clear the room at once.

1127
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,050
How can you close me up?

1128
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,720
l'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1129
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,800
-Your winnings, sir.
-Thank you.

1130
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,220
Everybody out at once.

1131
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,610
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1132
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:53,570
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1133
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:56,690
That is also true, except for one
destination: occupied France.

1134
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,780
-Occupied France?
-Under safe conduct from me.

1135
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,030
Of what value is that?

1136
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,240
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1137
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,660
-There are two other alternatives for him.
-What are they?

1138
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:09,790
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1139
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,130
...to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1140
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,420
The other alternative?

1141
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,880
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1142
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,340
...that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1143
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:19,840
Good night, mademoiselle.

1144
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,070
-What happened with Rick?
-We'll discuss it later.

1145
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,970
Our faithful friend is still there.

1146
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:02,050
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1147
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,390
l must.

1148
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:07,010
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1149
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,520
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, l'm frightened.

1150
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,560
Tell you the truth,
l'm frightened too.

1151
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,150
Shall l remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1152
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,980
Or shall l carry on the best l can?

1153
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,070
Whatever l'd say,
you would carry on.

1154
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,860
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1155
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,410
-Apparently he has the letters.
-Yes?

1156
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,160
But no intention of selling them.

1157
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:32,000
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1158
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,750
Did he give any reason?

1159
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,210
-He suggested l ask you.
-Ask me?

1160
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,590
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1161
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:42,340
l don't know why he said that.

1162
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,610
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1163
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,820
l'll be going in a few minutes.

1164
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,360
-llsa, l....
-Yes?

1165
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,910
When l was
in the concentration camp...

1166
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,040
...were you lonely in Paris?

1167
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Yes, Victor, l was.

1168
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:19,420
l know how it is to be lonely.

1169
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,840
ls there anything you wish to tell me?

1170
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
No, Victor, there isn't.

1171
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,020
l love you very much, my dear.

1172
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,850
Yes.

1173
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
Yes, l know.

1174
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,610
Victor, whatever l do,
will you believe that l...?

1175
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,490
You don't even have to say it.

1176
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,410
l'll believe.

1177
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:50,870
Good night, dear.

1178
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,210
Good night.

1179
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,920
-Victor.
-Yes, dear?

1180
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,600
Be careful.

1181
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,770
Of course l'll be careful.

1182
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,310
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1183
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,270
How long can l afford to stay closed?

1184
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,230
Two weeks, maybe three.

1185
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,650
Maybe l won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1186
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,110
ln the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1187
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,660
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1188
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:14,160
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
l owe him money.

1189
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,580
-You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-l will.

1190
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,880
-Then l am going to the meeting--
-Don't tell me where you're going.

1191
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,250
l won't.

1192
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,500
Good night.

1193
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,210
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1194
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,280
-How did you get in?
-The stairs from the street.

1195
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,780
l told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1196
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,200
Well, won't you sit down?

1197
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:56,290
-Richard, l had to see you.
-"Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1198
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,750
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1199
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,670
Seems as long as l have those letters
l'll never be lonely.

1200
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,460
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1201
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:08,210
l went all through that
with your husband. lt's no deal.

1202
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,510
l know how you feel about me...

1203
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,430
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1204
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,060
l have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1205
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,220
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1206
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,730
lt was your cause too.

1207
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,390
ln your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1208
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:25,560
l'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1209
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,780
l'm the only cause l'm interested in.

1210
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,160
Richard.

1211
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:37,910
We loved each other once. lf those
days meant anything at all to you--

1212
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,000
l wouldn't bring up Paris if l were you.
lt's poor salesmanship.

1213
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,630
Listen to me. lf you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1214
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,880
l wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1215
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,090
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1216
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,050
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1217
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,970
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1218
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,810
One woman has hurt you...

1219
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,730
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1220
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,440
You're a coward and a weakling.

1221
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,700
No. Oh, Richard. l'm sorry.

1222
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,740
l'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1223
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,620
lf you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1224
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:21,830
What of it?

1225
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,670
l'm going to die in Casablanca.
lt's a good spot for it.

1226
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,340
Now, if you'll--

1227
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,010
All right.

1228
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,220
l tried to reason with you.

1229
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:41,640
l tried everything.
Now, l want those letters.

1230
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,140
-Get them for me.
-l don't have to. l got them right here.

1231
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,610
Put them on the table.

1232
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,480
No.

1233
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,700
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1234
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:59,990
lf Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1235
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,410
All right,
l'll make it easier for you.

1236
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:09,540
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1237
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,340
Richard...

1238
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,890
...l tried to stay away.

1239
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,930
l thought l would never see you again.

1240
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:25,520
That you were out of my life.

1241
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:47,830
The day you left Paris...

1242
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,380
...if you knew what l went through.

1243
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,710
lf you knew how much l loved you.

1244
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,550
How much l still love you.

1245
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,480
And then?

1246
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:20,860
lt wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1247
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:24,580
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1248
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,450
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1249
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,250
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1250
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,750
l was frantic.
For months l tried to get word.

1251
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,250
Then it came.

1252
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,630
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1253
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,430
l was lonely.
l had nothing, not even hope.

1254
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,260
Then l met you.

1255
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,930
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1256
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,230
lt wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1257
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,940
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1258
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,360
That was his way of protecting me.
l knew so much about his work.

1259
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:59,860
lf the Gestapo found out l was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1260
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:01,570
...and for those working with us.

1261
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,530
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1262
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:08,120
Just before you and l
were to leave Paris together.

1263
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,710
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1264
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:14,000
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1265
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,340
He was sick. He needed me.

1266
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,550
l wanted to tell you,
but l didn't dare.

1267
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,680
l knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1268
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,470
Well...

1269
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,480
...well, you know the rest.

1270
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,480
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1271
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,820
What about now?

1272
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,030
Now?

1273
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,360
l don't know.

1274
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:45,070
l know that l'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1275
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,330
And Laszlo?

1276
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,950
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1277
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,460
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1278
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,130
All except one.

1279
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,000
He won't have you.

1280
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,930
l can't fight it anymore.

1281
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,010
l ran away from you once.
l can't do it again.

1282
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,060
Oh, l don't know
what's right any longer.

1283
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:15,310
You have to think for both of us.

1284
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:17,690
For all of us.

1285
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,990
All right. l will.

1286
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,830
Here's looking at you, kid.

1287
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,710
l wish l didn't love you so much.

1288
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,180
-l think we lost them.
-Yes.

1289
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,310
l'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1290
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,520
Come inside.

1291
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:01,690
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
l will help you immediately.

1292
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,690
Thank you.

1293
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,300
Carl, what happened?

1294
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,470
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1295
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,090
We escaped at the last moment.

1296
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,600
-Come up here a minute.
-Yes, l come.

1297
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,100
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
lt might attract the police.

1298
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,980
-But Sascha always puts out that light.
-Tonight he forgot.

1299
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,940
Yes, l come. l will do it.

1300
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:50,120
-l want you to take Miss Lund home.
-Yes, sir.

1301
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:04,210
lt's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1302
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,130
This might come in handy.

1303
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,470
Thank you.

1304
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,300
-Had a close one, eh?
-Yes, rather.

1305
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,060
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1306
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,140
l mean, what you're fighting for.

1307
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,270
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1308
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,980
lf we stop breathing, we'll die.

1309
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,610
lf we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1310
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,030
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1311
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,360
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1312
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,740
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1313
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,160
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1314
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:37,500
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1315
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,540
-l get the point.
-l wonder if you do.

1316
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,000
l wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1317
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,750
...and that you'll never succeed.

1318
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,170
You seem to know
all about my destiny.

1319
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,550
l know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1320
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,140
l know that you're in love
with a woman.

1321
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:57,100
lt's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1322
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:00,190
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1323
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,520
The first evening
l came into this cafÃ©...

1324
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,020
...l knew there was something
between you and llsa.

1325
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,530
Since no one is to blame...

1326
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,950
...l demand no explanation.

1327
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:13,410
l ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1328
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:15,160
All right.

1329
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,240
But l want my wife to be safe.

1330
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:18,950
l ask you as a favor...

1331
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,040
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1332
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,330
You love her that much?

1333
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,300
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1334
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,460
Well, l am also a human being.

1335
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,800
Yes, l love her that much.

1336
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,890
-Monsieur Laszlo?
-Yes?

1337
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,560
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1338
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:44,770
On what charge?

1339
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,150
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1340
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,070
lt seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1341
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:06,000
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1342
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,460
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1343
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:10,260
You might as well let him go now.

1344
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,430
l'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1345
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,090
lf you were to help him escape--

1346
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,680
What makes you think
l'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1347
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,310
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1348
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,600
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1349
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,860
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1350
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,900
As a matter of fact,
l don't either.

1351
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,440
They're all excellent reasons.

1352
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:32,570
Don't count too much
on my friendship.

1353
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:36,200
ln this matter l'm powerless.
Besides, l might lose the 10,000 francs.

1354
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:41,120
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. l get the point.

1355
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:42,790
Yes, l have the letters.

1356
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,790
But l intend using them myself.

1357
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:48,710
l'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1358
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,960
And l'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1359
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:54,090
-What friend?
-llsa Lund.

1360
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,840
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1361
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:00,060
The last man l want to see in America.

1362
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:03,480
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1363
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,810
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1364
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,650
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1365
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,030
l'm not. But l am interested
in what happens to llsa and me.

1366
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,240
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1367
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,490
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1368
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,280
...in spite of their legal rights.

1369
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,290
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1370
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,500
llsa is Laszlo's wife.

1371
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,330
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1372
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,040
Louis, l'll make a deal with you.

1373
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:31,750
lnstead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1374
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,170
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years....

1375
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,970
-Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
-Certainly.

1376
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,300
Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.

1377
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,510
Then release him.

1378
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,350
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1379
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,020
l'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1380
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:49,860
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1381
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:52,400
You get him, and we get away.

1382
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,490
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1383
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,490
There's still something about this
l don't quite understand.

1384
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,370
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1385
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,870
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1386
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,710
-She isn't just any woman.
-l see.

1387
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,710
How do l know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1388
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,710
l'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1389
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,090
l'm gonna miss you.

1390
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,380
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than l.

1391
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:18,880
Oh, thanks.

1392
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,640
Go ahead, Ricky.

1393
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,510
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1394
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,560
l don't want them around
this afternoon.

1395
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,730
l'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1396
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,900
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1397
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:41,320
Certainly not good enough.
But since l'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1398
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,950
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America.... You're a lucky man.

1399
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:50,580
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1400
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:53,540
l happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1401
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,670
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or l don't sell.

1402
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,300
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1403
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,800
Well, so long.

1404
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:04,010
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1405
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,680
l shall remember to pay it to myself.

1406
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,510
You're late.

1407
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,850
l was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so l knew l'd be on time.

1408
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:49,060
-l asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
-He won't be followed here.

1409
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,310
This place will never be
the same without you.

1410
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,060
l know what you mean. But l've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1411
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,980
-ls everything ready?
-l have the letters right here.

1412
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,320
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1413
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:01,650
Sam's piano.

1414
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,320
Serves me right for not being musical.

1415
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,660
Here they are.

1416
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,870
You better wait in my office.

1417
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,420
Here.

1418
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:20,130
Victor thinks l'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1419
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,340
Not yet.

1420
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,090
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1421
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,340
Everything is quite all right.

1422
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:27,510
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1423
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,510
Please trust me.

1424
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,810
Yes, l will.

1425
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:42,110
-l don't know how to thank you.
-Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1426
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,030
l brought the money.
-Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1427
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,330
-But we made a deal.
-Never mind that.

1428
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,790
-You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
-No. lt's all arranged.

1429
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,290
Good. l've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1430
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,880
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1431
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,460
Victor Laszlo.

1432
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,710
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1433
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,010
The charge of
accessory to the murder...

1434
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,350
...of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1435
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:13,180
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1436
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,350
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--

1437
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:21,570
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1438
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,740
-Have you lost your mind?
-l have. Sit down.

1439
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,070
-Put that gun down.
-l don't want to shoot you...

1440
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,070
...but l will if you take one more step.

1441
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,030
Under the circumstances,
l will sit down.

1442
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:37,750
-Keep your hands on the table.
-l wonder if you realize what this means.

1443
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,090
l do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1444
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,840
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1445
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,630
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1446
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,220
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1447
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,470
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1448
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,980
-Hello? ls that the airport?
-Huh?

1449
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,070
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1450
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:04,820
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1451
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,780
There's to be no trouble about them.

1452
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,240
Good.

1453
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,160
Hello? Hello?

1454
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,000
My car, quickly!

1455
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,120
This is Major Strasser.

1456
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:21,750
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1457
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,210
At once, do you hear?

1458
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,390
Hello, radio tower?

1459
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,640
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1460
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:38,390
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1461
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,480
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1462
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:45,400
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1463
01:35:57,910 --> 01:36:00,670
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1464
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:02,580
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1465
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,920
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1466
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,130
Yes, sir.

1467
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,340
This way, please.

1468
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:12,340
lf you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1469
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:14,550
You think of everything, don't you?

1470
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,180
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1471
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,940
-But why my name, Richard?
-Because you're getting on that plane.

1472
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,690
l don't understand.
What about you?

1473
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,980
l'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1474
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:27,150
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

1475
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,110
Last night
we said a great many things.

1476
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,200
You said
l was to do the thinking for us.

1477
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,700
l've done a lot of it since then.
lt adds up to one thing:

1478
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:36,160
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1479
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,870
-Richard, no--
-Now, you've got to listen to me.

1480
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,920
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1481
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,380
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1482
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,840
l'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1483
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:51,420
-You're saying this only to make me go.
-l'm saying it because it's true.

1484
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:53,890
lnside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1485
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,390
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1486
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,430
lf that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1487
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,140
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1488
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:06,110
But what about us?

1489
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,690
We'll always have Paris.

1490
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,860
We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1491
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,900
We got it back last night.

1492
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:17,580
-When l said l would never leave you.
-And you never will.

1493
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,580
But l've got a job to do too.

1494
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,250
Where l'm going, you can't follow.

1495
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,540
What l've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1496
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,670
llsa, l'm no good at being noble.

1497
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,300
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1498
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:32,170
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1499
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,880
Someday you'll understand that.

1500
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,800
Now, now.

1501
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,770
Here's looking at you, kid.

1502
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:59,410
-Everything is in order.
-All except one thing.

1503
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:01,790
There's something you should know.

1504
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,790
l don't ask you to explain anything.

1505
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,080
l'm going to anyway.
lt may make a difference to you later on.

1506
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,130
-You said you knew about llsa and me.
-Yes.

1507
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,130
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1508
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,760
She came there for the letters of transit.
lsn't that true, llsa?

1509
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,430
Yes.

1510
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,640
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1511
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,310
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1512
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,020
But that was all over long ago.

1513
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,480
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and l let her pretend.

1514
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,610
l understand.

1515
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,990
-Here it is.
-Thanks.

1516
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,490
l appreciate it.

1517
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,120
Welcome back to the fight.

1518
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,830
This time l know our side will win.

1519
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:57,720
Are you ready, llsa?

1520
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,970
Yes, l'm ready.

1521
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,480
Goodbye, Rick.

1522
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:08,230
God bless you.

1523
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,270
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1524
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:32,250
l was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1525
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:35,250
Stay where you are.
l don't know what you're talking about.

1526
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,760
What you just did for Laszlo.

1527
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,340
That fairy tale you invented
to send llsa away with him.

1528
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:41,840
l know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1529
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:44,060
But she knew you were lying.

1530
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,180
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1531
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:49,600
l suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1532
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,940
Especially for you.

1533
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,320
-l'll have to arrest you, of course.
-As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1534
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,240
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1535
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:05,700
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1536
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,370
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1537
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,580
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1538
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,710
-Get away from that phone.
-l advise you not to interfere.

1539
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,180
l was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and l'm willing to shoot you.

1540
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:24,720
-Hello!
-Put that phone down.

1541
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,760
-Get me the radio tower.
-Put it down!

1542
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:43,360
Major Strasser has been shot.

1543
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,790
Round up the usual suspects.

1544
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,610
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1545
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,400
...but you've become a patriot.

1546
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:20,740
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1547
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,900
l think perhaps you're right.

1548
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,390
lt might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1549
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,020
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1550
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:57,980
-l could be induced to arrange a passage.
-My letter of transit?

1551
01:41:58,190 --> 01:41:59,440
l could use a trip.

1552
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:02,900
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1553
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:06,030
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1554
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,120
"Our" expenses?
-Mm-hm.

1555
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:12,500
Louis, l think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
