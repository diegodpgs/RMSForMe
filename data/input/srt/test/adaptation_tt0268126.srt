1
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:26,946
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

2
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,970
Maybe if I were happier,
my hair wouldn't be falling out.

3
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:33,671
Life is short. I need
to make the most of it.

4
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:37,269
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

5
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,667
I'm a walking cliche.

6
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,483
I really need to go to the doctor
and have my leg check ed.

7
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:44,255
There's something wrong.
A bump.

8
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:46,827
The dentist called again.
I'm way overdue.

9
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:49,261
If I stopped putting things off,
I'd be happier.

10
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,109
All I do is sit on my fat ass.
If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

11
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:57,394
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts
with the tails out all the time.

12
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:59,062
Like that's fooling anyone.

13
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:03,129
Fat ass. I should start jogging again.
Five miles a day.

14
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,257
Really do it this time.
Maybe rock climbing.

15
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,099
I need to turn my life around.

16
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,949
What do I need to do?
I need to fall in love.

17
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:12,513
I need to have a girlfriend.

18
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,912
I need to read more,
improve myself.

19
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,858
What if I learned Russian
or something?

20
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:20,021
Or took up an instrument?
I could speak Chinese.

21
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,671
I would be the screenwriter who
speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

22
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:26,486
That would be cool.
I should get my hair cut short.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,823
Stop trying to fool everyone
into thinking I have a full head of hair.

24
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:33,055
How pathetic is that?
Just be real. Confident.

25
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,349
Isn't that what women
are attracted to?

26
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,087
Men don't have to be attractive.

27
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:39,694
But that's not true,
especially these days.

28
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,961
Almost as much pressure on men
as there is on women these days.

29
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,194
Why should I be made to feel I have
to apologize for my existence?

30
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,966
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,434
Maybe that's what's wrong with me.:
Bad chemistry.

32
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,597
All my problems and anxiety can be
reduced to a chemical imbalance...

33
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,682
or some kind of
misfiring synapses.

34
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:57,664
I need to get help for that.

35
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,958
But I'll still be ugly, though.

36
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,834
Nothing's gonna change that.

37
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,981
Shut up!

38
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:09,238
Let's really try today
to solve our camera problems.

39
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,783
Keep between-take time
at an absolute minimum.

40
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:15,146
These masks are really hot. Okay?

41
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,962
I wanna be very well-heard
on that from everybody.

42
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:22,220
Don't futz unless it's absolutely
important to the shot, okay?

43
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:26,443
I don't say that for me.
I say that for the people sitting here...

44
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,216
- Thank you, John.
- In the rubber.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,927
- I like my dress. Okay?
- Very good.

46
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,576
So now, folks, you better
heed that advice.

47
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:37,913
Stand by for picture.

48
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,292
Have her rotate around the table
a little bit further.

49
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:46,568
Hold on until we're clear.

50
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,800
You. You're in the eyeline.
Can you please get off the stage?

51
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,198
Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.

52
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,123
What am I doing here?
Why did I bother to come here today?

53
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,313
Nobody even seems to know
my name.

54
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:07,631
I've been on this planet for 40 years,
and I don't understand a single thing.

55
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,655
Why am I here?
How did I get here?

56
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,847
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

57
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,488
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat.
Stop sweating.

58
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,782
I've got to stop sweating.

59
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,702
Can she see it dripping
down my forehead?

60
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:20,622
She looked at my hairline.
She thinks I'm bald. She...

61
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:23,229
We think you're great.

62
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,105
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

63
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,921
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

64
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:30,597
- Thanks. Thanks...
- Such a unique voice.

65
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:33,447
Boy, I'd love to find
a portal into your brain.

66
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,429
Trust me, it's no fun.

67
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:40,642
So tell me your thoughts
on this crazy little project of ours.

68
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,396
First, I think it's a great book.

69
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,046
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
- Absolutely.

70
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,452
And Orlean makes orchids
so fascinating.

71
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:55,205
Plus, her musings on Florida
and orchid poaching...

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,681
Indians. It's just-it's great,
sprawling New Yorker stuff.

73
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,350
I'd want to remain true to that.

74
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:04,625
I'd wanna let the movie exist,
rather than be...

75
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,170
- Artificially plot-driven.
- Great.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,090
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what that means.

77
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,790
I'm not sure I know
what that means either.

78
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,953
I just don't wanna ruin it by making
it a Hollywood thing. You know?

79
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:24,958
Like... an orchid heist movie
or something, you know?

80
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:27,530
Or changing the orchids
into poppies...

81
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:29,650
and making it about drug running,
you know?

82
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,736
- Definitely.
- Why can't there be a movie...

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,821
simply about flowers?

84
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,324
I guess we thought that maybe...

85
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:39,834
Susan Orlean and Laroche
could fall in love, and...

86
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:43,832
Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,
I don't wanna cram in sex...

87
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,925
or guns or car chases...

88
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,818
you know,
or characters, you know...

89
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:53,494
learning profound life lessons.

90
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,614
Or growing,
or coming to like each other...

91
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,160
or overcoming obstacles to succeed
in the end, you know? I mean...

92
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,766
The book isn't like that...

93
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:05,833
and life isn't like that.
You know, it just isn't. And...

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,255
I feel very strongly about this.

95
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:16,469
John Laroche is a tall guy,
skinny as a stick...

96
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:19,354
pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered...

97
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,716
sharply handsome, despite the fact
he's missing all his front teeth.

98
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,008
I went to Florida two years ago
to write a piece for The New Yorker.

99
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:32,318
It was after reading a small article about
a white man and three Seminole men...

100
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:35,134
arrested with rare orchids
they'd stolen out of a place...

101
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:38,679
called the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

102
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,395
As natural selection works solely by
and for the good of each being...

103
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,860
all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.

104
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:57,031
It's interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank...

105
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:17,052
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

106
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:20,180
A ghost.

107
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,602
Cut her down, Russell.

108
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,648
- Morning.
- Hey.

109
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,776
May I ask you gentlemen what you
have in those pillowcases?

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,487
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,928
- Okay, then, I'm asking.
- Well, okay, then.

112
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:21,492
Let's see.

113
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:25,628
We've got five kinds of bromeliad...

114
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:29,313
one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties.

115
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,422
You know,
about 130 plants all told.

116
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,925
Which my colleagues here
removed from the swamp.

117
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,721
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants
or animals from state-owned land?

118
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,702
Yeah, and don't forget...

119
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:47,352
these plants are all endangered, sir.
Every one of them.

120
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:51,627
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.

121
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,817
Yes, sir. It is.

122
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,101
- But-
- My colleagues are all Seminole indians.

123
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,760
Did I mention that?
You're familiar, I'm sure...

124
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:02,367
with the State of Florida
versus James E. Billie?

125
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:07,789
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

126
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,979
one of what, 40 in the entire world?

127
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,439
- Forty.
- Forty.

128
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:14,115
The state couldn't successfully
prosecute him...

129
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,139
because, you know, he's an indian,
and it's his right.

130
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:22,492
As repugnant as you and I, as white
conservationists, might find his actions.

131
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:25,307
- But-
- Not to mention the failed attempts...

132
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:29,860
on three occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

133
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:35,422
Which I believe they use to thatch the
roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

134
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,341
How about that?
With the chickee huts, right?

135
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:42,617
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what
we use them for. Chickee huts.

136
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,081
Yeah, but I don't...

137
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:52,627
I can't let you fellas leave yet.

138
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:57,006
- Just hold on there a minute.
- Okay.

139
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,177
Charles, is that you?

140
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:05,035
Did you eat lunch?

141
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:09,519
I had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.
Was it yours?

142
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:12,925
I hope not. I couldn't remember,
so I ate it.

143
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,192
Maybe we should write our names
on our food items from now on.

144
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:18,973
- What's with you?
- My back.

145
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:23,596
Charles, you'll be glad. I have a plan
to get me out of your house, pronto.

146
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:28,601
- A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?
- Drum roll, please.

147
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:33,050
I'm gonna be a screenwriter.
Like you.

148
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:36,109
I know you think this is just
one of my "get rich quick" schemes...

149
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,881
but I'm doing it right this time.

150
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:41,844
I'm taking a three-day seminar,
and it's only 500 bucks.

151
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,520
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

152
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:47,683
In theory, I agree with you.
But this one's different.

153
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,768
This one's highly regarded
in the industry.

154
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:52,271
Donald, don't say "industry."

155
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,356
I'm sorry. I forgot.

156
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:57,067
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

157
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:59,674
People come from all over
to study with him.

158
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,490
- I'll pay you back as soon as I-
- Let me explain something.

159
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,452
Anybody who says he's got "the answer"
is going to attract desperate people...

160
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,016
be it in the world of religion...

161
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,727
I just need to lie down
while you explain this to me.

162
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,021
Sorry. I apologize.

163
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,628
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,713
- So-
- Sorry. Okay. Go.

165
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,660
There are no rules, Donald.

166
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,301
And anybody who says there are
is just, you know...

167
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:25,638
Not rules. Principles.

168
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:30,018
McKee writes that a rule says,
"You must do it this way."

169
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,919
A principle says, "This works
and has through all remembered time."

170
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:38,047
The script I'm starting,
it's about flowers.

171
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:41,175
Nobody's ever done a movie
about flowers before.

172
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,242
- So there are no guidelines.
- What about Flowers for Algernon?

173
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:48,161
Well, that's not about flowers.
And it's not a movie.

174
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:50,142
I'm sorry. I never saw it.

175
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:51,776
How-? Okay, keep going.

176
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,522
Look, my point is
that those teachers are dangerous...

177
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,677
if your goal is to try
to do something new.

178
00:11:56,712 --> 00:12:00,674
A writer should always have that goal.
Writing is a journey into the unknown.

179
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,115
It's not building, you know,
one of your model airplanes.

180
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,101
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar,
Charles.

181
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:14,438
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

182
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:20,799
Say something. I dragged her here,
and now I'm not saying anything.

183
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,780
Make her laugh.
Say something funny.

184
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,603
I hate parties, Amelia.
Why did we come here?

185
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:29,558
Because we're hip, young trendsetters
on the make, aren't we?

186
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,373
More like old losers
sitting on the floor, maybe.

187
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:37,482
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself.
Okay...

188
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:40,610
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

189
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:45,303
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie
Kaufman mess for once and for all.

190
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,040
- Okay.
- Okay, let me see.

191
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:50,621
What do you need?
What, what, what?

192
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,749
Well, I'm glad you took
the orchid script.

193
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:57,190
I think it will be good for you
to get out of your head.

194
00:12:57,294 --> 00:13:01,778
I think it'll ground you to think about the
bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

195
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,802
I still can't believe they gave me
that job.

196
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:08,973
I mean, after that lunch.
I was sweating insanely.

197
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,892
I was ranting. I was a mess.

198
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,082
You were just nervous
because she was pretty.

199
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,959
How do you know she was pretty?

200
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:20,130
After eight months of knowing you,
I think I get what makes you sweat.

201
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,953
Well, whatever.
Well, moving on, what next?

202
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:27,742
You need a new getup.
This whole flannel shirt thing...

203
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:31,496
it's not really doing anything
for you anymore.

204
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:37,335
Thanks for coming out
with me tonight, Amelia.

205
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:56,625
To begin.

206
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,024
How to start?

207
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,117
I'm hungry.

208
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:03,716
I should get coffee.

209
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,801
Coffee would help me think.

210
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,660
But I should write something first,
then reward myself with coffee.

211
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:15,499
Coffee and a muffin. Okay,
so I need to establish the themes.

212
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,731
Maybe banana-nut.

213
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,130
That's a good muffin.

214
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,760
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

215
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,244
Victorian-era orchid hunter
William Arnold...

216
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:34,164
drowned on a collecting expedition.

217
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,335
Osmers vanished without a trace
in Asia.

218
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:47,198
Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

219
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,577
only to be murdered when
he completed his mission...

220
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,705
and traveled beyond Bhamo.

221
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:00,510
Laroche loved orchids, but I...

222
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:04,507
I came to believe he loved the
difficulty and fatality of getting them...

223
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,365
almost as much as he loved
the orchids themselves.

224
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:12,223
I've been a professional horticulturist
for, like, 12 years.

225
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,333
I owned my own plant nursery,
which was destroyed by the hurricane.

226
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,522
I'm a professional plant lecturer.

227
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,068
I've given over, like, 60 lectures
on the cultivation of plants.

228
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:27,030
I'm a published author,
both in magazine and book form.

229
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:29,533
And I have extensive experience
with orchids...

230
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:35,268
and the asexual micropropagation
of orchids under aseptic cultures.

231
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:40,168
That's laboratory work.
It's not at all like your nursery work.

232
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,505
I'm probably the smartest person
I know.

233
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,321
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

234
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,515
Mr. Laroche? I'm Susan Orlean.

235
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,227
I'm a writer for The New Yorker.
It's a magazine that...

236
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,416
I'm familiar with The New Yorker.

237
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,857
"The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker." Right?

238
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,526
That's right.

239
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:07,488
I'm very interested in doing a piece
on your situation here, and...

240
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,261
Yeah? Yeah.

241
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,346
You wanna put this in?

242
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,536
I don't care what goes on here.

243
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,768
I'm right, and I'll take it all the way
to Supreme Court.

244
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:20,105
Because that judge can screw herself.

245
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:30,324
- That for real would go in?
- Absolutely.

246
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,446
We open on State Road 29.

247
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:45,026
A battered white van speeds along,
making a sharp, skidding right...

248
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,807
into the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

249
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:51,700
The driver of the van is a skinny man
with no front teeth.

250
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,141
This is John Laroche.

251
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,269
I need a break.

252
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:03,430
- I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

253
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:07,549
- The end was a little weird, but-
- Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

254
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,113
It was exultant.

255
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:14,014
The soloist was amazing.
Such beautiful tones. So precise.

256
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,682
God, it blows my mind.

257
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:18,811
- I wish I could play like that.
- You do.

258
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,982
Charlie. I don't.
I'm mediocre at best.

259
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:25,380
Well, I love listening to you play.

260
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,153
Thanks, Charlie.

261
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,741
Here we are.

262
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,588
What are you up to now, then?

263
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:43,732
I should probably get to bed.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

264
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,234
Well, good night, then.

265
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,036
I would stay out.

266
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,338
It's just that I've really been struggling
on the script right now.

267
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:03,022
I've been thinking about it too small,
just writing it like a story about Laroche.

268
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:06,324
That's not enough. I mean,
I wanted to write about flowers.

269
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,634
Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I
haven't been sleeping very well lately...

270
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,407
so I thought I should get home...

271
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,786
and try to get a good night's sleep,
you know. Start fresh in the morning.

272
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,872
Otherwise, I'd stay out.

273
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:23,251
I understand. I hope you figure it out,
Charlie. I really do.

274
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:26,380
Thanks. Thanks for coming out
with me and everything.

275
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:28,361
Sure, it was fun.

276
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:33,262
So I have to go to Santa Barbara next
weekend for this orchid show up there.

277
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:36,181
I thought maybe you could come.

278
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,267
No, I...

279
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:42,020
I don't think I can make it
next weekend.

280
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,419
I don't think I can.

281
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,130
I've got something. Sorry.

282
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:48,867
Okay.

283
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:52,031
So, well, okay, then.
So good night, then.

284
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,325
Good night, Charlie.

285
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:58,078
Why didn't I go in?
I'm such a chick en.

286
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:01,102
I'm such an idiot. I should have
kissed her. I've blown it.

287
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,022
I should just go and knock
on her door right now and kiss her.

288
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:08,714
It would be romantic. Something
we could someday tell our kids.

289
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,634
I'm gonna do that right now.

290
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,777
- Thanks for picking me up.
- This van's a piece of shit.

291
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:33,114
But when I hit the jackpot,
I'll buy myself an awesome car.

292
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,460
Hey, what are you driving?

293
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:37,702
It's-Well, it's a rental.

294
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:40,900
- It's a Lumina.
- Awesome.

295
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,854
I think I'll get one of those too.

296
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:50,424
Here we go.

297
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,950
Where do these people learn
to drive?

298
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,827
The world's insane.

299
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,503
So I was impressed to hear...

300
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:03,249
how accomplished you are
in the world of horticulture.

301
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:05,300
The thing you gotta know is...

302
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,463
my whole life is looking for
a goddamn profitable plant, see?

303
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,923
And that's the ghost.

304
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:11,174
Why the ghost orchid?

305
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:15,762
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

306
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:19,672
And I'm the only one in the world
who knows how to cultivate it.

307
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:23,443
See, the idea was, get the indians
to pull it from the swamp.

308
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:27,753
I researched it. Long as I don't touch
the plant, Florida can't touch us.

309
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,280
And I stop future poaching by making
the flowers readily available in stores.

310
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,199
I'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

311
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,702
Laroche and nature win.

312
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:41,517
Great.

313
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:43,916
Did you get that last part?

314
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,897
Yeah, I sure did.

315
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:49,094
Orchids are the sexiest flowers
on Earth.

316
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:54,864
The name orchid derives from the
Latin orchis, which means testicle.

317
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,324
Hey, Charles.

318
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:58,305
I pitched my screenplay to Mom.

319
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:00,251
Don't say "pitch."

320
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:02,789
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

321
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:05,083
Silence of the Lambs
meets Psycho.

322
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:09,462
Maybe you guys could collaborate.
I hear Mom's really good with structure.

323
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:13,842
So how come Amelia
doesn't come around anymore?

324
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:17,179
Did you put the moves on her
or something?

325
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,707
I'm looking for John Laroche.

326
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:50,233
I'm writing an article on John,
and I stopped by.

327
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,110
- I hoped I could see him.
- John's not here.

328
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,063
Well, you were at the swamp
with him, weren't you?

329
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,826
I saw you at the courthouse,
that's how I know.

330
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,016
I'm Matthew Osceola.

331
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,101
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

332
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,986
Maybe I could talk to you
for a second.

333
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,836
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the whole operation...

334
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,756
You have very beautiful hair.

335
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:18,960
Thank you very much.

336
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:21,098
Thank you. I just...

337
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:25,582
I just washed it this morning.

338
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:29,127
I just used a new conditioner.

339
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,009
I can see your sadness.

340
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,990
It's lovely.

341
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:44,351
Well, I'm just tired, that's all.
That's my problem.

342
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:46,749
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

343
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:51,024
- And I could get some background-
- I'm not going to talk to you much.

344
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,901
It's not personal.

345
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:56,134
It's the indian way.

346
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,045
Angraecum sesquipedale.

347
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,242
Beauty! God!

348
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,571
Darwin wrote about this one.

349
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:21,333
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy?
Hello?

350
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,453
You see that nectary
all the way down there?

351
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:25,851
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

352
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:29,709
with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

353
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:32,004
Everyone thought he was a loon.

354
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:36,661
Then, sure enough, they found
this moth with a 12-inch proboscis.

355
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:39,824
- "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
- I know what "proboscis" means.

356
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:44,099
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

357
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,810
The point is,
what's so wonderful...

358
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:50,147
is that every one of these flowers
has a specific relationship...

359
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:51,989
with the insect that pollinates it.

360
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:54,944
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

361
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,863
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

362
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:01,200
its double, its soul mate...

363
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:04,849
and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

364
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:07,456
After the insect flies off...

365
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:12,461
it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

366
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:16,007
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand...

367
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:19,135
the significance
of their lovemaking.

368
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,993
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

369
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,974
But it does.

370
00:24:25,078 --> 00:24:27,268
By simply doing
what they're designed to do...

371
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:30,031
something large
and magnificent happens.

372
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:32,690
In this sense, they show us
how to live.

373
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:36,513
How the only barometer
you have is your heart.

374
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:42,283
How when you spot your flower,
you can't let anything get in your way.

375
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,502
He's really quite a character.
No front teeth.

376
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:55,943
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all.
- Why doesn't he get them fixed?

377
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:59,488
It seems almost sociopathic
to make everybody look at that.

378
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:02,512
Yeah, but he gives
a great blowjob, honey.

379
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:06,788
He is a fascinating character, though.

380
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:09,255
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

381
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,905
It could be. I don't know, you know?
He's...

382
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,319
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed
with his dead mother, and...

383
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:21,699
He wears his sunglasses on
a little dingle-dangle around his neck.

384
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,471
Loving it.

385
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:27,607
- Tell them about the van.
- Okay, the van. The van.

386
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:30,875
- I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.
- No, tell us about the van.

387
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,211
- It's amazing. It's...
- What's in it?

388
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:37,617
- You did it in the van.
- Shut up.

389
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:40,363
David, you tell-
Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

390
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,032
Okay, the van.

391
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:44,222
David!

392
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:48,393
This van was filled with junk...

393
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:49,540
Shut up!

394
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:53,554
Potting soil. Shovels.
Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

395
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,464
Susie said she hoped
it was fertilizer, anyway.

396
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:01,322
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche
had a certain aromatic look about him.

397
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:02,365
And she said...

398
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:06,119
She said perhaps his obsessiveness
didn't leave room in his schedule...

399
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:08,413
for personal hygiene.

400
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:12,688
Maybe the orchids got
all the available water.

401
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:19,049
I wanted to want something as much
as people wanted these plants.

402
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,134
But...

403
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,992
it isn't part of my constitution.

404
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:30,519
I suppose I do have
one unembarrassed passion.

405
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:37,714
I wanna know what it feels like
to care about something passionately.

406
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:52,520
"Should one be lucky enough
to see a ghost orchid...

407
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:55,961
all else will seem eclipsed."

408
00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:01,696
If the ghost orchid
was really a phantom...

409
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:06,284
it was still such a bewitching one that
it could seduce people to pursue it...

410
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,795
year after year
and mile after miserable mile.

411
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,271
If it was a real flower,
I wanted to see one.

412
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:17,129
The reason was not that I love orchids.
I don't even especially like orchids.

413
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:20,778
What I wanted
was to see this thing...

414
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:27,452
that people were drawn to
in such a singular and powerful way.

415
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:33,604
So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?

416
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,419
I lost interest right after that.

417
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,259
I dropped turtles when I fell
in love with ice Age fossils.

418
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:44,935
Collected the shit out of them.

419
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,141
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

420
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:53,103
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

421
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,258
My mom and I
had the largest collection...

422
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:58,490
of 19th-century Dutch mirrors
on the planet.

423
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:01,549
Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World, October '88?

424
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:04,260
I got a copy here somewhere.

425
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:09,057
I guess I'd just like to know
how you can detach from something...

426
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,664
that you've invested
so much of your soul in.

427
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:16,425
I mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

428
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,840
The only thing that made
your 10-year-old life worth living?

429
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:24,698
Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?

430
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:30,745
I once fell deeply, you know,
profoundly in love with tropical fish.

431
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,265
I had 60 goddamn fish-tanks
in my house.

432
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,716
I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones.

433
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:41,381
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus
ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

434
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,258
You name it.

435
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:46,699
Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

436
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:51,287
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

437
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:54,103
That's how much "fuck fish."

438
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:59,733
That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

439
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,923
And I love the ocean.

440
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,051
But why?

441
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,118
Done with fish.

442
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:14,540
If you'd really loved something,
wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

443
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:17,773
Evidently Laroche's finishes
were downright and absolute.

444
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:19,337
He just moved on.

445
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:23,508
I sometimes wished
I could do the same.

446
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,745
Good afternoon.
So, what looks good today?

447
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:33,726
The key lime pie, please.

448
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:35,603
A small slice.

449
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,627
And a coffee, please.
Skim milk, please.

450
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:43,007
Orchids. I love orchids.

451
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:44,779
Cool. That's...

452
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,870
Well, I'll be right back with your pie.

453
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,738
I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to come to an orchid show.

454
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:08,345
I think these flowers are so sexy.

455
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,099
Let's see what's around back.

456
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,394
What?

457
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,418
- You wanna hear my pitch?
- Go away, goddamn it.

458
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:44,111
You know, I'm just trying
to do something.

459
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:51,479
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

460
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:53,704
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

461
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,623
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

462
00:30:56,728 --> 00:31:00,898
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

463
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:03,627
He's already holding her hostage
in his creepy basement.

464
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:06,321
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity...

465
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:08,788
and in the process
falls in love with her.

466
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,951
Even though he's never even met her.
She becomes like...

467
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:15,357
Like the unattainable.
Like the Holy Grail.

468
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:19,146
- It's a little obvious, don't you think?
- Okay, but here's the twist.

469
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,440
We find out that the killer...

470
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:24,673
really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

471
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:28,427
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

472
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:31,763
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

473
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:38,020
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

474
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,418
On top of that, you explore
the notion...

475
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:43,755
that cop and criminal are
really two aspects of the same person.

476
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,883
See every cop movie ever made
for other examples of this.

477
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,698
Mom called it psychologically taut.

478
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:53,765
The other thing is, there's no way
to write this. Did you consider that?

479
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,457
I mean, how could you have somebody
held prisoner in a basement...

480
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:02,628
and working in a police station
at the same time?

481
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:06,590
- Trick photography.
- Okay, that's not what I'm asking.

482
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:09,475
Listen closely.
What I'm asking is:

483
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:14,619
In the reality of this movie, where
there's only one character, right?

484
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:16,184
Okay?

485
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,373
How could you...?

486
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,127
What exactly would...?

487
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,985
I agree with Mom. Very taut.

488
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,113
Sybil meets, I don't know...
Dressed to Kill.

489
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,477
Cool. I really liked Dressed to Kill.

490
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:35,995
- Until the third act denouement.
- That's not how it's pronounced.

491
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,645
Sorry. I-Okay, sorry.

492
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,447
- Some key lime pie for you today?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

493
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:52,227
I'll cut you an extra-large slice.
Preferred customer.

494
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:56,120
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
- Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?

495
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,613
- Still reading about orchids, I hope?
- Yes, I am.

496
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,794
This friend of mine
has this little, tiny pink one...

497
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:05,574
that grows on a tree branch
just like that.

498
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,320
- I can't remember-
- That's called an epiphyte.

499
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:10,579
Right. Right!

500
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,282
Boy, you know your stuff.

501
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,793
No, not really. I'm just learning.

502
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,817
Epiphytes grow on trees,
but they're not parasites.

503
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:21,563
They get all their nourishment
from the air and the rain.

504
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:25,838
Well, I'm impressed. That's great.

505
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:29,070
There are more than 30.000 kinds
of orchids in the world.

506
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,824
- That's a lot?
- Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,075
Yeah.

508
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:39,602
So I'll be right back with an extra-large
slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

509
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:43,043
But-So anyway,
I was also wondering...

510
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:49,195
I'm going up to Santa Barbara this
Saturday for an orchid show, and I...

511
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:53,227
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

512
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:57,328
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- So I'll just be right back with your pie.

513
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,822
There are more than 30.000
known orchid species.

514
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:14,221
One looks like a turtle.

515
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:17,244
One looks like a monkey.

516
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,233
One looks like an onion.

517
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,354
One looks like a schoolteacher.

518
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,335
One looks like a gymnast.

519
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:27,463
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin.

520
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,966
One looks like a New York
intellectual...

521
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,198
with whom you do the Sunday
Times crossword puzzle in bed.

522
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:36,014
One looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen.

523
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,412
One looks like Amelia.

524
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:40,289
One has eyes that dance.

525
00:34:40,393 --> 00:34:44,251
One has eyes that contain
the sadness of the world.

526
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,489
So I got married,
and me and my beautiful new wife...

527
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,617
my now ex-wife, the bitch...

528
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:58,606
opened up a nursery.

529
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:01,873
People started coming out
of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

530
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:05,627
and admire my plants
and admire me.

531
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:12,196
I think some people were really spending
time with me because they were lonely.

532
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:21,059
And you know why I like plants?

533
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:26,273
Because they're so mutable.

534
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:31,382
Adaptation's a profound process.

535
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,259
It means you...

536
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,909
figure out how to thrive in the world.

537
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,417
Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
I mean...

538
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,294
they have no memory.

539
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:51,611
You know, they just move on to
whatever's next. But a person, now...

540
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:56,408
adapting's almost shameful.
I mean, it's like...

541
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:58,911
running away.

542
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,719
Keener!

543
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,900
Hey, man.

544
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:52,368
Please don't hit
on crew members, Donald.

545
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:56,469
What, the makeup girl?
She was hitting on me, bro.

546
00:36:57,408 --> 00:36:59,910
Don't embarrass me.
I have to work with these people.

547
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:03,351
I won't. Anyway, listen...

548
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:07,418
I meant to ask you,
I need a cool way to kill people.

549
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:12,179
Don't worry. For my script.

550
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:14,404
I don't write that kind of stuff.

551
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:18,367
Come on, man, please?
You're the genius.

552
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:22,120
Here you go: The killer's
a literature professor.

553
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:26,187
He cuts off little chunks from his
victim's bodies until they die.

554
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,628
He calls himself
"The Deconstructionist."

555
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:35,259
- That's kind of good. I like that.
- See, I was kidding, Donald.

556
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:38,699
Okay. Sorry.

557
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:41,202
You got me.

558
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,582
Do you mind if I use it, though?

559
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:56,634
- It's really good.
- I tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

560
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:00,249
- From the beginning to the end.
- I saw that. Why did you do that?

561
00:38:00,284 --> 00:38:04,351
Because I wanted there to be more
tension. And then you pick it up later...

562
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,958
- But are you changing...?
- Keeps more tension.

563
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:10,712
That way the audience
gets stuck early on.

564
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,901
- You like it?
- I really like it.

565
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:24,893
You look hot tonight, baby.

566
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:29,168
Thanks, Donald.
That's swell of you to say.

567
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:33,339
- Don't you think she's hot, bro?
- I'm heading home, Donald.

568
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,424
Really? Come on.

569
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,344
Hey, it's Amelia.

570
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:40,325
Hey, Amelia!

571
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:44,079
Hey, Donald. Hey, Charlie.

572
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,927
- Hey. Hi there.
- God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

573
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:53,255
- It's good to see you.
- This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

574
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,966
- She's a makeup artist for the movies.
- Hi.

575
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:58,990
Hi.

576
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,763
This is David, my friend.

577
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,856
- Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

578
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:06,706
- Amelia's talked a lot about you.
- Hi, I'm Donald.

579
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,382
- Hey.
- Caroline.

580
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,086
- Cool camera.
- So how are you?

581
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:15,048
- You know me, a mess.
- Charlie...

582
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,655
it's really good to see you.
Is the work good?

583
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:19,949
It's a disaster.
I don't know what I'm doing.

584
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,764
But, anyway, it's my problem.
I don't want to bore you.

585
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:26,726
You have your own stuff, right? I mean,
we both have our own separate stuff.

586
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,646
Anyway, I should go. I was just
heading home to do some work.

587
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,191
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

588
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:36,111
A little push, push in the bush.

589
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:39,656
Donald, you're such a tard!

590
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,533
See you, Charlie.

591
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:48,937
To write about a flower,
to dramatize a flower...

592
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,022
I have to show the flower's arc.

593
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:54,359
And the flower's arc stretches back
to the beginning of life.

594
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:57,696
How did this flower get here?
What was its journey?

595
00:39:58,217 --> 00:40:01,345
Therefore, I should infer
from analogy...

596
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:07,601
that probably all the organic beings
which have ever lived on this Earth...

597
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:13,024
have descended
from some one primordial form...

598
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:16,065
into which life was first breathed.

599
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,072
It is a journey of evolution.
Adaptation.

600
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:23,086
The journey we all take. A journey
that unites each and every one of us.

601
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:26,996
Darwin writes that we all come
from the very first single-cell organism.

602
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:28,769
Yet here I am.

603
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:31,654
And there's Laroche.
There's Orlean.

604
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:35,442
And there's the ghost orchid.
All trapped in our own bodies...

605
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:38,744
in moments in history.
That's it.

606
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:43,054
That's what I need to do.
Tie all of history together.

607
00:40:44,723 --> 00:40:47,538
Start right before
life begins on the planet.

608
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:48,963
All is...

609
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,987
lifeless.
And then, like, life begins...

610
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:54,281
with organisms.
Those little single-cell ones.

611
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:57,444
And it's before sex, because,
like, everything was asexual.

612
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,051
From there we go to bigger things.
Jellyfish.

613
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,866
Then that fish that got legs
and crawled out on the land.

614
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,272
And then we see,
you know, like, dinosaurs.

615
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:11,312
And then they're around for a long time.
Then an asteroid comes and:

616
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:14,545
The insects, the mammals,
the primates, monkeys.

617
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:18,299
The simple monkeys. Old-fashioned
monkeys giving way to the new ones.

618
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:20,801
Whatever. And then apes.
Whatever. And man.

619
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:25,598
Then we see the whole history of
human civilization.: hunting, war, love...

620
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,787
heartache, disease,
loneliness, technology.

621
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:31,958
And we end with Susan Orlean
in her office at The New Yorker...

622
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:34,565
writing about flowers, and bang!
The movie begins.

623
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:38,423
This is the breakthrough I've been
hoping for. It's never been done.

624
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,551
McKee is a genius!

625
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:46,869
And hilarious. He just comes up with all
these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

626
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,998
But he's serious too, Charles.
You'd love him.

627
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:53,021
He's all for originality, just like you.

628
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:57,192
But he says we have to realize
that we all write in a genre...

629
00:41:57,227 --> 00:42:00,425
and we must find our originality
within that genre.

630
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:06,056
There hasn't been a new genre since
Fellini invented the mockumentary.

631
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,975
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

632
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:13,250
You and I share the same DNA.

633
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:16,796
Is there anything more lonely than that?

634
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,151
What'd you say, bro?

635
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:26,597
- Yeah?
- Hey.

636
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:29,517
Hey, Susie-Q.

637
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:30,664
What you up to?

638
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:35,252
I don't wanna bother you. Just thought
I'd call and get some more info.

639
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:40,570
I think you say some
pretty smart things, John.

640
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,655
Yeah, smartest guy I know?

641
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,765
So...

642
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,789
whatever happened
to your nursery?

643
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,593
It was going pretty well.

644
00:42:56,628 --> 00:43:01,737
But, you know, sometimes bad
things happen, darkness descends.

645
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:12,947
Nursery business good, Johnny?

646
00:43:12,982 --> 00:43:15,189
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

647
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,795
This last year's been a dream.

648
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,819
I'm telling you.
Finally pulling out of debt.

649
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:24,052
Amen, honey.
I'm so proud of you two, and...

650
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:43,029
No, ma'am. I'm sorry,
I can't answer that.

651
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:44,802
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

652
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:49,181
- Hold it. Which ones are dead?
- Sir, please, don't move.

653
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:53,352
- Which ones are dead?
- Let's move it!

654
00:43:56,898 --> 00:44:01,903
I killed my mom, you know,
and my uncle.

655
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:05,865
That's how I lost my front teeth.

656
00:44:07,951 --> 00:44:12,956
And my wife was in a coma
for, like, three weeks.

657
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:17,439
And she divorced me soon after
she regained consciousness.

658
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:36,626
Well, I think if I almost died,
I would leave my marriage too.

659
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:40,379
Why?

660
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:43,195
Because I could.

661
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,366
Because it's like a free pass.
Nobody can judge you...

662
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,650
if you almost died.

663
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:53,831
Well, I judged her.

664
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:57,167
Maybe I was being judged too.

665
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:03,841
It was like a month after that, Hurricane
Andrew came along and just...

666
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:06,343
swooped down
like an angel of God...

667
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:12,287
and just wiped out everything
I had left.

668
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,728
Everything.

669
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:19,482
I knew it'd break my heart
to start another nursery...

670
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,471
so, you know,
when the Seminoles called...

671
00:45:22,506 --> 00:45:28,241
they wanted a white guy or an expert
to get their nursery going, I took the job.

672
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:33,350
I wasn't gonna give them a
conventional little potted-plant place.

673
00:45:33,872 --> 00:45:36,166
I was gonna give them something...

674
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,346
amazing, you know?

675
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:42,422
Yeah, I know, John.

676
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,889
I know.

677
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:47,844
"I was going to give them
something amazing."

678
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:53,371
It's beautifully written.
You have such a unique voice.

679
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:56,151
Thank you very much.

680
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,418
- We're big fans.
- Thank you.

681
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,234
Laroche is such a fun character.

682
00:46:03,172 --> 00:46:05,675
- Yeah.
- It's funny and fresh.

683
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:08,386
And sad in a way.

684
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,576
So we were wondering what's next.

685
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,808
Well, Random House has asked me...

686
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:16,623
to expand it into a book,
so I'm gonna be doing that.

687
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:19,856
- And-
- Susan, we would like to option this.

688
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:25,487
- You wanna make it into a movie?
- Into a movie.

689
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,259
Oh, God!

690
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:31,326
- That's really...
- How does that sound?

691
00:46:31,361 --> 00:46:33,307
- That's very exciting.
- Good.

692
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:37,582
It's just comical. I hadn't thought of it.
I've never written a screenplay before.

693
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:41,649
Don't worry about that. We have
screenwriters to write the screenplay.

694
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:48,427
Hey, superstar.
It's Marty, super agent.

695
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:51,555
I just wanna remind you
it's been 13 weeks...

696
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,536
and Valerie's anxious
to see a draft.

697
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,873
So if you could wrap things up and
get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

698
00:46:56,908 --> 00:47:00,522
Call me when you get this.
Adios, amigo.

699
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,551
What? What'd you laugh at?

700
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:11,680
- You're a genius.
- Which line?

701
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,452
You're a genius.
You're a genius.

702
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,301
"We see orchid hunter
Augustus Margary."

703
00:47:42,336 --> 00:47:46,611
He wears a filthy, spittle-soak ed
rag around his head to quell the pain.

704
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:50,886
The back of his trousers are stained
greasy black from an anal leakage...

705
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:52,555
due to dysentery.

706
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:58,602
"He moans with each tentative step
through the overgrown jungle."

707
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:00,062
I'm fuck ed.

708
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:04,442
We open with Laroche. He's funny.
He says, "I love to mutate plants."

709
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:07,466
He says, "Mutation is fun."
Okay, we show flowers and... Okay.

710
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,447
We have to have the court case.
We show Laroche.

711
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,366
He says, "I was mutated as a baby.
That's why I'm so smart."

712
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:15,182
That's funny. Okay, we open
at the beginning of time. No!

713
00:48:15,217 --> 00:48:17,893
- Laroche is driving into the swamp.
- Crazy White Man!

714
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:28,112
I don't know how to adapt this.
I should have stuck with my own stuff.

715
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:30,406
I don't know why I thought
I could write this.

716
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,657
See her?

717
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:35,098
I fucked her up the ass.

718
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,288
No. I'm kidding.

719
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:41,980
Maybe I can help.

720
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,739
It's about flowers.

721
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:53,450
Okay.

722
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:58,246
But it's not only about flowers, right?
You have the crazy plant-nut guy, right?

723
00:48:58,281 --> 00:49:00,645
He's funny. Right?

724
00:49:04,294 --> 00:49:07,840
"There's not nearly enough of him
to fill a book."

725
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:12,914
So Orlean "digresses in long
passages." Blah, blah, blah.

726
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,660
"No narrative unites these passages."
New York Times Book Review.

727
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:19,518
I can't structure this. It's that
sprawling New Yorker shit.

728
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,708
Man, I'd fuck her up the ass.

729
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:27,130
- Sorry.
- The book has no story. There's no story.

730
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,216
All right. Make one up.

731
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,386
I mean, nobody in this town
can make up a crazy story like you.

732
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:37,453
- You're the king of that.
- No, I didn't want to do that this time.

733
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:42,110
It's someone else's material.
I have a responsibility to Susan...

734
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:46,421
Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.
I wanted to do something simple.

735
00:49:46,456 --> 00:49:49,757
Show people how amazing
flowers are.

736
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,051
Are they amazing?

737
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,099
I don't know. I think they are.

738
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:04,564
- I need you to get me out of this.
- All right.

739
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,700
Charlie, you've been stringing
them along for months now.

740
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:13,636
Not to give them anything at this
point would be a terrible career move.

741
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,959
Hey, my script's going amazing.

742
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,461
Right now, I'm working out
an image system.

743
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:30,267
Because of my multiple personality
theme, I've chosen a motif...

744
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:33,934
of broken mirrors to show my
protagonist's fragmented self.

745
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:38,453
Bob says an image system increases
the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

746
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:40,747
- Bob says-
- You sound like you're in a cult.

747
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:44,048
No, it's just good writing technique.

748
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,420
I made you a copy
of McKee's 10 Commandments.

749
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:50,131
I posted one over
both our work areas.

750
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:01,914
You shouldn't have done that.

751
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,275
Because it's extremely helpful.
Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.

752
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,630
"Happy Together."

753
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:12,863
Like when characters sing songs
in their pajamas and dance around.

754
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,740
I thought it'd break the tension.

755
00:51:14,844 --> 00:51:18,250
At first I was nervous
about putting a song in a thriller...

756
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:23,082
but Bob says that Casablanca, one of
the greatest screenplays ever written...

757
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:25,862
did exactly that. Mixed genres.

758
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:28,608
I haven't slept in a week, Donald.

759
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,736
- I need to go to bed.
- Okay.

760
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,134
Good night.

761
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:42,789
- Yeah?
- Hi.

762
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,979
John, it's Susan again.

763
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,211
Hey, Susie-Q.

764
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:51,027
How's it going?

765
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:54,468
Great. I'm training myself
on the internet.

766
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:57,283
It's fascinating.
I'm doing pornography.

767
00:51:57,387 --> 00:52:01,558
It's amazing how much these suckers
will pay for photographs of chicks.

768
00:52:01,593 --> 00:52:05,625
It doesn't matter if they're fat
or ugly or what.

769
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,293
Well, that sounds good.

770
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:10,178
It's great, is what it is.

771
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:14,905
Listen, John, I hate feeling like
I'm being a pain to you, but I...

772
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,782
I still haven't seen a ghost.

773
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:21,787
- Yeah?
- And I was hoping maybe you'd...

774
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,039
Yeah.

775
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,020
Yeah, I'll take you in.

776
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:28,044
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

777
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:32,319
Thank you so much.

778
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,987
Oh, John.

779
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,698
Damn it.

780
00:52:48,273 --> 00:52:52,026
There are too many ideas
and things and people.

781
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:54,112
Too many directions to go.

782
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:59,117
I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care about something...

783
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,411
is that it whittles the world down...

784
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:05,269
to a more manageable size.

785
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:09,231
Such sweet, sad insights.

786
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,777
So true.

787
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:28,730
I like looking at you.

788
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:33,006
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

789
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:12,629
I don't know how to do this.

790
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:16,331
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

791
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:19,511
You've written a beautiful book.

792
00:54:19,616 --> 00:54:22,327
I can't sleep.

793
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:26,915
I'm losing my hair.
I'm fat and repulsive.

794
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:30,669
You're not. You're not.

795
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:35,308
Just whittle it down, you know?

796
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:38,906
Focus on one thing in the story.

797
00:54:39,532 --> 00:54:42,139
Find that one thing...

798
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:45,684
that you care passionately about...

799
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,874
and then write about that.

800
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:51,315
We see Susan Orlean:
Delicate, haunted by loneliness...

801
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:52,948
fragile, beautiful.

802
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:57,050
She lies awake next to her sleeping,
insensitive husband.

803
00:54:57,154 --> 00:54:58,405
Her voice-over begins:

804
00:54:58,822 --> 00:55:02,785
"I suppose I do
have one unembarrassed passion.

805
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:07,477
I want to know how it feels to care
about something passionately."

806
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:13,316
- Hey.
- Morning.

807
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,078
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

808
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:22,770
- You seem chipper.
- I'm good. I have some new ideas.

809
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:27,879
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

810
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:32,815
- I got some ideas too this morning.
- He got really, really good ones.

811
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,214
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

812
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:38,029
I'm putting-Hey! What?

813
00:55:40,114 --> 00:55:43,243
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

814
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:46,788
flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

815
00:55:46,823 --> 00:55:49,603
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

816
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,523
Like technology versus horse.

817
00:55:52,627 --> 00:55:55,025
And they're still all one person, right?

818
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,701
Well, that's the big payoff.

819
00:55:57,736 --> 00:56:00,621
- It sounds exciting.
- Thanks, man.

820
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:03,784
- Thanks.
- See, I told you he was gonna like it.

821
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:09,311
- You're my muse. You are.
- I love being your muse.

822
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:12,230
I'm so happy about that.

823
00:56:13,482 --> 00:56:16,089
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

824
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:36,282
- Valerie.
- Hi, Charlie.

825
00:56:36,317 --> 00:56:38,368
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

826
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:41,218
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

827
00:56:41,253 --> 00:56:43,304
- That's okay.
- I meant to because...

828
00:56:43,408 --> 00:56:45,911
things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

829
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:48,274
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.

830
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:51,072
You should sit down because
I'm here with Susan right now.

831
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,835
And she's dying to meet you,
so it's funny bumping into you.

832
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,295
- Have a seat.
- Susan Orlean is here?

833
00:56:55,399 --> 00:57:00,509
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading
or something. She's just on the phone.

834
00:57:01,343 --> 00:57:04,158
Sit down. Have a seat.
She's dying to meet you.

835
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:09,581
Well, I should probably go, because...

836
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:11,457
Well, I'd love to meet her too...

837
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:14,690
but I don't want to be beholden.
And, well...

838
00:57:14,794 --> 00:57:17,818
Because once you meet somebody
that you've been writing about...

839
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:20,321
it becomes very hard to separate.
So...

840
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,136
Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.
And I'm almost done.

841
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,283
I'm almost done.

842
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:27,515
And tell Susan that I would
love to meet with her at a future date.

843
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,288
- As she sees fit.
- Okay.

844
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,971
Who am I kidding?
This is not Susan Orlean's story.

845
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:37,491
I have no connection with her.
I can't even meet her.

846
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:40,758
I have no understanding of anything
but my own panic and self-loathing...

847
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:42,322
and pathetic, little existence.

848
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:46,702
The only thing I'm actually qualified to
write about is myself and my own self...

849
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:48,266
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

850
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:53,062
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in
a Hollywood restaurant...

851
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:57,755
across from Valerie Thomas,
a lovely, statuesque film executive.

852
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,570
Kaufman, trying to get
a writing assignment...

853
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:03,802
wanting to impress her,
sweats profusely.

854
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:12,422
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously
in his bedroom.

855
00:58:12,457 --> 00:58:16,107
He speaks into his hand-held
tape recorder, and he says:

856
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:20,903
"Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,
repulsive, old...

857
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:23,614
sits at a Hollywood restaurant
with Valerie Thomas."

858
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:25,491
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

859
00:58:25,596 --> 00:58:27,994
jerks off to the book jack et photo
of Susan Or...

860
00:58:28,307 --> 00:58:29,836
What do you want?

861
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:31,643
I've finished my script.

862
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:33,833
I'm done.

863
00:58:36,544 --> 00:58:38,734
So would you show it to your agent?

864
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:42,175
It's called The Three.

865
00:58:46,763 --> 00:58:49,057
Thanks. I also want to
thank you for your idea.

866
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:51,351
It was very helpful.
I changed it a little.

867
00:58:51,455 --> 00:58:55,209
Now the killer cuts off body pieces
and makes his victims eat them.

868
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:58,650
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake
swallowing its own tail, and...

869
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:01,882
- Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that means.

870
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,176
The snake. It's called Ourobouros.

871
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:07,722
I don't think so. But it's cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi...

872
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:10,746
because when he forces the woman
who's really him to eat herself...

873
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,623
he's also eating himself to death.

874
00:59:12,658 --> 00:59:14,082
I'm insane.

875
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,384
- I'm Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that word means.

876
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:21,382
- I've written myself into my screenplay.
- That's kind of weird?

877
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:24,405
It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

878
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,012
It's solipsistic. It's pathetic.

879
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:29,167
I'm pathetic.
I'm fat and pathetic.

880
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:32,921
I'm sure you had good reasons, Charles.
You're an artist.

881
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:36,293
It's because I'm too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book.

882
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:38,274
Because I'm pathetic.

883
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:42,549
Because I have no idea how to write.
Because I can't make flowers fascinating.

884
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:44,530
Because I suck.

885
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:47,867
- Hey, am I in the script?
- I'm going to New York.

886
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:51,412
I'll meet her. That's it.
That's what I have to do.

887
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:53,289
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

888
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:55,687
but Bob's having a seminar
in New York this weekend.

889
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,669
So if you're stuck...

890
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:02,569
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

891
01:00:02,604 --> 01:00:04,968
No shit, I'm a fun character.

892
01:00:05,003 --> 01:00:06,323
Who's gonna play me?

893
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:08,721
Well, I've gotta write
the book first, John.

894
01:00:08,826 --> 01:00:11,745
Then, you know, they get somebody
to write the screenplay.

895
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,039
Hey, I think I should play me.

896
01:00:14,352 --> 01:00:19,844
Most people yearn for something
exceptional, something so inspiring...

897
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:25,197
that they'd want to risk everything
for that passion, but few would act on it.

898
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:28,429
It was very powerful...

899
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:33,017
and it's intoxicating to be
around someone so alive.

900
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:36,041
Come on, just follow me.
They're right nearby.

901
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:37,814
Okay.

902
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,265
Can I ask you a personal question?

903
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:54,184
Look, we're not lost.

904
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:17,089
I've done this a million times.

905
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:21,608
When everything is killing me, I just say,
"Screw it," and go straight ahead.

906
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:32,140
Oh, fuck...

907
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:39,126
Sundial.

908
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:43,262
I'll just set this up,
we'll wait a few minutes...

909
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:46,634
and then we'll be able to tell
which way the sun's moving.

910
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,345
We should be headed southeast.

911
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:57,165
So, you collect anything?

912
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,042
Not really, no.

913
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:02,170
Yeah, well, you know...

914
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:05,090
it's not really about
collecting the thing.

915
01:02:05,194 --> 01:02:08,740
It's about being able...

916
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:13,536
The thing about computers,
the thing I like...

917
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,205
is that I'm immersed in them...

918
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:20,210
but it's not like a living thing
that's gonna leave or die or something.

919
01:02:26,883 --> 01:02:29,803
- John, I'm sorry. I just-
- Okay.

920
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:32,618
- I don't-
- Hey. Okay.

921
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:34,356
Fuck the sundial.

922
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:37,519
I know how to get out of here.
I know how to get out of here.

923
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:40,490
I know this swamp like
the back of my goddamn hand.

924
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:43,323
You're just like everybody else.
Fucking leeches.

925
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,529
You just attach yourself to me
and suck me dry, spit me out.

926
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:51,074
Why don't you get your own fucking life?
Your own fucking interests?

927
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:53,577
Fucking spoiled bitch.

928
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:04,630
Life seemed to be filled with things
that were just like the ghost orchid.

929
01:03:04,665 --> 01:03:09,218
Wonderful to imagine
and easy to fall in love with...

930
01:03:09,739 --> 01:03:12,138
but a little fantastic...

931
01:03:12,242 --> 01:03:14,223
and fleeting...

932
01:03:14,744 --> 01:03:16,621
and out of reach.

933
01:03:28,821 --> 01:03:33,305
" But a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

934
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:14,728
Hello?

935
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:16,848
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

936
01:05:16,952 --> 01:05:19,872
Has it been helpful talking to the writer?
What's her name?

937
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:22,374
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

938
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:26,024
Well, I mean, are you making headway?

939
01:05:26,128 --> 01:05:28,214
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

940
01:05:29,048 --> 01:05:33,115
- You can't rush inspiration.
- Okay. All right. Fair enough.

941
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:36,764
Listen, the other reason
I called was The Three.

942
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,850
It's just amazing.

943
01:05:39,475 --> 01:05:42,082
- I don't know what that is.
- Donald's script.

944
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:46,044
A smart, edgy thriller.
It's the best script I've read all year.

945
01:05:51,988 --> 01:05:55,012
- Good.
- Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

946
01:05:55,116 --> 01:05:57,931
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

947
01:05:58,036 --> 01:06:02,363
In fact, maybe you could get your
brother to help you with the orchid thing.

948
01:06:02,398 --> 01:06:06,690
- Marty, don't say that. I mean-
- All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

949
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:10,340
I mean, he's really
goddamn amazing at structure.

950
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,738
- I have to go.
- All right. Adios, amigo.

951
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,094
Finish that...

952
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:19,933
Fuck!

953
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:31,716
Okay, thank you, thank you.

954
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,601
We have a long three days ahead.

955
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:39,328
Years from now, you'll be at a posh
cocktail party congratulating yourself...

956
01:06:39,432 --> 01:06:45,376
on how you spent a weekend with
an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

957
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,712
- I am pathetic. I am a loser.
- So...

958
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:51,215
what is the substance of writing?

959
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:54,760
I have failed. I am panicked.
I have sold out. I am worthless.

960
01:06:54,795 --> 01:06:57,576
I- What the fuck am I doing here?

961
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,765
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

962
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:04,249
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack
of conviction that brings me here.

963
01:07:04,284 --> 01:07:07,238
Easy answers,
rules to shortcut yourself to success.

964
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,679
And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing.

965
01:07:10,714 --> 01:07:13,911
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes
for attempting something new?

966
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:17,909
I should leave right now. I'll start over.
I need to face this project head-on...

967
01:07:18,013 --> 01:07:21,663
And God help you if you use
voice-over in your work, my friends.

968
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:25,312
God help you.
It's flaccid, sloppy writing.

969
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:30,422
Any idiot can write voice-over narration
to explain the thoughts of the character.

970
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:32,299
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

971
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:39,389
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

972
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:43,351
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

973
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:47,001
You follow? Good.

974
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,712
Anyone else?

975
01:07:53,883 --> 01:07:58,784
What if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens?

976
01:07:58,819 --> 01:08:02,225
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

977
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:06,291
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

978
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:08,481
More a reflection of the real world.

979
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:10,775
The real world?

980
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:12,513
Yes, sir.

981
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:14,807
The real fucking world.

982
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:18,700
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis...

983
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:21,932
you'll bore your audience to tears.

984
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:25,061
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

985
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:28,814
Are you out of your fucking mind?

986
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:31,734
People are murdered every day.

987
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,140
There's genocide, war, corruption.

988
01:08:35,175 --> 01:08:37,955
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world...

989
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,493
somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody else.

990
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:44,143
Every fucking day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision...

991
01:08:44,178 --> 01:08:46,645
to destroy someone else.

992
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:49,148
People find love. People lose it.

993
01:08:49,252 --> 01:08:53,944
Christ, a child watches a mother
beaten to death on the steps of a church.

994
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:55,508
Someone goes hungry.

995
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:59,054
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

996
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:01,973
If you can't find that stuff in life...

997
01:09:02,078 --> 01:09:05,414
then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

998
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:11,462
And why the fuck are you wasting
my two precious hours with your movie?

999
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:14,173
I don't have any use for it!

1000
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:18,136
I don't have any bloody use for it!

1001
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,159
Okay, thanks.

1002
01:09:24,809 --> 01:09:26,373
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1003
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:27,833
No. Thank you.

1004
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:30,023
Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.

1005
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:35,236
This course makes you look at writing
in a whole different way.

1006
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:38,677
- Mr. McKee.
- Yes?

1007
01:09:38,782 --> 01:09:42,223
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

1008
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,038
I need more.

1009
01:09:45,142 --> 01:09:48,792
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

1010
01:09:50,147 --> 01:09:51,503
Right. Okay.

1011
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:53,901
- Nice to see you.
- I need to talk.

1012
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,281
Mr. McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

1013
01:09:58,316 --> 01:09:59,705
I don't meet people well.

1014
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,452
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

1015
01:10:02,556 --> 01:10:04,850
What you said was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

1016
01:10:04,954 --> 01:10:08,395
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

1017
01:10:11,315 --> 01:10:12,879
Yeah.

1018
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,346
Well, you know...

1019
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:18,301
I could sure use a drink, my friend.

1020
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:24,349
" But a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

1021
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,330
Then what happens?

1022
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:30,188
Well, that's the end of the book.

1023
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,961
I wanted to present it simply...

1024
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:35,089
without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

1025
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:37,383
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

1026
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:41,554
I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

1027
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:43,222
It was about disappointment.

1028
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:46,872
I see.

1029
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:49,896
That's not a movie.

1030
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:53,650
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

1031
01:10:54,692 --> 01:11:00,114
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

1032
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:03,347
- I'm way past my deadline.
- I'll tell you a secret.

1033
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:07,831
A last act makes a film.

1034
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,897
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

1035
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:15,860
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end...

1036
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:18,258
and you've got a hit.

1037
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:22,707
Find an ending.
But don't cheat.

1038
01:11:22,742 --> 01:11:26,287
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

1039
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:31,084
Your characters must change...

1040
01:11:32,231 --> 01:11:34,942
and the change must come from them.

1041
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:40,468
Do that and you'll be fine.

1042
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:43,909
You promise?

1043
01:11:46,412 --> 01:11:48,810
Mr. McKee.

1044
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:54,545
- Have you taken my course before?
- My brother did.

1045
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:58,194
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

1046
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:00,593
- Twin screenwriters?
- Yeah.

1047
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:04,764
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

1048
01:12:04,799 --> 01:12:07,683
who wrote Casablanca...

1049
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:10,812
- They were twins
- You mentioned that in class.

1050
01:12:11,646 --> 01:12:13,627
Finest screenplay ever written.

1051
01:12:14,148 --> 01:12:15,817
Great writers' residence.

1052
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:18,493
- Donald.
- Hey, how's your trip going?

1053
01:12:18,528 --> 01:12:21,343
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog you?

1054
01:12:21,447 --> 01:12:22,594
Yeah.

1055
01:12:23,116 --> 01:12:26,209
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

1056
01:12:26,244 --> 01:12:31,249
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

1057
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:34,794
That's great, Donald.

1058
01:12:35,003 --> 01:12:37,610
I want to thank you for all your help.

1059
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:39,347
I wasn't any help.

1060
01:12:39,382 --> 01:12:42,197
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

1061
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:45,013
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

1062
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:47,828
It's been a wild ride.

1063
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:50,018
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

1064
01:12:50,122 --> 01:12:51,999
Oh, please!

1065
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,189
Please, Donald?

1066
01:12:54,398 --> 01:12:55,857
Catherine Keener?

1067
01:12:56,796 --> 01:12:59,820
- Catherine Keener's in my house?
- Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

1068
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:02,844
She's so great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

1069
01:13:03,365 --> 01:13:05,555
Yeah. Look...

1070
01:13:06,598 --> 01:13:08,579
I've been thinking.

1071
01:13:11,707 --> 01:13:16,086
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging
out with me for a few days in New York.

1072
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:18,172
Oh, my God, yes.

1073
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:19,423
Yeah?

1074
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:21,891
I was gonna show my script
to some people...

1075
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:25,992
and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

1076
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,599
Of course. I'd be flattered.

1077
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:31,832
Okay.

1078
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:33,813
Thanks, Charles.

1079
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:35,273
Okay, bye.

1080
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,226
So, like, what would you do?

1081
01:13:51,435 --> 01:13:53,520
The script kind of makes fun of me?

1082
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:57,066
- I'm sorry. I was trying something-
- Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

1083
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,421
Good. Okay.

1084
01:13:59,047 --> 01:14:01,132
So, what would you do?

1085
01:14:02,696 --> 01:14:06,242
You and me are so different, Charles.
We're different talents.

1086
01:14:06,277 --> 01:14:07,701
I know. Just for fun...

1087
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,204
how would the great Donald
end this script?

1088
01:14:10,308 --> 01:14:13,332
Shut up. "The great Donald."

1089
01:14:15,313 --> 01:14:17,295
I feel like you're missing something.

1090
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:20,944
- All right. Like what?
- Look.

1091
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,992
I did a little research on the airplane.

1092
01:14:28,973 --> 01:14:32,414
"Sometimes this kind of story turns out
to be something more..."

1093
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:34,882
some glimpse of life that expands...

1094
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:37,801
like those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water...

1095
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:41,381
and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous...

1096
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:44,927
you can't believe there was a time
all you saw in front of you...

1097
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,908
"...was a paper ball and a glass of water."

1098
01:14:47,117 --> 01:14:50,975
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care about flowers.

1099
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,416
- For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
- Well, but for what?

1100
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:58,587
What turned that paper ball into
a flower? It's not in the book, Charles.

1101
01:14:58,622 --> 01:15:01,089
- I don't know. You're reaching.
- Maybe.

1102
01:15:01,193 --> 01:15:05,677
But I think you actually need to speak
to this woman. To know her.

1103
01:15:07,033 --> 01:15:08,701
I can't.

1104
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:12,351
- Really.
- I'll go.

1105
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:14,332
I'll pretend I'm you.

1106
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:16,209
I want to do it, Charles.

1107
01:15:16,313 --> 01:15:20,171
We'll get to the bottom of this.
We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

1108
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:25,385
But you've gotta be exactly me.

1109
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:28,096
I have a reputation to maintain.

1110
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:30,911
You can't be a goofball.
You can't be an asshole.

1111
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:32,997
- I'm not an asshole.
- You know what I mean.

1112
01:15:33,205 --> 01:15:36,072
No flirting. No bad jokes.

1113
01:15:36,107 --> 01:15:38,905
Don't laugh how you laugh.

1114
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:43,215
I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people think I'm you.

1115
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,780
It's an honor.

1116
01:15:48,638 --> 01:15:51,349
So I guess I'll bring out
the big guns now.

1117
01:15:52,496 --> 01:15:54,268
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

1118
01:15:55,415 --> 01:16:01,776
I felt I detected an attraction to him
in the subtext. Care to comment?

1119
01:16:04,696 --> 01:16:07,789
Well, our relationship
was strictly reporter-subject.

1120
01:16:07,824 --> 01:16:14,393
I mean, certainly an intimacy does
evolve in this kind of relationship.

1121
01:16:14,428 --> 01:16:18,981
By definition, I was so interested
in everything he had to say.

1122
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,256
But the relationship ends
when the book ends.

1123
01:16:27,636 --> 01:16:29,930
- Mendacious deceit.
- What?

1124
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,390
Nothing.

1125
01:16:31,911 --> 01:16:33,684
I just have one more question.

1126
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,983
If you could have dinner with one
historical personage, living or dead...

1127
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,651
who would it be?

1128
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:46,092
Well, I would have to say...

1129
01:16:46,613 --> 01:16:49,325
Einstein.

1130
01:16:50,367 --> 01:16:51,723
Or Jesus.

1131
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:55,025
Very good.

1132
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,624
Interesting answer.

1133
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,463
- She's lying.
- What do you mean?

1134
01:17:02,567 --> 01:17:05,487
- What happened?
- Nothing. She said everything right.

1135
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:10,388
- Too right.
- Well, maybe because they're true.

1136
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,952
Did you embarrass me?

1137
01:17:12,056 --> 01:17:14,246
People who answer questions
too right are liars.

1138
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:17,791
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein.
That's a prepackaged answer.

1139
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:21,232
- "Jesus and Einstein"?
- Listen, Charles, I have an idea.

1140
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,422
You'll need to buy me
a pair of binoculars.

1141
01:17:23,457 --> 01:17:25,090
What's "Jesus and Einstein"?

1142
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:28,844
Come on.

1143
01:17:31,555 --> 01:17:32,806
Sing with me.

1144
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:40,001
What the hell
do you need binoculars for?

1145
01:17:41,878 --> 01:17:43,859
Let's go, let's go.

1146
01:17:44,902 --> 01:17:47,300
She hung up the phone.
She's upset.

1147
01:17:47,335 --> 01:17:49,699
Stop watching her.
Leave her alone.

1148
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:51,680
She's crying.

1149
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,434
She's at her computer.

1150
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:57,519
This is morally reprehensible.

1151
01:17:57,554 --> 01:17:59,396
United...

1152
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:01,481
to Miami.

1153
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:04,401
Eleven...

1154
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,321
Fifty-five A.M. tomorrow.

1155
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:11,179
- I thought she was done with Laroche.
- Her parents live in Florida.

1156
01:18:11,214 --> 01:18:13,890
That was no parent phone call,
my friend.

1157
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:15,350
Don't say "my friend."

1158
01:18:15,454 --> 01:18:17,227
A guy entering.

1159
01:18:17,644 --> 01:18:18,999
Handsome.

1160
01:18:22,127 --> 01:18:23,483
Must be her husband.

1161
01:18:24,421 --> 01:18:26,820
She's acting weird
with him, though, right?

1162
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:28,801
Don't you think?

1163
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,162
What's she hiding from him?

1164
01:18:37,768 --> 01:18:40,271
Maybe she's a lesbian
and doesn't know how to tell him.

1165
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,731
What do you think?

1166
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:45,172
Have you checked out
Laroche's porn site?

1167
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:47,222
No. I'm trying to read.

1168
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:49,447
Anyway, I'm gonna look
at the porn site.

1169
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:51,324
Research.

1170
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:54,035
- Don't tell my old lady.
- You mean Mom?

1171
01:18:54,139 --> 01:18:55,808
No, I don't mean Mom.

1172
01:18:58,206 --> 01:19:00,187
I still say we should go
to Miami tomorrow.

1173
01:19:00,222 --> 01:19:01,334
Forget it.

1174
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:03,697
Some of these chicks look okay.

1175
01:19:03,732 --> 01:19:06,026
Hey, guess what.
We're going to Miami tomorrow.

1176
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:10,093
- I said, no.
- I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

1177
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:34,597
What I came to understand
is that change is not a choice.

1178
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:38,768
Not for a species of plant,
and not for me.

1179
01:19:38,803 --> 01:19:42,835
It happens, and you are different.

1180
01:19:44,295 --> 01:19:47,214
Maybe the only distinction
between the plant and me...

1181
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,821
is that afterward,
I lied about my change.

1182
01:19:49,925 --> 01:19:53,575
I lied in my book.
I pretended with my husband...

1183
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,494
that everything was the same.

1184
01:19:56,599 --> 01:20:00,248
But something happened
in the swamp that day.

1185
01:20:03,272 --> 01:20:04,628
Hey, look.

1186
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:08,173
I told you I'd find
the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

1187
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:15,785
It's a flower.

1188
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,122
Just a flower.

1189
01:20:20,477 --> 01:20:22,563
Well, might as well grab it.

1190
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,544
Long as I'm here.

1191
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:34,554
Oh, man.

1192
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:46,128
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

1193
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,582
Look, something I didn't tell you...

1194
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,267
that I want to tell you about the ghost.
Okay?

1195
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:02,708
I think it might help you.

1196
01:21:05,419 --> 01:21:07,191
I'd just started at the nursery.

1197
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:11,154
And I went back one night
to pick up something.

1198
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:33,573
They wanted the ghost
just to extract the drug.

1199
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:36,075
It had been a ceremonial thing...

1200
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,099
but the young guys, you know,
they liked to get stoned.

1201
01:21:39,203 --> 01:21:40,663
So Matthew...?

1202
01:21:41,184 --> 01:21:42,957
- He was one of the guys who-?
- Sure.

1203
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:45,946
Matthew lived on that shit
till they ran out.

1204
01:21:45,981 --> 01:21:50,152
Because there was this one day
he was fascinated by me.

1205
01:21:50,187 --> 01:21:54,705
By my hair and my sadness.

1206
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:57,764
Yeah, well, it does that.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1207
01:21:57,868 --> 01:22:03,707
I mean, I think you'd like it, Susie.
It seems to help people be fascinated.

1208
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,731
You know, I can extract it for you.
I know how. I watched.

1209
01:22:06,836 --> 01:22:09,651
I'm probably the only white guy
who knows.

1210
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:12,466
I want to do this, Susie.

1211
01:22:15,907 --> 01:22:18,201
I'm done with orchids, Laroche.

1212
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,037
- Hello?
- Hi.

1213
01:23:42,141 --> 01:23:43,705
It's John.

1214
01:23:43,809 --> 01:23:46,208
Did you get my package?

1215
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:47,876
John?

1216
01:23:48,919 --> 01:23:50,483
John!

1217
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,194
Johnny.

1218
01:23:55,175 --> 01:23:57,365
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

1219
01:24:03,308 --> 01:24:05,185
Very happy now.

1220
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,271
Well, I'm glad.

1221
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,650
Very happy.

1222
01:24:16,864 --> 01:24:18,532
Will you go like this-?

1223
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,941
No. Keep going.

1224
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,866
No. No.

1225
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:45,643
I'm trying to make a dial tone.
And you have to sustain.

1226
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,354
And then I will join you, and together...

1227
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:51,795
- See, I can't do it by myself.
- Which one do you want me to do?

1228
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,279
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

1229
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:07,089
- That's it.
- We got it.

1230
01:25:07,124 --> 01:25:10,773
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

1231
01:25:13,276 --> 01:25:16,195
Do you ever get
lonely sometimes, Johnny?

1232
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,636
Well, I was a weird kid.

1233
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,973
Nobody liked me.

1234
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:26,727
But I had this idea...

1235
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:31,315
if I waited long
enough, someone would...

1236
01:25:32,358 --> 01:25:34,652
come around and just...

1237
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:39,031
you know, understand me.

1238
01:25:44,662 --> 01:25:46,643
Like my mom.

1239
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:52,274
Except someone else.

1240
01:25:53,942 --> 01:26:00,094
She'd look at me and quietly say.:

1241
01:26:00,928 --> 01:26:02,180
"Yes."

1242
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:06,351
Just like that.

1243
01:26:07,706 --> 01:26:11,460
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

1244
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,769
I wish I were an ant.

1245
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,732
They're so shiny.

1246
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:37,841
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

1247
01:26:39,614 --> 01:26:43,576
That's the sweetest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

1248
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,932
Well...

1249
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,434
I like you, that's why.

1250
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:56,297
Hey.

1251
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:39,153
I don't have time for that.

1252
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:55,003
I'll get a closer look. You wait here.

1253
01:28:02,302 --> 01:28:04,179
No, wait!

1254
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:07,933
I should go.

1255
01:28:08,246 --> 01:28:11,061
I mean, it should be me, right?

1256
01:28:11,096 --> 01:28:12,417
I mean...

1257
01:28:12,938 --> 01:28:14,293
it's my...

1258
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:17,317
- I was, you know-
- Go for it, bro.

1259
01:28:17,352 --> 01:28:19,299
You're the man.

1260
01:29:22,488 --> 01:29:23,948
Rip them.

1261
01:29:24,678 --> 01:29:26,137
Just rip them.

1262
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,372
Darling, I don't know
what's come over you.

1263
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:56,794
You came all over me last time
I was here, as I recall.

1264
01:30:22,758 --> 01:30:25,365
Goddamn!

1265
01:30:25,469 --> 01:30:27,033
Hey! Fuck.

1266
01:30:28,284 --> 01:30:29,605
Get in here!

1267
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,768
Shut the fuck up, now!
Sit the fuck down!

1268
01:30:33,081 --> 01:30:35,375
- Who is that, Johnny?
- Who the fuck are you?

1269
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:37,252
I just-Nobody.

1270
01:30:37,356 --> 01:30:41,214
- I just-I'm just-
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1271
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:44,238
He's that screenwriter.

1272
01:30:45,385 --> 01:30:49,034
- The guy that's adapting our book?
- Yeah.

1273
01:30:52,058 --> 01:30:53,883
Well, that's wild.

1274
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:55,708
It's nice to meet you.

1275
01:30:57,898 --> 01:30:59,670
Hey, dude...

1276
01:30:59,879 --> 01:31:04,050
- Who's gonna play me?
- I don't know that. I should...

1277
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:06,240
Well, I thought I should play me.

1278
01:31:06,344 --> 01:31:07,595
Why-?

1279
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:10,515
- Did he follow me?
- No, of course not. I should go.

1280
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:13,956
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it was nice to meet you...

1281
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,250
but let me give you my number.

1282
01:31:16,354 --> 01:31:19,691
I'm really freaking here, Johnny.
Why is he here?

1283
01:31:20,004 --> 01:31:21,672
Why did he follow me?

1284
01:31:22,089 --> 01:31:25,321
- What does he know?
- I don't know anything about anything.

1285
01:31:25,426 --> 01:31:28,033
- He did see the greenhouse.
- Oh, shit.

1286
01:31:28,068 --> 01:31:29,492
Oh, shit.

1287
01:31:29,909 --> 01:31:32,412
Are you gonna write about this
in your screenplay?

1288
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:34,602
I really don't know what "this" is.

1289
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,773
He's lying.

1290
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:41,484
- Hold him.
- Stay! Just...

1291
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:19,300
We have to kill him.

1292
01:32:19,335 --> 01:32:21,159
- What?
- What are we supposed to do?

1293
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:22,984
- What can we do?
- Sit the fuck down!

1294
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:31,535
Susie...

1295
01:32:31,848 --> 01:32:33,794
you gotta calm down.

1296
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:36,227
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

1297
01:32:36,331 --> 01:32:38,938
- You don't know-
- I can't have him writing about me.

1298
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:43,526
I can't have the whole world,
all the people knowing about us...

1299
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:45,507
and about this.

1300
01:32:47,384 --> 01:32:48,948
Why?

1301
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:51,972
- You ashamed of me, Susie?
- No, that's not it.

1302
01:32:52,077 --> 01:32:54,266
- No. How can you even think of that?
- Well...

1303
01:32:54,475 --> 01:32:57,812
I'm a professional journalist,
and the drugs and...

1304
01:33:00,418 --> 01:33:02,400
We can't kill anyone.

1305
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:04,485
Okay. Okay.

1306
01:33:04,589 --> 01:33:06,675
Then I'll do it.

1307
01:33:06,988 --> 01:33:08,552
By myself.

1308
01:33:08,656 --> 01:33:11,228
- Susan-
- Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

1309
01:33:11,263 --> 01:33:13,974
- I wouldn't tell any-
- Put him in his fucking car!

1310
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:02,565
Turn it off. Just get out.

1311
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:34,055
Run! Run! Go!

1312
01:34:35,724 --> 01:34:37,983
Susan! What the fuck was that?

1313
01:34:38,018 --> 01:34:43,649
- I don't know. I couldn't see.
- Shit. Fuck!

1314
01:34:43,684 --> 01:34:46,255
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

1315
01:35:15,765 --> 01:35:18,371
So it was a guy?

1316
01:35:18,406 --> 01:35:21,986
Yeah. Fat.

1317
01:35:22,021 --> 01:35:24,628
That's all I could tell.

1318
01:35:30,363 --> 01:35:32,935
This is ridiculous.
We're gonna have to split up.

1319
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:38,496
I can't. I can't be by myself out here.
I'm not gonna do that.

1320
01:35:40,477 --> 01:35:43,606
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't think so.

1321
01:35:43,918 --> 01:35:47,776
I don't want to die, Donald.
I've wasted my life. God, I've wasted it.

1322
01:35:47,811 --> 01:35:51,739
- You did not. And you're not gonna die.
- I wasted it.

1323
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:53,824
I admire you, Donald, you know?

1324
01:35:53,929 --> 01:35:57,682
I spent my whole life paralyzed,
worrying about what people think of me...

1325
01:35:57,717 --> 01:36:01,958
- And you, you're just oblivious.
- I'm not oblivious.

1326
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:06,233
No, you don't understand.
I mean that as a compliment.

1327
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,238
There was this time in high school.

1328
01:36:11,342 --> 01:36:14,435
I was watching you out
the library window...

1329
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:18,328
- ...you were talking to Sarah Marsh.
- Oh, God, I was so in love with her.

1330
01:36:18,433 --> 01:36:23,751
I know. And you were flirting with her,
and she was being really sweet to you.

1331
01:36:23,786 --> 01:36:27,713
- I remember that.
- And then, when you walked away...

1332
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,363
she started making fun of you
with Kim Canetti.

1333
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:36,889
And it was like
they were laughing at me.

1334
01:36:38,557 --> 01:36:40,851
You didn't know at all?

1335
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:46,795
- You seemed so happy.
- I knew. I heard them.

1336
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:49,923
Well, how come you were so happy?

1337
01:36:51,696 --> 01:36:54,407
I loved Sarah, Charles.

1338
01:36:55,867 --> 01:37:00,976
It was mine, that love.

1339
01:37:02,436 --> 01:37:04,521
I owned it.

1340
01:37:07,232 --> 01:37:11,091
Even Sarah didn't have
the right to take it away.

1341
01:37:12,759 --> 01:37:15,679
I can love whoever I want.

1342
01:37:17,973 --> 01:37:20,684
But she thought you were pathetic.

1343
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:27,670
That was her business, not mine.

1344
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:35,803
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1345
01:37:37,889 --> 01:37:41,225
That's what I decided a long time ago.

1346
01:37:54,364 --> 01:37:56,345
What's up?

1347
01:37:58,222 --> 01:38:00,307
Thank you.

1348
01:38:01,454 --> 01:38:03,748
For what?

1349
01:38:13,029 --> 01:38:15,323
No, shh!

1350
01:38:15,531 --> 01:38:18,347
Listen. I hear them.

1351
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:21,892
I hear them. I hear them breathing.

1352
01:38:27,418 --> 01:38:29,921
Charlie?

1353
01:38:30,964 --> 01:38:33,779
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

1354
01:38:33,814 --> 01:38:36,490
- Guys?
- Charlie!

1355
01:38:36,594 --> 01:38:38,367
Charlie!

1356
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:13,611
Where's the van?

1357
01:39:14,654 --> 01:39:19,659
- Are they gone?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1358
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:49,898
John? John!

1359
01:39:58,449 --> 01:39:59,908
Shit!

1360
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:23,891
I can't believe I got shot.
Isn't that fucked up?

1361
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,185
Shut up. Stop laughing.

1362
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:58,718
Donald? You're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

1363
01:40:59,031 --> 01:41:03,515
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't
go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

1364
01:41:03,828 --> 01:41:06,295
Look at me, Donald.
Keep looking at me.

1365
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:09,823
Open your eyes.
Donald, please open your eyes.

1366
01:41:09,858 --> 01:41:13,317
Donald. Donald, please
open your eyes, Donald.

1367
01:41:13,421 --> 01:41:16,445
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

1368
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:39,802
Look at me.

1369
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,339
Help!

1370
01:42:04,723 --> 01:42:06,183
John!

1371
01:42:37,465 --> 01:42:39,029
Halt!

1372
01:43:08,955 --> 01:43:11,319
I'm sorry.

1373
01:43:11,354 --> 01:43:14,065
Now I have to do this too.

1374
01:43:14,899 --> 01:43:17,297
I'm not a killer.

1375
01:43:19,278 --> 01:43:20,530
You put yourself in...

1376
01:43:25,847 --> 01:43:27,307
Johnny!

1377
01:43:30,123 --> 01:43:32,104
- Help!
- No, no!

1378
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:39,507
Johnny! Johnny! John!

1379
01:43:52,854 --> 01:43:55,044
Oh, no, no, no.

1380
01:44:05,054 --> 01:44:09,642
Oh, God. You fat piece of shit!

1381
01:44:10,893 --> 01:44:13,709
- He's dead, you loser!
- Shut up!

1382
01:44:13,813 --> 01:44:16,628
- You ruined my life, you fat fuck!
- Shut up! Shut up!

1383
01:44:16,733 --> 01:44:22,885
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,
old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

1384
01:44:33,312 --> 01:44:36,544
Oh, my God.

1385
01:44:38,526 --> 01:44:43,844
It's over. Everything's over.

1386
01:44:44,052 --> 01:44:46,450
I did everything wrong.

1387
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:52,498
I want my life back.

1388
01:44:52,603 --> 01:44:57,191
I want it back before it all got fucked up.

1389
01:44:57,226 --> 01:45:01,779
I want to be a baby again.
I want to be new.

1390
01:45:01,987 --> 01:45:05,115
I want to be new.

1391
01:45:37,127 --> 01:45:39,213
Hello?

1392
01:45:41,715 --> 01:45:44,322
- Hello?
- Mom.

1393
01:45:44,426 --> 01:45:49,327
Charles? Charles, is that you?

1394
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:56,939
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

1395
01:46:18,315 --> 01:46:22,799
Donald says,
"That was her business, not mine."

1396
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:26,657
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1397
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:30,098
"I decided that a long time ago."

1398
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:33,122
Kaufman starts to cry.

1399
01:46:33,226 --> 01:46:38,127
He tries to thank his brother,
but he can't put it into words.

1400
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:43,966
- So how you getting on?
- I'm okay.

1401
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:48,658
I miss him, you know?

1402
01:46:51,057 --> 01:46:54,289
- How's the script coming?
- It's good. I'm almost finished.

1403
01:46:54,393 --> 01:46:57,000
I'll be really glad to move on
to something else.

1404
01:46:57,104 --> 01:46:58,773
I'll bet.

1405
01:47:00,337 --> 01:47:02,110
Things okay with you?

1406
01:47:02,214 --> 01:47:07,010
And then in January, David and I went
to Prague. That was a high point.

1407
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:10,243
- That sounds great.
- There's amazing puppet theater there.

1408
01:47:10,347 --> 01:47:12,224
Yeah, I've heard. I've gotta see that.

1409
01:47:12,328 --> 01:47:18,689
And there's this church decorated
with, like, human skulls and bones.

1410
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:22,338
Forty thousand skulls and bones.

1411
01:47:23,068 --> 01:47:25,467
I thought about you when I went there.

1412
01:47:47,781 --> 01:47:51,326
Charlie, I'm with someone.
Why are you doing this now?

1413
01:47:54,872 --> 01:47:56,957
I love you.

1414
01:48:03,213 --> 01:48:07,141
I should go. I have to...

1415
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:11,347
Stuff I have to do.
I'm going away this weekend...

1416
01:48:11,382 --> 01:48:15,309
- Million things, okay?
- Yeah.

1417
01:48:29,282 --> 01:48:31,889
I love you too, you know.

1418
01:48:51,909 --> 01:48:55,193
I have to go right home.
I know how to finish the script now.

1419
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:58,478
It ends with Kaufman driving home
after his lunch with Amelia...

1420
01:48:58,582 --> 01:49:01,293
thinking he knows
how to finish the script.

1421
01:49:01,398 --> 01:49:04,422
Shit, that's voice-over.
McKee would not approve.

1422
01:49:04,526 --> 01:49:07,758
How else can I show his thoughts?
I don't know.

1423
01:49:07,793 --> 01:49:10,991
Well, who cares what McKee says?
It feels right.

1424
01:49:11,095 --> 01:49:13,076
Conclusive.

1425
01:49:13,181 --> 01:49:16,899
I wonder who's gonna play me.
Someone not too fat.

1426
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:20,480
I like that Gerard Depardieu,
but can he not do the accent?

1427
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:24,928
Anyway, it's done.
And that's something.

1428
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:29,864
So.: "Kaufman drives off from
his encounter with Amelia..."

1429
01:49:29,899 --> 01:49:33,201
filled for the first time with hope."

1430
01:49:34,035 --> 01:49:36,121
I like this.

1431
01:49:36,642 --> 01:49:38,727
This is good.
