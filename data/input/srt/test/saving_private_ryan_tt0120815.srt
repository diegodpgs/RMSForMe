1
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:45,381
Dad...

2
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:35,487
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:37,727
Port side, stick.
Starboard side, stick.

4
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:40,138
Move fast and clear
those mortar holes.

5
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:42,994
l want to see plenty
of beach between men.

6
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,939
Five men is an opportunity.
One is a waste of ammo.

7
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,309
Keep the sand
out of your weapons.

8
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,194
Keep those actions clear.

9
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,315
l'll see you on the beach.

10
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,353
Open mortar holes!

11
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:46,082
Over the side!

12
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:54,687
Port and starboard, over...

13
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,456
Jesus.

14
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,865
Thank you...

15
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,644
l said, what the hell
do we do now, sir?

16
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:32,219
Captain Miller!

17
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,299
Captain Miller!

18
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,287
Captain Miller!

19
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,197
Sergeant Horvath!

20
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,468
Move your men off the beach!

21
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,173
Go!

22
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,205
OK, you guys!

23
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,241
Get on my ass! Follow me!

24
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,110
What's the rallying point?

25
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,231
Anywhere but here!

26
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,176
The sea wall!

27
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,796
Move up to the sea wall!

28
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:10,699
Sir, l'm staying!

29
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,868
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

30
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:16,233
This is all we got!

31
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:20,308
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

32
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:23,993
You stay here, you're dead men!

33
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,908
Mama!

34
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,613
Mama!

35
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,910
Stay down! Stay down!

36
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,102
What are you guys?

37
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:57,133
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

38
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,672
Here to set up field operations!

39
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:01,598
Get rid of that crap!

40
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,932
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

41
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:13,227
l'm hit!

42
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,472
Briggs!

43
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:20,828
Get me out!

44
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,558
l'm hit low. God!

45
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,138
Medic!

46
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,170
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

47
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,093
l gotta clear these obstacles
for the tanks.

48
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,673
All the armour's
foundering in the Channel.

49
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:34,004
Orders, sir.

50
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,701
You go somewhere else.
l'm clearing this one!

51
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:37,950
Come on, Briggs!

52
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,294
Medic!

53
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:22,867
Move! Move!

54
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,005
Move! Come on!

55
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,461
Move!

56
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,945
Shore party.

57
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,940
No armour has made it ashore.

58
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,103
We got no DD tanks.

59
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,206
Dog One is not open.

60
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,736
Who's in command here?

61
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,815
You are, sir!

62
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,682
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

63
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,970
You recognise where we are?

64
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:17,460
Right where we're supposed to
be, but no one else is!

65
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,117
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be.

66
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:21,884
Shore party.

67
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,551
First wave, ineffective.

68
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,047
We do not hold the beach. Say
again, we do not hold the beach.

69
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:33,319
Sir, we got the leftovers
from Fox Company,

70
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,273
Able Company
and George Company!

71
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:39,551
Plus we got some Navy Demo guys
and a Beachmaster!

72
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,171
Shore party.

73
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,610
Shore party.

74
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:52,086
Cat-F, Cat-F, C...

75
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,568
- Reiben here, sir!
- Anybody else?

76
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:59,231
Jackson, but that's about it.

77
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,566
Mellish here.

78
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,790
Caparzo!
DeForest's back with Wade.

79
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:07,153
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

80
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:09,356
Wade says he's all used up.

81
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,181
Find somebody you can help.

82
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,594
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

83
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,370
Get his attention.

84
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:20,452
Wade!

85
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,495
Yo, doc!

86
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,970
Wade!

87
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,986
Get him off the beach.

88
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,272
l got it!
We stopped the bleeding!

89
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,910
We stopped the bleeding!

90
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,448
Fuck!

91
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:43,383
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

92
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,421
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

93
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,993
Come on, Wade! lt's Mellish!

94
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,872
Wade!

95
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,826
We found Miller!
Let's move! Let's move!

96
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,940
Oh, God. Oh, God.

97
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:05,117
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

98
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,941
We got scattered
pretty bad, sir.

99
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,897
There's bound to be more.

100
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,638
Not enough. This is not enough.

101
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,928
Dog One exit...

102
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,380
On the right.
Or is it left? Shit!

103
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:19,242
No, Vierville is west of us.
This is Dog One.

104
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,739
They're killing us!

105
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:24,133
We don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

106
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,457
Gather weapons and ammo!

107
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,159
Gather weapons and ammo!

108
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:32,359
Come on,
drag 'em in off the sand!

109
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,776
Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,

110
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,355
where's your BAR?

111
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,220
Bottom of the channel, sir.
Nearly drowned me.

112
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:49,257
Find a replacement.

113
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,202
Bangalores!
Bring up some bangalores!

114
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:57,441
Grenades, grenades!

115
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:59,187
Get 'em over here!

116
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,661
Bangalores up the line!

117
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,823
Bangalores up the line!

118
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:08,188
Heads up!
Bangers coming your way!

119
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,495
Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:11,680
Jackson here, sir!

121
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:12,969
Reiben back, sir!

122
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,951
One more. Give me one more.

123
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,179
Oh, my God, it hurts!

124
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,575
l'm gonna die!

125
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,089
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

126
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:34,292
Oh, my God!

127
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,363
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

128
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,155
Almost got it.

129
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:40,235
Jesus!

130
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,091
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:45,455
Keep it moving. You got it?

132
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:49,116
God! God, help me!

133
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:51,562
You're not gonna die.

134
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:54,391
You're fine. Don't look at it.

135
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:58,212
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

136
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:02,512
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

137
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:18,185
We're in business! Defilade!

138
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,180
Other side of the hole!

139
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:34,877
That's it! Let's go!

140
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,359
lnspected. Morphine.

141
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:45,334
Routine.

142
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,230
Priority.

143
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:56,881
He's gone.

144
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,181
Son of a...

145
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,361
Get in there.

146
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,814
Fuck. l can't move.

147
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,930
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

148
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,399
Two MG-42s and two mortars.

149
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,618
Add 20, left 30.

150
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,906
There's a little defilade,

151
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,245
but it's the perfect position
if we get some armour.

152
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,225
We gotta open up this draw!
Get this draw open.

153
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,302
Reiben, Mellish,
let's get into the war!

154
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,457
Grab some cover and put
some fire on that crew.

155
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:02,504
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk,
get ready.

156
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,005
Covering fire!

157
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,905
Go, go, go!

158
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,058
Goddamn firing squad.

159
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,400
lt's the only way
we can get everybody out.

160
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,961
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!

161
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:34,872
You're next!

162
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:39,317
- Why not hand out blindfolds?
- All we'll do here is die.

163
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,230
Covering fire!

164
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,663
Go, go, go!

165
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,739
Come on!

166
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:48,652
Come on! Come on!

167
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,184
Go, Goddamit!

168
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,118
Jackson.

169
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:05,202
Sir.

170
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,900
See that impact crater?

171
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:08,105
Yes, sir.

172
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:12,346
That should give complete
defilade from that machine gun.

173
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,674
Wait for my command.

174
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:20,988
Go!

175
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:35,684
Captain, if your mother
saw that, she'd be very upset.

176
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,383
l thought you were my mother.

177
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,918
Be not thou far from me,
O Lord.

178
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:49,381
My God, l am sorry
for offending Thee.

179
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:55,325
l detest my sins for having
offended Thee, O Lord.

180
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,525
Listen to me, Lord.

181
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,701
All my strength...

182
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,650
haste Thee to help me.

183
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:25,505
Dog One exit! Right here!

184
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,287
We're in business!

185
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,548
Move! Move!

186
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,713
Reiben.

187
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,253
- Let's go, sarge. Go!
- Reiben.

188
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,933
Come on, Doyle!

189
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:47,964
Sarge.

190
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,655
Flame!

191
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,522
Doyle, do it!

192
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,867
Don't shoot! Let 'em burn!

193
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:28,138
''Comrade?'' You son of a bitch!

194
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,201
Lie down!

195
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,660
Cease fire! Cease fire!

196
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:02,705
Cut it out!

197
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:05,303
Cut it out! Cease fire!

198
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:07,875
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie Three.

199
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,059
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

200
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:14,735
l'm waiting
to tie in my flanks. Over.

201
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:16,350
What?

202
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:22,718
What? l'm sorry,
l can't understand you.

203
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,126
What'd he say? What'd he say?

204
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,117
''Look, l washed for supper.''

205
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,960
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

206
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:54,695
Look at this.
A Hitler Youth knife.

207
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,143
Now it's a Shabbat challah
cutter, right?

208
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:08,953
Keep it moving!

209
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,307
That's quite a view.

210
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,149
Yes, it is.

211
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,637
Quite a view.

212
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,117
''Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

213
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,944
''no doubt you have
received information...''

214
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,228
''Dear Mrs Jensen...''

215
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:58,892
''..the death of your son.''

216
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,681
''..no words
can relieve the grief...''

217
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,056
''We have felt his loss
tremendously.''

218
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:06,108
''He was a fine soldier...''

219
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:07,810
''We were involved

220
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:11,077
''in one of the most important
operations of this war.''

221
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:13,131
''Al held us all together.

222
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:14,933
''He was always
first to volunteer...''

223
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:16,718
''..came to a clearing

224
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:18,465
''where 4,000 troops had passed.''

225
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,043
''Your husband served in a unit

226
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:23,676
''whose dangerous duty is
to place itself beyond...''

227
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,676
''..we all cherish
and hold so dear.

228
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,709
''The loss of Lee and others
like him is a distinct blow.''

229
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,895
''l understand your desire

230
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:36,713
''to learn about circumstances
leading to his death.''

231
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:32,054
Colonel, l've got something
you should know about.

232
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:37,130
These two men died in Normandy.

233
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,125
This one at Omaha beach.

234
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,578
Sean Ryan.

235
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,919
This man at Utah.

236
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,755
Peter Ryan.

237
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:53,738
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

238
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,890
Daniel...

239
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,263
Ryan.

240
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:01,135
The three are brothers, sir.

241
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,135
l've just learned
that this afternoon

242
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,691
their mother will get
all three telegrams.

243
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,293
That's not all.
There's a fourth brother.

244
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:16,141
He parachuted in the night
before the invasion.

245
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,093
He's somewhere in Normandy.

246
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:21,462
- ls he alive?
- We don't know.

247
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:25,479
Come with me.

248
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:12,981
'Goddamit.'

249
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:17,341
All four were in the 29th
Division, but we split them up

250
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,376
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

251
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:22,665
Any contact
with the fourth son, James?

252
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,092
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

253
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,089
That's still deep
behind German lines.

254
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:33,120
There's no way to know
where the hell he was dropped.

255
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:37,689
First reports out of SHAEF said
the 101st is scattered to hell.

256
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:39,726
There's misdrops
all over Normandy.

257
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,431
Assuming Ryan survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

258
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:46,067
ln fact, he's probably KlA.

259
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,068
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

260
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,967
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

261
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:54,716
along our axis of advance,

262
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,580
they're gonna be KlA, too.

263
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,703
l have a letter here...

264
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:27,097
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

265
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,300
So bear with me.

266
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:33,370
''Dear Madam,

267
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:37,358
''l have been shown in the files
of the War Department

268
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,719
''a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

269
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:44,132
''that you are the mother
of five...

270
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,753
''sons who died gloriously
on the field of battle.

271
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,888
''l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

272
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,006
''that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

273
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:05,102
''of a loss so overwhelming.

274
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,685
''But l cannot refrain
from tendering to you

275
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:11,111
''the consolation

276
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:15,748
''in the thanks of the republic

277
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,064
''l pray that
Our Heavenly Father

278
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:24,067
''may assuage the anguish

279
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:28,528
''and leave only the cherished
memory of the loved lost...

280
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,337
''and the solemn pride

281
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,724
''to have laid so costly

282
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,675

283
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,125
''Yours very sincerely

284
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,621
''Abraham Lincoln.''

285
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:02,896
That boy is alive.

286
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,872
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

287
00:36:06,827 --> 00:36:10,667
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

288
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,759
Yes, sir.

289
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:27,569
We expected 32 tanks,
27 didn't make it.

290
00:36:27,694 --> 00:36:31,040
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go in, Captain.

291
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:34,345
lf we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

292
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,041
we'll have an entire division
stuck at Carentan

293
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,078
with its pants
around its ankles.

294
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:41,115
Well, you let me know.

295
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,874
Have Charlie Company hold
Vierville until we get there.

296
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,166
Yes, sir. Runner!

297
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:56,018
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us.

298
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:58,927
They misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind.

299
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,092
What's your situation?

300
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,669
Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

301
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:07,014
We took out towed 88s

302
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,851
here, here...and here.

303
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,613
They'd already gotten
four Shermans

304
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,707
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

305
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,115
These two minefields
are one big one.

306
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,610
We tried going through,

307
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,687
but it turned
into a high-density field...

308
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,101
little bit of everything.

309
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:24,902
Spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, A-200s...

310
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:29,109
the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up.

311
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:33,096
This road here...
they placed Teller mine 43s,

312
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,928
l guess for our tanks...

313
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:38,041
from here
to the edge of the village.

314
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:40,743
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

315
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,115
Resistance?

316
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,075
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

317
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:46,710
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

318
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:49,963
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
von Luck Kampfgruppe.

319
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:52,103
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

320
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:54,358
We turned them over to MPs.

321
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,133
What about our casualties?

322
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:02,337
Well...

323
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,089
the figures...

324
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,682
were 35 dead...

325
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,054
times two wounded.

326
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:13,146
They just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s.

327
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,096
lt was tough,
that's why you got it.

328
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,716
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,087
John...

330
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:25,341
l've got another one for you.

331
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:28,505
- Yes, sir.
- Straight from the top.

332
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:39,102
We're taking a squad to Neuville
on a public relations mission.

333
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:41,139
You leading a squad?

334
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:46,107
Some Private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home.

335
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,479
How come Neuville?

336
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:51,118
They think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops.

337
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:55,004
lt won't be easy finding one
particular soldier.

338
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,784
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

339
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,282
What about the company?

340
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:03,067
We take our pick,
the rest get folded into Baker.

341
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,740
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:07,120
They took away your company?

343
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:11,340
lt wasn't my company. lt was
the army's. So they told me.

344
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:15,101
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

345
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:16,902
Beasley's dead.

346
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:20,184
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

347
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,721
Not that l know of.

348
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:24,057
What about Talbot?

349
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,485
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

350
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:29,106
l'll try to dig up
another interpreter.

351
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,287
Assemble
at battalion motor pool.

352
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,335
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,714
- What we doing?
- Listen up... What?

354
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,084
What we gonna do?

355
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,908
You're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, Caparzo.

356
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,735
You like it in the ass.

357
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,698
Attention!

358
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:46,122
As you were.

359
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:47,912
l'm looking for Corporal Upham,

360
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:50,168
- Timothy E.
- l'm Upham, sir.

361
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:52,852
- You speak French and German?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:53,897
Accent?

363
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:56,866
A slight one in French.
My German's clean, sir.

364
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,529
You're reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

365
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:02,480
We're going to Neuville.
When was this updated?

366
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:04,401
As of 0830, sir.

367
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:05,948
Uh, sir...

368
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,699
These two axes advance south...

369
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,703
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

370
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:15,305
- Yes, Corporal.
- Sir, a LOT of Germans.

371
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,881
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

372
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:21,247
No, l've never been in combat.
l make maps, translate...

373
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,248
l need someone who speaks
French and German.

374
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:25,586
My guys were killed.

375
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,586
But l haven't held a weapon
since training, sir.

376
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:32,023
- Did you fire the weapon?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:34,613
- Then get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:37,934
Sir, may l...

379
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:45,014
May l bring my typewriter, sir?

380
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:50,443
Yes, sir.

381
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:56,617
Thank you very much, sir.

382
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:59,197
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

383
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,900
Take your time, Corporal.

384
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,991
Look on the bright side,
Corporal.

385
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:08,238
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:12,259
For one thing...
you don't need to carry those.

387
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:13,687
You'll need that.

388
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,591
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that...

389
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,527
You want your head blown off?

390
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:20,562
Don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws.

391
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,892
Get the fuck back in formation.

392
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,778
l was wondering
where you're from, that's...

393
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:33,596
Caparzo, is it?

394
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,175
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

395
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,376
Got you.

396
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:40,966
And saluting the captain
makes him a target for Germans.

397
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,422
So don't do it, especially
when l'm next to him.

398
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,180
Corporal, what's
your book about?

399
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,817
- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

400
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:53,540
lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

401
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,578
that develop between
soldiers during war.

402
00:42:55,702 --> 00:42:57,656
Brotherhood?

403
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,524
What do you know
about brotherhood?

404
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,102
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

405
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:04,436
Ask the captain where he's from.

406
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:05,982
Yeah, ask the captain.

407
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:08,070
He'll tell you everything
you wanna know.

408
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:10,956
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

409
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:15,591
Why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?

410
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:18,374
20 degrees.
Anybody wanna answer?

411
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:22,075
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

412
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,947
l got a mother, all right?

413
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,563
l mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

414
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:29,860
Shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother.

415
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:33,006
Well, not the captain,
but the rest of us.

416
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:36,499
''Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die.''

417
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:42,153
What does that mean?
We're all supposed to die?

418
00:43:42,278 --> 00:43:45,156
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

419
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:46,535
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,205
We have orders to follow.
That supersedes everything,

421
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:50,672
including your mothers.

422
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,054
Thank you, sir.

423
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,564
Even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?

424
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:57,343
Especially if you think
the mission's fubar.

425
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,881
What's ''fubar''?

426
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:01,668
Oh, it's German. Yeah.

427
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:03,997
Never heard of that.

428
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:05,546
Sir...

429
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,926
l have an opinion
on this matter.

430
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,979
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

431
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:13,200
Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

432
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:15,987
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

433
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,981
of valuable military resources.

434
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:19,769
Yeah. Go on.

435
00:44:19,895 --> 00:44:21,932
Well, it seems to me, sir,

436
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:25,393
that God made me
a fine instrument of warfare.

437
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:29,525
Reiben, pay attention.
This is the way to gripe!

438
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,572
Continue, Jackson.

439
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:31,957
What l mean, sir,

440
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:37,080
if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of Adolf Hitler

441
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:39,574
with a clear line
of sight, sir...

442
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,026
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

443
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,570
Oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin.

444
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:47,954
So, Captain, what about you?
You don't gripe at all?

445
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:50,963
l don't gripe to you,
Reiben. l'm a captain.

446
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:54,230
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down.

447
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:59,047
You gripe to me, l gripe
to my superiors and so on.

448
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:02,998
l don't gripe to you
or in front of you.

449
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:04,960
l'm sorry, sir, but, uh...

450
00:45:05,086 --> 00:45:09,577
Let's say you weren't a captain.
What would you say then?

451
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:11,001
Well, in that case,

452
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:13,975
l'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,

453
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:15,966
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,

454
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,585
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.

455
00:45:18,713 --> 00:45:21,162
Moreover...l feel
heartfelt sorrow

456
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:23,948
for the mother
of Private James Ryan

457
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:28,335
and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

458
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,520
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

459
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,110
- He's good.
- l love him.

460
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:46,554
Right.

461
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,150
Thunder!

462
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:31,574
Flash!

463
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:32,957
Upham, over there.

464
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:35,044
Reiben, you four go.

465
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:46,276
Go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:53,371
You're a welcome sight.

467
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:54,956
Our relief showed up.

468
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,573
How many are you?

469
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:59,068
Just eight. We're not
your relief. Sorry.

470
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,939
What do you mean, sir?

471
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:02,976
We're here for a Private Ryan.

472
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:04,769
Who? Ryan? What for?

473
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:07,277
- ls he here?
- l don't know.

474
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:13,343
Maybe on the other side of town.
The Germans cut us in two.

475
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:17,168
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

476
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:18,582
He dropped in with 101st.

477
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:21,369
- Goldman, get me a runner.
- Runner!

478
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:22,782
Come on.

479
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,000
Jonesy, make a hole there!

480
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,984
We got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward.

481
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,933
The Germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day.

482
00:47:37,058 --> 00:47:39,427
lt's been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

483
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:42,921
Most of the German fire
is concentrated to the westward.

484
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:44,545
Who's on the loudspeaker?

485
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,965
That's Dagwood Düsseldorf,

486
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,764
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

487
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:50,940
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

488
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:54,580
''The Statue of Liberty
is kaputt.''

489
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:56,198
That's disconcerting.

490
00:47:59,484 --> 00:48:00,938
Take the second left...

491
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:04,936
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

492
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:07,944
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with 101 .

493
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:09,950
- Got that?
- Cover!

494
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:18,790
Go!

495
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,232
Those sadistic fuckin' animals!

496
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:45,276
Get down.

497
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:48,536
They know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners.

498
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:50,125
Why keep shooting him?

499
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:52,974
Long as he lives,
he carries the message.

500
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,558
- We'd do the same.
- We wouldn't!

501
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,215
- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,581
Try again to let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

503
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:03,953
What's the rest
of Neuville like?

504
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:07,925
Uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides.

505
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:11,313
A lotta windows
and a square on the left.

506
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:13,867
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

507
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:14,992
Yes, sir.

508
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:22,528
Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

509
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:25,570
Try a left hook.
Two of yours, two of mine.

510
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,703
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

511
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,380
Reiben, Caparzo.

512
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:32,305
Fundamentals. Short runs.

513
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,813
High and low at the corners.

514
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,179
Be prepared for close contact.

515
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:40,546
Go. Upham,
stay with Sergeant Horvath.

516
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:41,753
Stay right here.

517
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,541
l'll wear him like underwear!

518
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:44,706
Stay with me.

519
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,152
Past the end
are the gates to the square.

520
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:57,234
Good.

521
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:06,726
Reiben,
where's the Captain from?

522
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,570
Figure that out,
you got yourself a prize.

523
00:50:09,696 --> 00:50:10,994
300 bucks, l heard.

524
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,717
Company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

525
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,493
Easy.

526
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,882
lt's around this corner.
Defilade up to those gates.

527
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:28,853
Somebody must know
where he's from.

528
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:32,368
Been with him since Kasserine
Pass, and l don't know.

529
00:50:32,495 --> 00:50:34,002
My ankles are killing me.

530
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:36,952
l'll need a wheelchair
before this is over.

531
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,572
Ow! That's it. Oh, my God.

532
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:41,568
Got ankles like an old woman.

533
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:42,939
Like an old...

534
00:50:46,107 --> 00:50:47,360
Reiben.

535
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:49,579
So you don't even know
where he went to school?

536
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:51,588
Captain didn't go to school,

537
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,517
they assembled him
out of Gl body parts.

538
00:50:54,642 --> 00:50:55,968
Pay attention to detail.

539
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:59,543
l know where he's from 'cause
l pay attention to detail.

540
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:00,956
Hey, Upham...

541
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,660
careful you don't step
in the bullshit.

542
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:09,928
Do it.

543
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:10,973
Thunder!

544
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:13,568
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

545
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:25,927
Upham, tell them
to show themselves.

546
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:41,734
Ask where the Germans are.

547
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:47,527
What's he saying?

548
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:48,909
The children.

549
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,080
Take the children.

550
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:52,676
No, we can't take the kids.

551
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:56,757
We can't take the kids! No!

552
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:01,913
They think
they'll be safe with us.

553
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,701
lt's not gonna be safe with us!

554
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:07,522
Are you nuts?!
Listen to the Captain!

555
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:10,034
They think
they'll be safe, sir.

556
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,000
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

557
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:14,968
Put that kid back!

558
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,371
Put that little girl back!

559
00:52:20,495 --> 00:52:22,532
Caparzo,
give that kid back now!

560
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:25,362
Upham, how do you say
''lt's OK''?

561
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,577
She reminds me of my niece, sir.

562
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:29,546
Get the kid back up there!

563
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:33,480
Captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town.

564
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:34,982
We're not here
to do the decent thing!

565
00:52:35,106 --> 00:52:36,684
We're here to follow
fuckin' orders!

566
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:38,765
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

567
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,895
Cover! Cover!

568
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:51,628
Come on. No!

569
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,678
Goddamit!
Where'd that come from?

570
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:58,418
He was on the ground
before we heard.

571
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,780
That's where l'd be.

572
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:09,339
l didn't see it.

573
00:53:09,464 --> 00:53:11,975
450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

574
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,984
l wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!

575
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:16,437
This sniper's got talent!

576
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:24,545
Please don't cry. l'll take you
back to your parents.

577
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,589
Please don't cry. Come on.

578
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:43,393
Captain.

579
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:45,768
Hold on, Caparzo.

580
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,937
Help me up.

581
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,695
l can walk. l can walk.

582
00:53:48,822 --> 00:53:50,518
Caparzo, stay still!

583
00:53:58,482 --> 00:53:59,813
All right.

584
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,802
Two clicks, left wind.

585
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:20,243
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

586
00:54:20,368 --> 00:54:22,529
Wade, you stay put.

587
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:24,026
Where's he shot, Captain?

588
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:28,997
- Can you see him?
- Stay there!

589
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:31,552
Damn it, stay down!

590
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:32,973
What's up with you?

591
00:54:33,097 --> 00:54:36,392
What if you get hit? Huh?

592
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,429
Fish, come over here.

593
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:40,338
Carpy, put your head down.

594
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:42,168
Put your head down.

595
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:53,739
O my God, l trust in Thee.

596
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:56,777
Let me not be ashamed.

597
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,896
Let not my enemies
triumph over me.

598
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,951
Copy it.

599
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:13,419
Copy it and send it for me.

600
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,918
You're gonna send it.
Put it down!

601
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:18,329
- lt's got blood!
- l see it.

602
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:26,149
lt's... lt's to my dad.

603
00:55:26,275 --> 00:55:27,821
lt's got blood on it.

604
00:55:56,259 --> 00:55:57,506
We got him.

605
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,629
Stay down.

606
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:08,517
How bad is it?

607
00:56:08,644 --> 00:56:10,907
Chest, maybe lung shot.

608
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:29,035
Get that 30 up the street!

609
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:35,555
Detail!

610
00:56:35,682 --> 00:56:36,968
Clear up!

611
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,631
Clear down!

612
00:56:53,317 --> 00:56:55,446
That's why
we can't take children.

613
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:05,547
Sergeant Horvath,
do an ammo check.

614
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:08,348
Upham... canteens.

615
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:09,693
Fill 'em up.

616
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:11,993
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:57:12,118 --> 00:57:16,455
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the north-west corner.

618
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:21,509
Mellish, check the tower.

619
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,005
Right now. Go!

620
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:36,243
Fuck Ryan.

621
00:57:47,102 --> 00:57:49,575
- Thunder!
- Flash!

622
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,999
Come on in.

623
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,168
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

624
00:57:58,292 --> 00:57:59,997
Somewhere across the square.

625
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:01,578
Across the square.

626
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:03,946
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

627
00:58:04,073 --> 00:58:06,026
Take it easy. Sit down.

628
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,584
Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

629
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:26,918
What? Up there?

630
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:29,980
How should l know?
Would you go look, please?

631
00:58:30,104 --> 00:58:31,403
Thank you, you moron.

632
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:34,997
All right.

633
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:38,693
You guys just flake out
here for a while.

634
00:58:40,274 --> 00:58:43,019
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

635
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,172
Jesus!

636
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:55,386
Drop your weapons!

637
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:56,589
Drop 'em now!

638
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:57,960
Drop the fucking weapons!

639
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:03,805
l'll shoot you! l'll shoot!

640
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:05,424
Drop! Drop! Drop 'em!

641
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,323
Now! Put 'em down!

642
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:26,999
Clear up!

643
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:33,197
Shit.

644
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:34,827
Shit!

645
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,240
Clear up!

646
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,025
Clear down!

647
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:53,127
Enough to make you old.

648
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:55,672
Let's hope so.

649
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:06,941
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.

650
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:08,953
John Miller, 2nd Rangers.

651
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,091
Thank you.

652
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,433
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

653
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,308
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance you policed him up?

654
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,589
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

655
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:22,669
We lost most of our ammo.

656
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,914
And one of our men.

657
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,336
Lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side.

658
01:00:28,464 --> 01:00:29,558
Yes, sir!

659
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:31,566
And get Ryan up here.

660
01:00:33,112 --> 01:00:34,535
Ryan!

661
01:00:34,658 --> 01:00:36,944
Ryan, front and centre!

662
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:38,690
Ryan!

663
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:43,515
Here comes our boy.

664
01:00:50,933 --> 01:00:53,024
Told you he was an asshole.

665
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,981
Sir, Private Ryan reporting.

666
01:00:57,106 --> 01:00:58,561
At ease.

667
01:00:58,686 --> 01:01:02,137
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

668
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:05,961
This way.

669
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:07,550
All right.

670
01:01:07,675 --> 01:01:09,017
Take a knee.

671
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,820
Private, l have some bad news.

672
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,302
Well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh...

673
01:01:35,182 --> 01:01:38,963
so l'll just say it -
your brothers are dead.

674
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:44,783
We have, uh, orders
to come get you...

675
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:46,363
'cause you're going home.

676
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:03,301
Oh, my God.
My brothers are dead.

677
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:13,413
l was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home.

678
01:02:28,652 --> 01:02:30,124
l'm so sorry, James.

679
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,697
l can't tell you how much.

680
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:35,578
How...how did they die?

681
01:02:35,704 --> 01:02:38,529
They were killed in action.

682
01:02:38,653 --> 01:02:42,744
No, that can't be.
They're both...

683
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:44,946
That...that can't be.

684
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:49,001
My brothers are still
in grammar school.

685
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,684
You're James Ryan?

686
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,441
Yeah.

687
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:57,727
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

688
01:02:57,852 --> 01:03:00,594
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

689
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,643
Well, does that...does that
mean my brothers are OK?

690
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,572
Yeah, l'm sure they're fine.

691
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:13,620
Are you sure they're OK,
though?

692
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:16,659
We're looking for
a different Private Ryan.

693
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:18,530
How do you know?

694
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,776
How do you know the foul-up

695
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,395
isn't that his brothers
are OK and that...

696
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,681
Lieutenant,
l'm sorry for the trouble.

697
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:30,622
l just wrote them a letter...
l got to get home.

698
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:34,386
l got to get home right now.

699
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:36,093
Shh, take it easy.

700
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:38,503
- Where's our Ryan?
- l don't know.

701
01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:40,250
You in touch with your CO?

702
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:43,034
- That figures.
- What unit's he in?

703
01:03:43,158 --> 01:03:44,614
Baker Company, 506.

704
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,908
- The guy with the broken foot?
- Charlie, l think.

705
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,207
You think? Yeah.

706
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:52,059
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

707
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:54,316
Where was your drop zone?

708
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:55,774
Just inside of Vierville.

709
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,765
Vierville?
How did you end up here?

710
01:03:58,890 --> 01:03:59,974
You got me, sir.

711
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,926
C-47 took heavy fire.

712
01:04:02,052 --> 01:04:05,001
Pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way.

713
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:09,095
Took more fire in the drop.
Got messy. l ended up here.

714
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:12,573
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

715
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:16,268
Anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?

716
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:19,927
No, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us.

717
01:04:20,052 --> 01:04:21,879
Show me.

718
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:23,501
My men are beat.

719
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:27,622
We'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark.

720
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:31,649
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

721
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:34,574
Something with clean sheets
and room service?

722
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:36,571
How about a nice comfy church?

723
01:04:36,696 --> 01:04:38,982
- We'll take that.
- Any news?

724
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:40,562
How's it all falling together?

725
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,517
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

726
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:45,343
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

727
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:47,972
We can't pull out
till he's ready, so...

728
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:49,061
That guy's overrated.

729
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,449
No argument here.

730
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:53,292
You got to take Caen
so you can take Saint-Lo.

731
01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:55,379
Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.

732
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:56,999
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

733
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,538
And Cherbourg, you got Paris.

734
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:00,949
Paris, you get Berlin.

735
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:03,029
Then that big boat home.

736
01:05:05,188 --> 01:05:08,110
We sure could
use you around here,

737
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,002
but l understand
what you're doing.

738
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:11,256
You do?

739
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:14,601
Yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself.

740
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:17,012
- Oh.
- Good luck.

741
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:18,223
Thank you.

742
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:19,968
No, l mean it.

743
01:05:20,094 --> 01:05:22,586
Find him. Get him home.

744
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:33,067
What's with your hand?

745
01:05:33,192 --> 01:05:35,446
l don't know.

746
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:40,853
lt started when they brought
us down for embarkation.

747
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:42,394
lt comes and goes.

748
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,672
You may have to get
yourself a new job.

749
01:05:45,796 --> 01:05:48,976
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

750
01:05:54,256 --> 01:05:55,377
What?

751
01:05:59,244 --> 01:06:01,445
- What?
- Nothing.

752
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:04,443
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

753
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:07,519
He was always walking around
on his hands,

754
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:11,546
and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?

755
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:21,376
Yeah, Vecchio.

756
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:23,829
He was a goofy kid.

757
01:06:23,954 --> 01:06:28,121
Remember he used to pee
a ''V'' on everybody's jacket,

758
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:30,307
for Vecchio.

759
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:31,686
For victory.

760
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,107
Vecchio.

761
01:06:35,987 --> 01:06:37,315
He was so short.

762
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:41,265
- Wasn't he a midget?
- How did he become a Ranger?

763
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:46,129
Got shot in the foot once.

764
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:48,639
He could walk faster
on his hands.

765
01:06:50,697 --> 01:06:53,286
He could run faster
on his hands than...

766
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:15,591
You see, when...you end up
killing one of your men,

767
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:18,763
you tell yourself it happened

768
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:25,941
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

769
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:27,988
Maybe a hundred others.

770
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:35,279
Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?

771
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,659
- How many?
- 94.

772
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:42,386
But that means
l've saved the lives

773
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,750
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

774
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:47,813
Maybe even 20, right?

775
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:49,293
20 times as many?

776
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,315
And that's how simple it is.

777
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,547
That's how you...

778
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:03,794
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

779
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:07,051
between the mission and the men.

780
01:08:07,175 --> 01:08:10,094
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

781
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:15,991
This Ryan better be worth it.

782
01:08:19,084 --> 01:08:21,938
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

783
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,926
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

784
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:30,904
l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

785
01:08:31,056 --> 01:08:32,826
Amen.

786
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,087
Look. There it goes again.

787
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:38,494
Sir...

788
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:41,506
are you all right?

789
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:48,902
Look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

790
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:50,790
Why don't you get some sleep?

791
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,614
l don't know how he does it.

792
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:54,972
What's that?

793
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:57,695
Falls asleep like that.
Look at him.

794
01:08:57,818 --> 01:09:00,589
He's lights-out
the minute his head's down.

795
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:02,014
Clear conscience.

796
01:09:02,137 --> 01:09:06,698
What's that saying? ''lf God's
on our side, who's on theirs?''

797
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:10,065
''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''

798
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,570
Yeah, what did l say?

799
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,067
Well, actually,

800
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:16,533
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

801
01:09:16,656 --> 01:09:18,489
How is that, Wade?

802
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:23,240
My mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,

803
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:25,192
slept through the day,

804
01:09:25,317 --> 01:09:29,522
so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home.

805
01:09:29,648 --> 01:09:34,218
So l used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,

806
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:37,708
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,

807
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,828
the faster l'd fall asleep.

808
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:43,071
That wouldn't have
mattered in my house.

809
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:46,484
My ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn.

810
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:49,577
That woman
was never too tired to talk.

811
01:09:49,704 --> 01:09:53,139
Probably the only time
she could get a word in.

812
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:01,796
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

813
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:04,291
and l'd pretend to be asleep.

814
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:07,121
Who? You...your mom?

815
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,374
Yeah.

816
01:10:10,558 --> 01:10:13,406
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

817
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,029
And l'd just keep my eyes shut.

818
01:10:19,361 --> 01:10:23,353
l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

819
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:25,220
that she came home early...

820
01:10:27,595 --> 01:10:30,320
just to talk to me.

821
01:10:32,081 --> 01:10:33,795
And l still wouldn't move.

822
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:36,419
l'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

823
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:47,650
l don't know why l did that.

824
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:03,626
We only got a couple hours.
Go to sleep.

825
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:15,595
Captain? Sir?

826
01:11:17,175 --> 01:11:18,593
Corporal?

827
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,946
How you doin' there?
You all right?

828
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:31,390
Yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir.

829
01:11:31,516 --> 01:11:33,857
Really?

830
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:35,984
How is that?

831
01:11:39,145 --> 01:11:41,805
''War educates the senses,

832
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:43,842
''calls into action the will,

833
01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:47,003
''perfects the physical
constitution,

834
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:50,062
''brings men into such
swift and close collision

835
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:53,454
''in critical moments
that man measures man.''

836
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,248
Yeah, well, l guess
that's Emerson's way

837
01:11:56,372 --> 01:11:58,328
of finding the bright side.

838
01:11:58,452 --> 01:12:02,693
- You know Emerson, sir?
- l know some.

839
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:10,998
So where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

840
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:14,636
What's the pool up to?

841
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:22,042
You know, l think
it's around 300, sir.

842
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,576
Well, when it gets up to 500,

843
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:28,955
l'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?

844
01:12:29,081 --> 01:12:33,021
Well, sir, l feel it's my duty
under your command

845
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:37,148
to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir.

846
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:41,722
What if we don't
live that long?

847
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,602
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

848
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:48,651
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:48,776 --> 01:12:50,121
Yeah.

850
01:12:52,302 --> 01:12:54,013
Get some sleep, Corporal.

851
01:12:54,139 --> 01:12:55,137
Yes, sir.

852
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,146
Who's got sulphur powder?

853
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:08,560
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!

854
01:14:08,687 --> 01:14:09,988
He needs a tourniquet!

855
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:12,086
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

856
01:14:12,211 --> 01:14:14,591
- Do what you can.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,091
Hold on, fellas.

858
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,672
lt won't be much longer.

859
01:14:17,796 --> 01:14:20,252
How we doing here?

860
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:21,705
All right.

861
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:24,160
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

862
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:26,233
Doc's in town.

863
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:27,649
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

864
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:31,678
The 29th lnfantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon.

865
01:14:31,804 --> 01:14:34,104
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

866
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:38,143
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, want to fill me in?

867
01:14:38,269 --> 01:14:39,972
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

868
01:14:40,098 --> 01:14:43,322
99th Troop Carrier Squadron
carrying 327th Glider lnfantry.

869
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:47,146
This one was mine.
l was the pilot. 22 dead.

870
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:51,379
l ended up without a scratch.
Took my co-pilot's head off.

871
01:14:51,506 --> 01:14:53,305
Well, who are these people?

872
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:57,680
The guys we came with,
they headed off first night.

873
01:14:57,805 --> 01:15:01,797
Other guys keep showing up.
One, two, half-dozen at a time.

874
01:15:01,921 --> 01:15:04,831
Then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,

875
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:07,202
head off to make trouble, sir.

876
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:09,214
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

877
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,519
Baker Company, 506 of the 101st.

878
01:15:11,646 --> 01:15:13,028
No, you got me, sir.

879
01:15:13,153 --> 01:15:14,363
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

880
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:16,530
Check that squad.

881
01:15:16,656 --> 01:15:20,438
- See if Ryan's in it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:25,966
Smell that leg right there.
ls it south of cheese?

883
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:33,500
What?

884
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,493
Keep moving. Keep moving!

885
01:15:43,696 --> 01:15:45,481
l'm Juden, you know?

886
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:47,982
Ju-den.

887
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:51,085
Yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there,

888
01:15:51,211 --> 01:15:53,388
- l'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

889
01:15:56,975 --> 01:15:57,929
Stars.

890
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:01,131
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,

891
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:04,017
Deputy Commander, 101st.

892
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,507
Some fucking genius
had the idea

893
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:08,516
of welding steel plates on

894
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:11,533
to keep the general safe
from ground fire.

895
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:13,835
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me

896
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:15,753
until we were getting airborne.

897
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:17,835
That's like flying
a freight train.

898
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:19,041
OK?

899
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:20,455
Gross overload.

900
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,241
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

901
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:26,336
l nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level.

902
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,340
And when...and when we released,

903
01:16:28,468 --> 01:16:32,451
l cut as hard as l could,
tried to gain altitude

904
01:16:32,578 --> 01:16:34,499
and still keep from stalling.

905
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,541
Came down like a fucking meteor.

906
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:39,452
Here's how we ended up.

907
01:16:39,577 --> 01:16:41,574
And the others,

908
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:44,191
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

909
01:16:44,317 --> 01:16:48,228
We were just...we were
just too damn heavy, you know?

910
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,620
The grass was wet.

911
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:53,052
Downward slope and all.

912
01:16:53,177 --> 01:16:55,969
22 guys dead.

913
01:16:58,217 --> 01:17:00,005
All that for a general?

914
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:02,210
One man.

915
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:07,197
- Lot of that going around.
- Fubar.

916
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:08,619
Fubar.

917
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:10,088
Fubar.

918
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,516
Fubar.

919
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,691
Y'all got that right.

920
01:17:14,943 --> 01:17:17,983
l looked in a German dictionary.
There's no ''fubar'' in there.

921
01:17:18,107 --> 01:17:19,148
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

922
01:17:19,272 --> 01:17:21,933
There's more paratroops.
Find out if one's Ryan.

923
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:23,013
Yes, sir.

924
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,086
You might want
to check these out, sir.

925
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,962
Dog tags.

926
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:31,653
More than l really
want to count, sir.

927
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,788
l've...l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

928
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,000
Jackson...

929
01:17:37,123 --> 01:17:38,578
start going through those.

930
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:39,659
Yes, sir.

931
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,070
l'll help.

932
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:47,016
What do you think? He in there?

933
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,320
lf he is, l'll find him.

934
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:51,205
l bet he is.

935
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:54,343
10 bucks says l nail him first.

936
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:58,052
- Who we got...?
- You don't stand a chance.

937
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:01,627
- You think he's in here?
- Just keep looking.

938
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:03,914
All right. Gary lanico.

939
01:18:04,038 --> 01:18:05,243
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

940
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:07,572
All the Guineas
are buying it, huh?

941
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:10,026
Oh, come on,
not the right name.

942
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:12,291
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's your buddy.

943
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:14,591
We gotta find this prick.

944
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,083
Where is this sonofabitch?

945
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,282
Don't mix them up?
Keep them in your pile.

946
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:26,273
How will l know who's here?

947
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:29,161
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

948
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:30,586
Everybody be friends.

949
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,263
Cranky there, huh?

950
01:18:33,728 --> 01:18:35,062
l got a winner.

951
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:36,520
What you talking about?

952
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:37,976
Ryan.

953
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:39,100
Ryan?

954
01:18:39,225 --> 01:18:41,013
Look at that, Mellish.

955
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:44,752
You're a genius, you really are.
R-l-E-N-N-E.

956
01:18:44,878 --> 01:18:48,209
That's Rienne. That's French.
You know what that means?

957
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:49,593
lt means nothing.

958
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:53,992
- Three of a kind.
- All from New York.

959
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:55,576
Do you need
a hand with that?

960
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,076
l got a full house.

961
01:18:57,202 --> 01:18:59,073
Got you beat. Straight flush.

962
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,566
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

963
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:03,728
Ryan.

964
01:19:03,853 --> 01:19:05,429
Fuckin' unreal, this guy.

965
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:06,927
Do you need a hand with that?

966
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,308
Can you read that shit?

967
01:19:08,432 --> 01:19:10,738
Jesus, look at
this poor bastard.

968
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:12,499
They're not bulletproof, huh?

969
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:14,007
Guess not. All right?

970
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:15,506
What's between his ears?

971
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,004
Sort of what you
fellas got between your legs.

972
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:21,539
We got to give him that.

973
01:19:21,664 --> 01:19:23,463
Not bad, Jackson.

974
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:28,000
What the hell are you doing?
The whole Airborne's watching.

975
01:19:28,128 --> 01:19:29,217
These aren't chips.

976
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:32,909
- All right, all right.
- Put 'em back in!

977
01:19:56,907 --> 01:19:58,527
He's not here.

978
01:20:01,316 --> 01:20:02,602
Put 'em back.

979
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:05,511
Maybe we should split
into groups, huh?

980
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:08,219
Wander the woods,
calling his name.

981
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:10,902
He'll hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

982
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:14,710
That might be a little hard
to do, Captain.

983
01:20:14,836 --> 01:20:18,002
Maybe the locals... Hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi.

984
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:20,039
Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?

985
01:20:20,164 --> 01:20:21,703
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

986
01:20:21,828 --> 01:20:23,740
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

987
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:25,940
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?

988
01:20:26,065 --> 01:20:27,856
Private James Ryan from lowa?

989
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:30,705
Anybody know a Ryan?

990
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:31,839
James Ryan?!

991
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:35,683
Hey, Joe, doesn't,
uh, Michaelson

992
01:20:35,808 --> 01:20:38,805
pal around with a Ryan
from ''C'' Company?

993
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:39,970
l think so.

994
01:20:40,095 --> 01:20:42,174
Bring him up here, would you?

995
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:52,524
You know Private Ryan?

996
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:54,073
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

997
01:20:54,197 --> 01:20:56,738
Speak up, sir!
My hearing's not good!

998
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:58,072
lt comes and goes!

999
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:00,274
A grenade went off by me!

1000
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,974
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

1001
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,095
Who?

1002
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:08,846
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?
- Jimmy Ryan?

1003
01:21:08,975 --> 01:21:11,949
James. James Francis Ryan.

1004
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,834
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

1005
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:17,919
Get me a pencil,
something to write on.

1006
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:19,873
Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1007
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:23,989
A small one, sir.

1008
01:21:24,735 --> 01:21:26,104
Write this down.

1009
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,939
James Francis Ryan,
question mark.

1010
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,330
lowa, question mark.

1011
01:21:30,454 --> 01:21:32,549
Do you know know him?

1012
01:21:32,678 --> 01:21:33,848
Read the message. Look.

1013
01:21:36,555 --> 01:21:38,661
Yeah. Of course
l know him, sir.

1014
01:21:38,787 --> 01:21:40,283
Where is he?

1015
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:44,815
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:21:44,937 --> 01:21:47,934
We missed our drop zone
by 20 miles,

1017
01:21:48,061 --> 01:21:50,952
ended up by Bumville
or some damn place.

1018
01:21:51,077 --> 01:21:54,219
We were coming here
to the rally point,

1019
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:57,552
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1020
01:21:57,678 --> 01:22:00,919
- to go to, uh...Ramelle...
- Ramelle.

1021
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:03,790
Babysitting a bridge.
That's all l know, sir.

1022
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,534
Great! Great!
Thank...thank you.

1023
01:22:05,658 --> 01:22:07,696
Write ''thank you.''
Read, and thank you.

1024
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,035
You're welcome!

1025
01:22:09,164 --> 01:22:10,294
Assemble on me.

1026
01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:14,109
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1027
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:19,438
Ramelle.

1028
01:22:19,563 --> 01:22:22,804
We're here. There.

1029
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,969
Ramelle...

1030
01:22:24,094 --> 01:22:28,003
is on the Merderet river,
just south-west of us.

1031
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:31,819
You know anything about
this bridge, Captain?

1032
01:22:31,943 --> 01:22:35,288
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1033
01:22:35,413 --> 01:22:39,077
We can't push on Paris
without a deep water port,

1034
01:22:39,202 --> 01:22:40,741
Rommel knows that,

1035
01:22:40,865 --> 01:22:45,285
so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river.

1036
01:22:45,412 --> 01:22:50,340
Then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to Cherbourg.

1037
01:22:50,464 --> 01:22:55,568
That makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate.

1038
01:23:15,914 --> 01:23:17,873
Let's go.

1039
01:23:26,707 --> 01:23:28,461
Captain.

1040
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:08,364
What the hell is that?

1041
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:13,350
A radar site.
Must be out of action.

1042
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:15,562
Looks like there's
something in that...

1043
01:24:15,686 --> 01:24:18,105
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1044
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:20,142
See it?

1045
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:22,095
Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1046
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,125
What is it?

1047
01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:28,503
Machine gun. Probably MG-42.

1048
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:30,892
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1049
01:24:31,018 --> 01:24:33,489
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1050
01:24:33,617 --> 01:24:35,991
No, their patches are 82nd.

1051
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:38,948
l don't know
how fast you guys are,

1052
01:24:39,076 --> 01:24:42,816
but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here.

1053
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:47,928
So, Captain,
let's just go around it.

1054
01:24:48,056 --> 01:24:51,744
l hear what you're saying,
but we can't.

1055
01:24:51,868 --> 01:24:54,964
l'm with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1056
01:24:55,088 --> 01:24:58,757
- We left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1057
01:24:58,879 --> 01:25:02,831
The Air Force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun.

1058
01:25:02,953 --> 01:25:05,030
Uh, Captain...

1059
01:25:05,154 --> 01:25:08,133
We skip it and still
accomplish our mission.

1060
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:10,819
l mean, this isn't
our mission, right?

1061
01:25:10,943 --> 01:25:14,461
That's what you want to do,
just leave it here?

1062
01:25:14,584 --> 01:25:16,584
Let them ambush
the next company?

1063
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:21,120
No, sir, l'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk

1064
01:25:21,243 --> 01:25:22,452
given our objective, sir.

1065
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,818
Our objective is to win the war.

1066
01:25:27,811 --> 01:25:32,297
Sir, l just, uh, l don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1067
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:37,474
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1068
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:02,145
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1069
01:26:02,271 --> 01:26:04,182
Mellish, you hook to the right.

1070
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:06,065
l'll go up the middle.

1071
01:26:06,189 --> 01:26:07,939
Who's going left?

1072
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:15,850
Who's going left?

1073
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,134
l'll do it.

1074
01:26:22,259 --> 01:26:23,463
l'll go left.

1075
01:26:23,589 --> 01:26:25,168
All right.

1076
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:28,835
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1077
01:26:28,959 --> 01:26:30,467
Yes, sir.

1078
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:34,364
We keep pressure on till
he has to change his barrels.

1079
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:38,156
l think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1080
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,231
- l should take the middle, sir.
- The way you run?

1081
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:46,675
- Maybe l should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1082
01:26:46,798 --> 01:26:49,727
Reiben, base of fire.

1083
01:26:57,945 --> 01:27:00,896
Mags and clips where
you can reach 'em, and...

1084
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:03,682
and extra grenades
for the base runners.

1085
01:28:28,185 --> 01:28:30,446
Hill's clear!
Four down and dead!

1086
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:33,882
Upham, grab the gear.
Get up here!

1087
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,950
We need water
and extra dressing now!

1088
01:28:36,075 --> 01:28:38,034
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1089
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,070
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1090
01:28:51,823 --> 01:28:53,333
Son of a bitch!

1091
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,296
Get some sulphur on there.

1092
01:28:55,422 --> 01:28:56,548
Move my legs up.

1093
01:28:56,673 --> 01:28:58,424
More sulphur, Mellish.

1094
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:00,792
You're gonna be all right, doc.

1095
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,290
How's it look?

1096
01:29:02,414 --> 01:29:04,534
Wade, you're going
on a hospital ship.

1097
01:29:04,657 --> 01:29:05,985
More sulphur!

1098
01:29:06,111 --> 01:29:08,695
Put my legs up.
Put my legs up.

1099
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:11,545
l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.

1100
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:13,472
Upham, give me your canteen!

1101
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:17,312
Come on. Come on. come on.

1102
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,602
Put some pressure on it.

1103
01:29:18,727 --> 01:29:21,389
- You'll be OK.
- How's it look?

1104
01:29:21,471 --> 01:29:24,257
- Give him morphine.
- How's it look?

1105
01:29:24,381 --> 01:29:26,973
- All right.
- How's it look?

1106
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:28,516
Here comes the morphine.

1107
01:29:28,642 --> 01:29:32,244
Am l shot in the spine?

1108
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:34,003
- You're OK, Wade.

1109
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:35,548
Am l shot in the spine?

1110
01:29:35,674 --> 01:29:37,466
Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.

1111
01:29:37,592 --> 01:29:39,007
Put some pressure on him.

1112
01:29:39,132 --> 01:29:40,422
Easy, easy.

1113
01:29:40,545 --> 01:29:41,835
Lift him up.

1114
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:47,069
lt's OK, doc. lt's all right.

1115
01:29:47,193 --> 01:29:49,662
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1116
01:29:49,789 --> 01:29:51,420
lt's in the small of your back.

1117
01:29:51,546 --> 01:29:54,101
How big...how big's
the hole in the...

1118
01:29:54,225 --> 01:29:55,979
lt's about the size of an acorn.

1119
01:29:56,103 --> 01:29:57,231
You're fine.

1120
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,138
Put some pressure on it.

1121
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:05,586
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1122
01:30:05,709 --> 01:30:06,790
lt's all right.

1123
01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:09,758
Put some more pressure on it!

1124
01:30:09,886 --> 01:30:12,899
ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1125
01:30:13,025 --> 01:30:14,866
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1126
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,157
No.

1127
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:18,621
Here. l'll put your hand on it.

1128
01:30:18,744 --> 01:30:20,639
Pressure on there.

1129
01:30:20,762 --> 01:30:22,676
Right there. OK? That's the one.

1130
01:30:22,799 --> 01:30:26,910
Oh, my God, my liver!
Oh, my God! lt's my liver!

1131
01:30:27,033 --> 01:30:30,380
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1132
01:30:30,505 --> 01:30:33,230
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

1133
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,028
Oh, shit.

1134
01:30:35,151 --> 01:30:39,530
l could use...l could use
a little more morphine.

1135
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:42,857
More morphine, sir?

1136
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,861
Give it to him.

1137
01:30:52,872 --> 01:30:54,208
Give it to him.

1138
01:30:58,964 --> 01:30:59,956
l don't wanna die.

1139
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:03,531
Here you go, Wade. Here you go.

1140
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,154
There you go. There you...

1141
01:31:08,104 --> 01:31:10,409
Give him another one.

1142
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:19,097
Mama?

1143
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:23,548
Mama?

1144
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:27,368
l want to go home.
l want to go home.

1145
01:31:27,496 --> 01:31:31,052
Mama! Mama! Mam...

1146
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:18,247
Reiben, hold him!

1147
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:40,589
Not yet.

1148
01:32:42,419 --> 01:32:46,381
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1149
01:32:48,046 --> 01:32:51,397
Same thing for
those paratroopers down there.

1150
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:53,575
Strip that stuff.
Check for intelligence.

1151
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,830
Ask if he's the one
who shot Wade.

1152
01:32:56,957 --> 01:32:59,789
- lt doesn't matter.
- lt does matter!

1153
01:33:03,489 --> 01:33:06,146
Shut up with that
filthy Pig Latin.

1154
01:33:07,977 --> 01:33:09,233
Jackson, you're hit.

1155
01:33:12,248 --> 01:33:13,964
Shut up.

1156
01:33:14,091 --> 01:33:17,178
- lt just skinned me, sir.
- Get it dressed.

1157
01:33:17,304 --> 01:33:19,886
You and Sarge
watch the perimeter.

1158
01:33:22,962 --> 01:33:24,706
He says please don't shoot.

1159
01:33:24,829 --> 01:33:26,781
l don't care, Upham.

1160
01:33:28,366 --> 01:33:31,382
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1161
01:33:31,509 --> 01:33:36,650
- This is not right, sir.
- Help him with the bodies.

1162
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:41,062
What is happening?

1163
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:33,350
American.

1164
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,778
l like American.

1165
01:35:43,935 --> 01:35:46,217
Steamboat Willie.

1166
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,093
Steamboat Willie.

1167
01:35:48,216 --> 01:35:50,981
Yeah, Steamboat Willie.
American.

1168
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:03,324
He's says he's not finished.

1169
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,862
That's what you think.

1170
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:17,363
Please...

1171
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:20,859
l like America.

1172
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:23,230
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1173
01:36:23,354 --> 01:36:26,884
Go fly a kite! Cat got
your tongue! Cool beans!

1174
01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:33,578
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1175
01:36:33,703 --> 01:36:35,835
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1176
01:36:43,078 --> 01:36:45,404
l say can you see...

1177
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:49,153
l say can you see...

1178
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:51,077
l...l say...

1179
01:36:57,642 --> 01:36:59,682
Fuck Hitler.

1180
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:03,756
Fuck Hitler.

1181
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,772
Sir, he says
he's sorry about Wade.

1182
01:37:13,897 --> 01:37:16,672
He says he's sorry
about Wade, sir.

1183
01:37:16,799 --> 01:37:18,763
Captain!

1184
01:37:18,888 --> 01:37:21,008
Captain, this isn't right!

1185
01:37:21,132 --> 01:37:23,336
You know this. He's a prisoner.

1186
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:24,956
He surrendered.

1187
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:27,073
He surrendered, sir!

1188
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:39,524
Tell him...

1189
01:37:41,977 --> 01:37:45,965
To march a thousand paces, then
he can take off the blindfold.

1190
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:49,846
We'll be gone, and he turns
himself in to Allied patrols.

1191
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:53,152
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1192
01:37:53,278 --> 01:37:55,034
Can't take him with us.

1193
01:37:55,158 --> 01:37:57,498
Our guys'll pick him up.

1194
01:38:08,144 --> 01:38:10,821
lf he isn't picked up
by the Wehrmacht,

1195
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:12,872
then thrown back
into circulation.

1196
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:17,594
Captain, you just
let the enemy go.

1197
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,345
This is such bullshit.

1198
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:20,758
Y'all got that right.

1199
01:38:20,883 --> 01:38:23,419
Bullshit? This is bullshit?

1200
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:26,659
Shooting prisoners is OK?
lt's against the goddamn rules!

1201
01:38:26,782 --> 01:38:29,747
The rules just walked
off with your friend.

1202
01:38:31,254 --> 01:38:34,642
But l guess that was
the decent thing to do,

1203
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:35,730
huh, Captain?

1204
01:38:43,349 --> 01:38:45,841
Get your gear. Let's go.

1205
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:50,431
You heard him. Gear up.

1206
01:38:50,554 --> 01:38:52,649
The Captain
just gave you an order.

1207
01:38:52,776 --> 01:38:56,037
Yeah. Like the one
to take this machine gun.

1208
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,415
That was a real doozie, sarge.

1209
01:38:58,539 --> 01:38:59,997
Soldier, you're outta line.

1210
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:03,594
Yes, sir, one hell of a call,
to take this nest.

1211
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:06,998
But, what the hell,
we only lost one guy.

1212
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:10,676
l hope mama Ryan's happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life

1213
01:39:10,802 --> 01:39:12,854
is more important than our guys!

1214
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:15,990
But then, we haven't
found him yet, have we?

1215
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:19,117
Get the hell off me!

1216
01:39:19,242 --> 01:39:20,573
Reiben, get up.

1217
01:39:22,985 --> 01:39:25,640
Gear up. Fall in.

1218
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:33,094
l'm done with this mission.

1219
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:42,349
Sir.

1220
01:39:42,473 --> 01:39:46,377
Don't walk away from your
Captain, get back in line.

1221
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:49,256
l'll go to the stockade
if l have to.

1222
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,683
- l won't ask again.
- Captain!

1223
01:39:51,807 --> 01:39:53,065
This is bullshit!

1224
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:54,153
Fall in!

1225
01:39:54,278 --> 01:39:57,742
- You'd shoot me over Ryan?
- No, l don't like you.

1226
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,742
Just let him go!

1227
01:39:59,867 --> 01:40:01,655
Are you letting this happen?

1228
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,567
Captain! You see this?

1229
01:40:03,693 --> 01:40:07,432
- Captain? Sir? Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1230
01:40:07,557 --> 01:40:11,905
- Sir, we have a situation.
- l have a sixth sense, l know.

1231
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:15,085
You don't kill Krauts,
but you shoot me, huh?

1232
01:40:15,211 --> 01:40:19,548
- He's better than you.
- Do it. Put one in my leg...

1233
01:40:19,673 --> 01:40:21,877
l'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1234
01:40:22,002 --> 01:40:23,747
Put your money where your...

1235
01:40:23,872 --> 01:40:26,570
You don't know when to shut up.

1236
01:40:26,695 --> 01:40:27,695
Captain, please!

1237
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:30,162
What's the pool on me up to?

1238
01:40:30,289 --> 01:40:31,376
What?

1239
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:34,678
- You coward son of a bitch!
- l'm waiting, sarge.

1240
01:40:34,805 --> 01:40:38,189
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to now?

1241
01:40:38,315 --> 01:40:40,685
What...what's it up to?

1242
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:43,265
What is it, $300?
ls that it, 300?

1243
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,402
l'm a schoolteacher.

1244
01:40:49,405 --> 01:40:52,378
l teach English composition

1245
01:40:52,502 --> 01:40:55,007
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1246
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:57,807
The last 1 1 years,

1247
01:40:57,931 --> 01:41:00,392
l've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1248
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,749
l was the coach
of the baseball team.

1249
01:41:08,582 --> 01:41:11,131
l'll be doggone.

1250
01:41:11,258 --> 01:41:14,814
Back home, when l'd tell people
what l do for a living,

1251
01:41:14,938 --> 01:41:18,698
they'd think,
''Well, that figures.''

1252
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:22,609
But over here, it's a...

1253
01:41:22,731 --> 01:41:26,175
a big...

1254
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,967
a big mystery.

1255
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:33,195
So l guess l've changed some.

1256
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:36,999
Sometimes l wonder
if l've changed so much,

1257
01:41:37,123 --> 01:41:41,710
my wife will even recognise me
whenever l get back to her.

1258
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:48,395
And how l'll ever be able to...

1259
01:41:48,524 --> 01:41:51,199
to tell her
about days like today.

1260
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:57,262
Ah, Ryan...

1261
01:41:57,386 --> 01:42:00,725
l don't know anything
about Ryan. l don't care.

1262
01:42:00,852 --> 01:42:06,574
The man means nothing to me,
just a name. But if...

1263
01:42:06,702 --> 01:42:09,883
lf finding him
so he can go home,

1264
01:42:10,006 --> 01:42:12,552
lets me get back to my wife,

1265
01:42:12,676 --> 01:42:16,816
well, then...
then that's my mission.

1266
01:42:18,526 --> 01:42:20,361
You want to leave?

1267
01:42:20,484 --> 01:42:24,352
You want to go off
and fight the war?

1268
01:42:26,142 --> 01:42:28,596
All right.

1269
01:42:28,722 --> 01:42:31,712
All right, l won't stop you.

1270
01:42:31,835 --> 01:42:34,054
l'll even put in the paperwork.

1271
01:42:35,644 --> 01:42:40,606
l just know, every man l kill,
the farther from home l feel.

1272
01:44:05,785 --> 01:44:08,952
By memories

1273
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:12,846
Of days gone by

1274
01:44:12,974 --> 01:44:15,583
ln my solitude

1275
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,922
You taunt me

1276
01:44:18,048 --> 01:44:19,217
With memories

1277
01:44:19,342 --> 01:44:22,667
That never die

1278
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:25,450
l sit in my chair

1279
01:44:25,534 --> 01:44:27,697
Filled with despair

1280
01:44:27,821 --> 01:44:29,617
There's no one

1281
01:44:29,742 --> 01:44:33,131
Could be so sad

1282
01:44:33,257 --> 01:44:35,054
With gloom everywhere

1283
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:37,352
l sit and l stare...

1284
01:44:51,137 --> 01:44:52,895
Half-track! Cover!

1285
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:13,075
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1286
01:45:32,964 --> 01:45:34,804
Move on their left flank!

1287
01:45:34,926 --> 01:45:36,139
Take their left flank!

1288
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:38,938
Hold on, make sure they're down!

1289
01:46:00,014 --> 01:46:03,133
101st! We're coming out!

1290
01:46:09,892 --> 01:46:12,738
That was a recon element,
second SS.

1291
01:46:12,862 --> 01:46:17,042
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1292
01:46:19,922 --> 01:46:23,203
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1293
01:46:23,331 --> 01:46:25,280
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, Five-o-first.

1294
01:46:25,406 --> 01:46:27,025
Ryan, First
of the Five-o-sixth.

1295
01:46:27,151 --> 01:46:29,404
PFC Toynbe,
Third of the Five-o-sixth.

1296
01:46:29,527 --> 01:46:31,577
James Francis Ryan?

1297
01:46:31,706 --> 01:46:34,422
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1298
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:49,167
Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1299
01:46:49,292 --> 01:46:52,848
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1300
01:46:54,977 --> 01:46:58,238
They beat the hell
out of us with 88s.

1301
01:47:04,268 --> 01:47:08,681
Sir, if you're our relief,
l'm gonna file a complaint.

1302
01:47:08,805 --> 01:47:10,601
l wouldn't blame you.

1303
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:13,698
Who's your CO?

1304
01:47:13,823 --> 01:47:16,664
lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1305
01:47:16,789 --> 01:47:20,046
The best we can muster now
is a corporal.

1306
01:47:21,209 --> 01:47:23,701
So, what are you guys
all about?

1307
01:47:24,782 --> 01:47:28,318
We're here for him. Ryan.

1308
01:47:28,444 --> 01:47:29,947
Me, sir?

1309
01:47:39,475 --> 01:47:43,033
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1310
01:47:43,158 --> 01:47:45,731
Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct.

1311
01:47:45,857 --> 01:47:48,397
What is this about?

1312
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:53,163
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1313
01:47:59,886 --> 01:48:02,091
Which...which ones?

1314
01:48:04,209 --> 01:48:05,996
All of them.

1315
01:48:12,255 --> 01:48:17,606
Uh...On...on the level?

1316
01:48:18,732 --> 01:48:20,608
Yeah. l'm afraid so.

1317
01:48:20,731 --> 01:48:25,136
Uh...You might want
to take some time with this.

1318
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:28,217
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...

1319
01:48:37,454 --> 01:48:40,953
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1320
01:48:41,081 --> 01:48:43,738
- Which one?
- All of them.

1321
01:48:48,103 --> 01:48:49,480
You...

1322
01:48:51,029 --> 01:48:54,834
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1323
01:48:56,838 --> 01:48:58,843
Well, you're...
you're going home.

1324
01:49:00,594 --> 01:49:03,254
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1325
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,117
Bring me back?

1326
01:49:10,249 --> 01:49:14,471
Corporal Henderson...l don't
mean to leave you short-handed,

1327
01:49:14,595 --> 01:49:16,811
but orders are orders.

1328
01:49:16,936 --> 01:49:18,608
When are you being relieved?

1329
01:49:18,733 --> 01:49:21,232
Sir, we have no way to tell.

1330
01:49:21,355 --> 01:49:24,639
My orders don't include me
abandoning my post.

1331
01:49:24,763 --> 01:49:27,695
l understand that,
but this changes things.

1332
01:49:27,823 --> 01:49:30,133
l don't see that it does, sir.

1333
01:49:31,721 --> 01:49:35,610
The Chief of Staff for the
United States Army says it does.

1334
01:49:35,734 --> 01:49:37,951
Sir, we have
to hold this bridge.

1335
01:49:38,077 --> 01:49:41,823
The 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet

1336
01:49:41,948 --> 01:49:44,193
except two,
at Valognes and here.

1337
01:49:44,316 --> 01:49:47,643
lf the Germans take 'em,
we'll have to displace.

1338
01:49:47,768 --> 01:49:52,070
Private, your outfit stays,
but your party's over here.

1339
01:49:52,197 --> 01:49:54,412
Sir, l can't leave
until reinforcements...

1340
01:49:54,538 --> 01:49:56,794
You got three minutes.

1341
01:49:56,918 --> 01:49:58,841
Sir, what about them?
There's barely...

1342
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,798
Hey, asshole!

1343
01:50:00,922 --> 01:50:05,410
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1344
01:50:09,785 --> 01:50:11,666
Sir?

1345
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:13,048
That's right.

1346
01:50:22,475 --> 01:50:24,385
What were their names?

1347
01:50:24,511 --> 01:50:27,170
lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1348
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,883
Wade and...

1349
01:50:32,433 --> 01:50:33,938
Caparzo.

1350
01:50:46,477 --> 01:50:49,019
lt doesn't make any sense.

1351
01:50:50,356 --> 01:50:54,578
lt doesn't make sense, sir.
Why do l deserve to go?

1352
01:50:54,704 --> 01:50:57,964
Why not these guys?
They fought just as hard!

1353
01:51:02,628 --> 01:51:05,783
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1354
01:51:05,908 --> 01:51:09,282
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1355
01:51:16,078 --> 01:51:18,752
Tell her that when you found me,

1356
01:51:18,837 --> 01:51:22,456
l was here with the only
brothers l have left,

1357
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:26,692
and that there's no way
l was gonna desert them.

1358
01:51:26,818 --> 01:51:29,488
l think she'll understand that.

1359
01:51:29,569 --> 01:51:31,702
There's no way
l'm leaving this bridge.

1360
01:52:15,031 --> 01:52:16,617
What are your orders?

1361
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:22,745
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1362
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:26,150
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1363
01:52:26,276 --> 01:52:28,817
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1364
01:52:28,944 --> 01:52:32,955
l don't know. What do you think?

1365
01:52:33,084 --> 01:52:36,131
You don't want to know
what l think.

1366
01:52:38,179 --> 01:52:40,181
No, Mike, l do.

1367
01:52:42,053 --> 01:52:45,294
Well... part of me
thinks the kid's right.

1368
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:47,621
What's he done to deserve this?

1369
01:52:47,751 --> 01:52:52,108
lf he wants to stay here,
fine, let's leave him.

1370
01:52:53,281 --> 01:52:54,629
Yeah.

1371
01:52:54,755 --> 01:52:56,977
But another part
of me thinks...

1372
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:00,234
what if by some miracle we stay

1373
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:03,274
and actually make it
out of here?

1374
01:53:03,397 --> 01:53:05,676
Someday we might look
back and decide

1375
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:10,221
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1376
01:53:10,344 --> 01:53:17,074
we were able to pull out of this
whole God-awful, shitty mess.

1377
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:21,328
That's what l was thinking, sir.

1378
01:53:21,456 --> 01:53:24,114
Like you said, Captain,

1379
01:53:25,316 --> 01:53:29,652
if we do that...we all earn
the right to go home.

1380
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:35,168
Oh, brother.

1381
01:53:37,843 --> 01:53:41,220
This is everything.

1382
01:53:41,344 --> 01:53:43,545
Two .30-calibre machine guns,

1383
01:53:43,669 --> 01:53:45,250
17 grenades,

1384
01:53:45,374 --> 01:53:47,660
1 1 Hawkins mines.

1385
01:53:47,786 --> 01:53:51,084
You got two bazookas,
but only eight rounds left,

1386
01:53:51,209 --> 01:53:53,049
and assorted small arms.

1387
01:53:53,174 --> 01:53:55,975
An arty round took out
our .60 mortar.

1388
01:53:56,102 --> 01:53:59,611
Might as well be spit wads
if they use tanks.

1389
01:53:59,735 --> 01:54:03,185
- Which they're sure to.
- What you thinking, sir?

1390
01:54:03,310 --> 01:54:04,432
Well...

1391
01:54:04,555 --> 01:54:08,551
l think they're going to try
to whip around the flanks...

1392
01:54:12,228 --> 01:54:15,780
Unless we draw them up
here between these buildings,

1393
01:54:15,904 --> 01:54:19,372
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1394
01:54:19,498 --> 01:54:21,661
- Disable him?
- lf we can.

1395
01:54:21,787 --> 01:54:25,236
Make the tank a 60-ton
roadblock, we'll have a chance.

1396
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,941
Yes, sir,
don't let them mass anywhere.

1397
01:54:28,066 --> 01:54:30,903
Hit hard and fall back
to the bridge.

1398
01:54:31,029 --> 01:54:35,459
Machine gun moving, number two
up high to piss on their heads.

1399
01:54:35,584 --> 01:54:38,049
That would be the idea.

1400
01:54:38,176 --> 01:54:40,327
Jackson?

1401
01:54:40,451 --> 01:54:42,571
lf we can, l'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1402
01:54:42,697 --> 01:54:45,852
- Yes, sir.
- Give you company if need be.

1403
01:54:45,976 --> 01:54:47,851
Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt.

1404
01:54:47,976 --> 01:54:52,153
l'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be OK.

1405
01:54:52,277 --> 01:54:54,033
Parker, job opportunity.

1406
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:56,246
Not the worst idea, Captain.

1407
01:54:56,372 --> 01:55:00,132
But it all depends on knocking
out the tank here, right?

1408
01:55:00,258 --> 01:55:03,126
So how do you
plan on doing that?

1409
01:55:03,252 --> 01:55:04,705
Reiben's right.

1410
01:55:04,828 --> 01:55:07,781
As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,

1411
01:55:07,907 --> 01:55:12,962
what we got here is spit wads,
so how do we stop the tank?

1412
01:55:13,087 --> 01:55:14,757
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1413
01:55:14,882 --> 01:55:18,434
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1414
01:55:18,559 --> 01:55:20,397
Yeah, but with what?

1415
01:55:22,807 --> 01:55:25,050
We could try a sticky bomb.

1416
01:55:25,175 --> 01:55:26,670
Sticky bomb, sir?

1417
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:32,806
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. lt's in the field manual.

1418
01:55:32,934 --> 01:55:35,647
Well, we're out
of field manuals, sir.

1419
01:55:35,773 --> 01:55:37,779
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1420
01:55:37,904 --> 01:55:41,365
Right, you have demolition -
some TNT or composition B?

1421
01:55:41,492 --> 01:55:45,437
l got that bridge wired
with enough to blow it twice.

1422
01:55:45,562 --> 01:55:47,351
You can spare some, then.

1423
01:55:47,476 --> 01:55:50,940
You take
a standard-issue Gl sock,

1424
01:55:51,064 --> 01:55:54,367
cram it with as much
Comp' B as possible,

1425
01:55:54,492 --> 01:55:56,707
rig up a simple fuse,

1426
01:55:56,829 --> 01:55:59,716
then coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1427
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,378
When you throw it,
it should stick.

1428
01:56:02,502 --> 01:56:05,243
lt's a bomb that sticks.
A sticky bomb.

1429
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:10,425
You know a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, tell me.

1430
01:56:10,552 --> 01:56:14,438
This is good. Now we got
to surrender our socks.

1431
01:56:28,376 --> 01:56:29,961
Haul away.

1432
01:56:43,607 --> 01:56:47,640
Select the field of fire.
Cross with the bell tower.

1433
01:56:47,763 --> 01:56:50,143
l can cover 12 to nine here.

1434
01:56:54,446 --> 01:56:56,993
- Easy!
- l got her!

1435
01:57:30,796 --> 01:57:32,302
Here are the mines.

1436
01:57:43,276 --> 01:57:46,057
For being the best we can do,

1437
01:57:46,181 --> 01:57:50,308
that forward machine gun is not
in a terrible firing position.

1438
01:57:52,776 --> 01:57:54,739
And this position right here...

1439
01:57:57,413 --> 01:57:59,503
this is the Alamo.

1440
01:57:59,627 --> 01:58:03,372
They push us back here,
last man blows the bridge.

1441
01:58:03,496 --> 01:58:05,987
We only got a 30-second fuse,

1442
01:58:06,111 --> 01:58:10,512
so that last man better hurry,
or he won't be alive long.

1443
01:58:11,682 --> 01:58:13,314
Captain?

1444
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,818
Where am l during all this?

1445
01:58:15,946 --> 01:58:19,999
Never more than two feet from
me, and that's not negotiable.

1446
01:58:21,416 --> 01:58:23,616
l'll get some ammo. Come on.

1447
01:58:26,647 --> 01:58:27,855
- Upham.
- Yes.

1448
01:58:27,985 --> 01:58:30,027
- Listen, all right?
- Yeah.

1449
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:31,614
- Listening?
- Yes.

1450
01:58:31,738 --> 01:58:36,207
All right, we'll be displacing
and falling back like crazy...

1451
01:58:36,332 --> 01:58:40,344
So be Johnny-on-the-spot
with ammo or we're dead.

1452
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:42,300
- Right.
- Understand?

1453
01:58:42,423 --> 01:58:45,372
- Johnny-on-the-spot.
- You all right?

1454
01:58:45,497 --> 01:58:46,786
Yeah.

1455
01:58:47,911 --> 01:58:50,081
When we shipped out of England,

1456
01:58:50,208 --> 01:58:53,423
l told the supply sergeant
handing out cigarettes,

1457
01:58:53,549 --> 01:58:55,093
''l don't smoke.''

1458
01:58:55,222 --> 01:58:57,183
''l don't smoke.''

1459
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,983
Quite a situation, huh?

1460
01:59:01,107 --> 01:59:03,144
Unbelievable.

1461
01:59:03,268 --> 01:59:04,182
Here.

1462
01:59:04,308 --> 01:59:08,717
Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1463
01:59:08,843 --> 01:59:10,760
Yeah, you got that right.

1464
01:59:13,436 --> 01:59:14,649
Fubar.

1465
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,247
- Yeah, well...
- Fubar.

1466
01:59:20,372 --> 01:59:22,949
lt'll be a real show, huh?

1467
01:59:30,582 --> 01:59:32,340
Take it easy.

1468
01:59:33,634 --> 01:59:35,012
Fubar.

1469
02:00:12,975 --> 02:00:14,604
Who's that singing, sir?

1470
02:00:16,273 --> 02:00:17,653
Edith Piaf.

1471
02:00:19,746 --> 02:00:22,076
What's she so upset about?

1472
02:00:23,197 --> 02:00:24,568
Her lover left her,

1473
02:00:24,693 --> 02:00:28,187
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1474
02:00:29,604 --> 02:00:31,399
That would do it.

1475
02:01:00,606 --> 02:01:01,853
''Even life itself

1476
02:01:01,978 --> 02:01:03,514
''only represents you.

1477
02:01:06,672 --> 02:01:09,467
''Sometimes l dream
that l'm in your arms.''

1478
02:01:09,589 --> 02:01:13,059
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1479
02:01:13,182 --> 02:01:14,810
The chorus.

1480
02:01:14,937 --> 02:01:17,904
''And you speak softly
in my ear...

1481
02:01:19,742 --> 02:01:21,910
''and you say things

1482
02:01:22,033 --> 02:01:24,151
''that make my eyes close,

1483
02:01:26,853 --> 02:01:28,895
''and l find that marvellous.''

1484
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:32,152
Uh, again...Upham, uh...

1485
02:01:32,276 --> 02:01:36,092
to be honest, l...l find myself
curiously aroused by you.

1486
02:01:37,815 --> 02:01:41,239
Marvellous. No, it's...
it's a melancholy song.

1487
02:01:41,363 --> 02:01:45,269
At the beginning, she says,
''And then one day, you left.

1488
02:01:45,392 --> 02:01:49,141
''You left me, and, uh...
l've been desperate ever since.

1489
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:52,565
''l see you all over the sky,
l see you all over the earth.''

1490
02:01:52,689 --> 02:01:56,824
Any more of this, the Krauts
won't have to shoot me.

1491
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:59,206
l'll just slit my own wrists.

1492
02:01:59,335 --> 02:02:01,709
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1493
02:02:01,835 --> 02:02:03,746
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1494
02:02:03,871 --> 02:02:06,694
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1495
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:10,241
What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
said when l left for Basic.

1496
02:02:10,364 --> 02:02:12,787
What, ''Don't touch me''?

1497
02:02:12,912 --> 02:02:15,627
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1498
02:02:15,751 --> 02:02:21,184
She tries things on in my mom's
shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE.

1499
02:02:21,307 --> 02:02:23,966
- Double-E?
- These things are massive.

1500
02:02:24,092 --> 02:02:25,214
Those are big.

1501
02:02:25,337 --> 02:02:28,878
l've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42-D.

1502
02:02:29,002 --> 02:02:32,217
So she's trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,

1503
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:34,011
silk-ribboned,
triple-panel girdle

1504
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:35,849
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1505
02:02:35,973 --> 02:02:39,110
And it's beautiful,
she's just pouring out of it.

1506
02:02:39,234 --> 02:02:41,237
lt's beautiful, and she can tell

1507
02:02:41,362 --> 02:02:45,432
l got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

1508
02:02:45,559 --> 02:02:47,557
And she says,
''Richard, calm down.''

1509
02:02:47,681 --> 02:02:50,100
And says,
''When you're over there,

1510
02:02:50,224 --> 02:02:53,123
''if you see anything
that upsets you,

1511
02:02:53,249 --> 02:02:57,926
''just close your eyes and think
of these. You understand?''

1512
02:02:59,808 --> 02:03:01,766
So l said, ''Yes, ma'am.''

1513
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:17,104
Are you all right, sir?

1514
02:03:17,229 --> 02:03:19,445
Yeah, just keeping the rhythm.

1515
02:03:25,665 --> 02:03:29,583
ls it true you were
a teacher back home?

1516
02:03:29,707 --> 02:03:31,083
Yes.

1517
02:03:31,211 --> 02:03:33,591
See, that's something
l could never do

1518
02:03:33,717 --> 02:03:38,102
Not after the way we treated
our teachers. No, sir.

1519
02:03:40,777 --> 02:03:43,687
l had a thousand kids like you.

1520
02:03:49,304 --> 02:03:51,642
l can't see my brothers' faces.

1521
02:03:52,853 --> 02:03:55,986
l've been trying,
and l can't see them.

1522
02:03:56,111 --> 02:03:58,282
Has that ever happened to you?

1523
02:03:58,410 --> 02:04:01,331
You gotta think of a context.

1524
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:04,986
What does that mean?

1525
02:04:05,113 --> 02:04:08,942
Well, you think about
something specific...

1526
02:04:09,068 --> 02:04:10,611
something you've done together.

1527
02:04:14,581 --> 02:04:18,086
When l think of home,
l think of something specific.

1528
02:04:18,215 --> 02:04:22,010
l think of my hammock
in the backyard or...

1529
02:04:22,134 --> 02:04:27,290
my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1530
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:34,258
Well, this one night,
two of my brothers came

1531
02:04:34,383 --> 02:04:38,058
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1532
02:04:38,185 --> 02:04:41,484
and they said they had
a surprise for me.

1533
02:04:41,609 --> 02:04:45,224
They took me to the barn,
into the loft, and...

1534
02:04:45,347 --> 02:04:47,510
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

1535
02:04:49,137 --> 02:04:52,477
with Alice...Alice Jardine.

1536
02:04:54,813 --> 02:04:59,369
l mean...picture a girl who took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1537
02:04:59,495 --> 02:05:01,789
and hit every branch
coming down.

1538
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:06,714
And...and Dan's
got her shirt off.

1539
02:05:06,798 --> 02:05:09,757
So he's working on this bra,

1540
02:05:09,881 --> 02:05:13,474
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out...

1541
02:05:13,597 --> 02:05:16,605
''Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!''

1542
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,742
And Alice Jardine screams,
and jumps up,

1543
02:05:21,867 --> 02:05:26,897
and tries to get out,
but this shirt's over her head,

1544
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:30,563
and she runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1545
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:34,574
So now Dan is so mad,
he starts coming after us,

1546
02:05:34,699 --> 02:05:38,625
but Alice is there unconscious,
he's gotta wake her up.

1547
02:05:38,752 --> 02:05:41,922
So he grabs her leg,
and he's dragging her.

1548
02:05:42,046 --> 02:05:45,534
And he picks up a shovel
and goes after Sean.

1549
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:50,829
Sean says, ''Why are you trying
to hit me? l did you a favour.''

1550
02:05:50,953 --> 02:05:55,338
And this makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing.

1551
02:05:55,464 --> 02:05:59,601
lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1552
02:05:59,725 --> 02:06:03,556
The thing explodes, and
the whole barn almost goes up.

1553
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:22,672
That was it...Dan went
to Basic next day.

1554
02:06:22,797 --> 02:06:26,702
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1555
02:06:26,828 --> 02:06:28,828
That was two years ago.

1556
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:37,429
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1557
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:39,811
No.

1558
02:06:41,272 --> 02:06:44,971
No. That one l save just for me.

1559
02:07:49,489 --> 02:07:51,117
Enemy from the east.

1560
02:07:52,746 --> 02:07:55,460
He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em.

1561
02:07:55,584 --> 02:07:57,422
Panzer tanks, two of 'em.

1562
02:07:57,547 --> 02:07:59,469
lnfantry,

1563
02:07:59,597 --> 02:08:01,060
50 plus change.

1564
02:08:09,755 --> 02:08:13,761
Disperse! You know what to do!
Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1565
02:08:13,887 --> 02:08:15,598
Upham, get some cover.

1566
02:08:15,722 --> 02:08:17,853
Mellish and Henderson,
lock and load!

1567
02:08:17,978 --> 02:08:19,525
Everybody check your ammo!

1568
02:08:20,737 --> 02:08:22,113
Good luck, Reiben.

1569
02:08:22,237 --> 02:08:24,645
l was born lucky, sarge.

1570
02:08:38,391 --> 02:08:39,689
One in five tracer?

1571
02:08:39,812 --> 02:08:41,815
Yep, and tracers
point both ways.

1572
02:08:41,942 --> 02:08:45,308
Yeah? Check her head space
and she should run.

1573
02:08:53,603 --> 02:08:56,106
Upham! Hustle up!

1574
02:09:45,903 --> 02:09:47,986
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1575
02:09:48,111 --> 02:09:50,528
We don't have
a .30-calibre here.

1576
02:09:50,654 --> 02:09:53,577
Either Mr Mellish
or Mr Jackson needs that.

1577
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:54,745
Yes, sir.

1578
02:09:55,915 --> 02:09:57,251
Upham! Jackson's fine.

1579
02:09:57,376 --> 02:09:58,337
Turn around to Mellish.

1580
02:10:19,961 --> 02:10:23,546
l don't know if they
took the bait, Captain.

1581
02:10:48,592 --> 02:10:50,927
You got any more of that?

1582
02:11:36,589 --> 02:11:38,511
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1583
02:11:43,643 --> 02:11:46,633
lnfantry's moving to the left.

1584
02:11:46,757 --> 02:11:50,093
Half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

1585
02:13:30,576 --> 02:13:32,745
Displace!

1586
02:13:53,784 --> 02:13:55,576
Do it now! Light it!

1587
02:13:55,703 --> 02:13:57,497
You! Light it!

1588
02:14:08,832 --> 02:14:10,832
30 infantry on the right flank!

1589
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:13,503
Get over there and stop 'em!

1590
02:14:13,628 --> 02:14:14,755
Displace!

1591
02:14:26,679 --> 02:14:27,720
Upham!

1592
02:14:43,406 --> 02:14:44,538
Clear!

1593
02:14:46,819 --> 02:14:47,816
Krauts!

1594
02:14:49,858 --> 02:14:50,945
Right flank!

1595
02:15:03,418 --> 02:15:05,126
Sanitater!

1596
02:15:27,756 --> 02:15:30,797
Get down! Get down!

1597
02:15:37,178 --> 02:15:40,169
Upham! Upham! .30-cal! Hurry!

1598
02:15:40,294 --> 02:15:43,883
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1599
02:16:38,687 --> 02:16:41,069
Reversing!
He's still in this fight!

1600
02:16:42,697 --> 02:16:45,620
No, no, Ryan, get down!
Get down!

1601
02:17:22,001 --> 02:17:23,996
- Ryan.
- Get off me!

1602
02:17:24,121 --> 02:17:26,577
- You all right?
- Get off me!

1603
02:17:26,702 --> 02:17:28,661
l'm fine, too, Captain(!)

1604
02:17:28,785 --> 02:17:31,325
OK, both sides!

1605
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:33,370
Get a grenade in there!

1606
02:17:37,087 --> 02:17:38,462
Grenade!

1607
02:17:40,553 --> 02:17:43,430
- 20-mil!
- 20-mil!

1608
02:17:43,555 --> 02:17:45,341
Flak gun. Take it out!

1609
02:17:58,769 --> 02:18:02,069
Heavy weapon below!
l ain't got a shot!

1610
02:18:06,766 --> 02:18:08,558
Pincer move, Parker!

1611
02:18:08,683 --> 02:18:10,103
Targets eight o'clock low!

1612
02:18:10,227 --> 02:18:11,145
Shit!

1613
02:18:11,273 --> 02:18:12,769
God grant me strength.

1614
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:28,697
Come on! Displace!

1615
02:18:28,823 --> 02:18:29,788
Come on!

1616
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:47,880
Cover, Upham! Cover!

1617
02:18:48,008 --> 02:18:49,421
Cover!

1618
02:19:05,791 --> 02:19:07,916
l'm out of .30-calibre.

1619
02:19:10,545 --> 02:19:13,211
Blessed be the Lord,
my strength,

1620
02:19:13,337 --> 02:19:15,631
which teaches my hands to war.

1621
02:19:24,642 --> 02:19:27,182
My goodness and my fortress...

1622
02:19:27,306 --> 02:19:29,473
my high tower
and my deliverer...

1623
02:19:32,808 --> 02:19:35,579
my shield
and He in whom l trust.

1624
02:20:03,734 --> 02:20:05,101
Parker, get down!

1625
02:20:27,154 --> 02:20:29,404
Captain, that 20-millimetre's
killing us.

1626
02:20:29,529 --> 02:20:31,989
We gotta try to flank it.

1627
02:20:32,115 --> 02:20:35,660
Well, let me get over
for the top shot.

1628
02:21:21,892 --> 02:21:24,556
Upham, ammo, Goddamit!

1629
02:22:07,037 --> 02:22:09,788
l'm jammed! l'm jammed!
Got any .30-cal?

1630
02:22:09,913 --> 02:22:11,622
- l'm out.
- Shit.

1631
02:23:52,022 --> 02:23:55,735
l'm out! l need a bandolier!
Anybody got a bandolier?

1632
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:24,742
God! God!

1633
02:24:27,655 --> 02:24:28,822
You stupid...

1634
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:17,063
Let's stop. Listen to me!
Listen to me! Stop!

1635
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:19,528
No! D-d-d-d...Stop. Stop.

1636
02:25:54,885 --> 02:25:57,573
Son of...son of a bitch!

1637
02:25:57,657 --> 02:26:00,372
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1638
02:26:00,498 --> 02:26:01,959
Son of a bitch!

1639
02:26:03,085 --> 02:26:04,959
Son of a bitch!

1640
02:27:23,949 --> 02:27:25,278
l'm out.

1641
02:27:25,402 --> 02:27:26,776
Those .60 rounds.

1642
02:27:28,694 --> 02:27:30,026
We can use them
without the tube.

1643
02:27:30,152 --> 02:27:31,610
How?

1644
02:27:31,736 --> 02:27:35,029
Fuse-arming wire, set back,
heave it!

1645
02:27:50,022 --> 02:27:51,272
Panzer schreck!

1646
02:28:26,175 --> 02:28:28,174
We're going to the Alamo.

1647
02:28:38,224 --> 02:28:40,061
Alamo! Alamo!

1648
02:29:00,033 --> 02:29:02,037
We'll take it! You fall back!

1649
02:29:02,164 --> 02:29:03,622
You be right behind us!

1650
02:29:03,748 --> 02:29:05,703
Soon as we're in business!

1651
02:29:09,786 --> 02:29:10,996
Displace.

1652
02:29:14,369 --> 02:29:15,328
Reload.

1653
02:30:04,867 --> 02:30:06,405
All right, go.

1654
02:30:07,656 --> 02:30:10,407
We're blowing the bridge!
Clear the bridge!

1655
02:30:34,505 --> 02:30:36,801
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1656
02:30:36,925 --> 02:30:40,852
- l just got the winded.
- Get out of here!

1657
02:30:40,976 --> 02:30:43,022
We're gonna blow this bridge!

1658
02:30:45,145 --> 02:30:46,725
Come on, come on!

1659
02:30:51,437 --> 02:30:53,767
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1660
02:32:41,582 --> 02:32:42,540
Captain.

1661
02:32:46,291 --> 02:32:49,333
Captain, where are you going?
Get back here!

1662
02:35:14,991 --> 02:35:16,785
Hang in there, Captain.

1663
02:36:02,032 --> 02:36:03,032
Medic!

1664
02:36:06,614 --> 02:36:07,656
Medic!

1665
02:36:07,782 --> 02:36:09,365
We got a medic?

1666
02:36:15,447 --> 02:36:18,177
They're tank-busters,
sir. P-51s.

1667
02:36:19,472 --> 02:36:21,282
Angels on our shoulders.

1668
02:36:27,542 --> 02:36:28,627
What, sir?

1669
02:36:34,457 --> 02:36:38,422
James... Earn this.

1670
02:36:43,181 --> 02:36:44,849
Earn it.

1671
02:37:14,071 --> 02:37:17,363
My dear Mrs Ryan,

1672
02:37:17,492 --> 02:37:19,911
it's with a
profound sense of joy

1673
02:37:20,036 --> 02:37:24,795
that l write to inform you
your son Private James Ryan

1674
02:37:24,919 --> 02:37:27,374
is well and,
at this very moment,

1675
02:37:27,504 --> 02:37:30,624
on his way home
from European battlefields.

1676
02:37:30,749 --> 02:37:34,747
Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat

1677
02:37:34,878 --> 02:37:38,630
with great courage
and steadfast dedication

1678
02:37:38,754 --> 02:37:41,426
even after informed
of the tragic loss

1679
02:37:41,511 --> 02:37:45,304
your family has suffered
in this great campaign

1680
02:37:45,430 --> 02:37:48,597
to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression.

1681
02:37:48,721 --> 02:37:52,138
l take great pleasure in joining
the Secretary of War,

1682
02:37:52,264 --> 02:37:54,053
the United States Army

1683
02:37:54,179 --> 02:37:56,765
and the citizens
of a grateful nation

1684
02:37:56,889 --> 02:38:00,146
in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness

1685
02:38:00,271 --> 02:38:03,239
with James at your side.

1686
02:38:03,361 --> 02:38:08,051
Nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,

1687
02:38:08,175 --> 02:38:12,596
can compensate you or the
thousands of other families

1688
02:38:12,718 --> 02:38:16,094
who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.

1689
02:38:16,218 --> 02:38:18,932
l share with you
some words which sustained me

1690
02:38:19,056 --> 02:38:23,358
through long, dark nights
of peril, loss and heartache.

1691
02:38:23,483 --> 02:38:26,479
And l quote,

1692
02:38:26,606 --> 02:38:28,480
''l pray that
our heavenly father

1693
02:38:28,605 --> 02:38:31,526
''may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

1694
02:38:31,649 --> 02:38:33,770
''and leave you only
the cherished memory

1695
02:38:33,895 --> 02:38:35,691
''of the loved and lost

1696
02:38:35,814 --> 02:38:38,652
''and the solemn pride
that must be yours

1697
02:38:38,777 --> 02:38:41,449
''to have laid
so costly a sacrifice

1698
02:38:41,533 --> 02:38:43,830
''upon the alter of freedom.

1699
02:38:43,953 --> 02:38:45,954
''Abraham Lincoln.''

1700
02:38:46,078 --> 02:38:48,621
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully,

1701
02:38:48,745 --> 02:38:51,578
George C Marshall,
General, Chief of Staff.

1702
02:39:42,802 --> 02:39:45,927
My family is with me today.

1703
02:39:46,052 --> 02:39:48,304
They wanted to come with me.

1704
02:39:50,575 --> 02:39:52,117
To be honest with you,

1705
02:39:52,242 --> 02:39:55,950
l wasn't sure how l'd feel
coming back here.

1706
02:39:58,371 --> 02:40:02,047
Every day l think about
what you said to me

1707
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:04,172
that day on the bridge.

1708
02:40:05,381 --> 02:40:10,505
And l've tried to live my life
the best l could.

1709
02:40:10,632 --> 02:40:13,753
l hope that was enough.

1710
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:16,924
l hope that,
at least in your eyes,

1711
02:40:18,342 --> 02:40:22,144
l've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1712
02:40:35,519 --> 02:40:36,769
James.

1713
02:40:39,108 --> 02:40:41,281
Captain John H Miller.

1714
02:40:49,785 --> 02:40:52,533
Tell me l've led a good life.

1715
02:40:52,657 --> 02:40:53,740
What?

1716
02:40:54,865 --> 02:40:57,285
Tell me l'm a good man.

1717
02:41:04,421 --> 02:41:06,005
You are.
