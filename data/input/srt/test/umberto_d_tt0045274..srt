1
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,474
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO MY FATHER

2
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,667
RAISE OUR PENSIONS

3
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,836
WE WORKED OUR WHOLE LIVES

4
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:10,359
JUSTICE FOR PENSIONERS

5
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,034
We want an increase!
We want an increase!

6
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,298
We want to be heard.

7
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,747
We're taxpaying citizens.

8
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,446
We're starving.

9
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,522
We're tired of waiting.

10
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,441
We want to see the minister.

11
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,391
We want to see the minister.

12
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:46,542
Silence!

13
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:50,282
You don't have a permit.
You must disperse.

14
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,237
Go home. Go on.

15
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,413
You should be ashamed.

16
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:23,477
The way you treat us is a disgrace!

17
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,588
Go home. Go on.

18
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:39,021
Let's go, old geezers.
Come on.

19
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:06,786
Keep him quiet, for God's sake!

20
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,282
Quiet, Flike.

21
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,735
Scoundrels, all of them!

22
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,323
Quiet or they'll hear you
and arrest you.

23
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,020
I'm not talking about the police.

24
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,063
I mean the organizers of the protest.

25
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,134
They should have gotten a permit.

26
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,535
They wouldn't give us one.

27
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,744
Then we should have stayed home!

28
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:34,966
A 20% increase
would be enough for me

29
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,292
to pay off my debts in a year.

30
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,384
I don't have any debts.

31
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,302
To tell the truth, I don't either.

32
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,751
- This is our chance. We can go.
- Let's go.

33
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,280
Good day.

34
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:10,847
I have no one,
no son or brother, to help me out.

35
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:13,190
I'm just a good-for-nothing old man.

36
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,461
Orazio Valenti.

37
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:17,533
Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

38
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,118
Who can live
on 18,000 lire these days?

39
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,595
My landlady charges me 10,000.
She even raised my rent, that old -

40
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:28,477
Go ahead and say it.
We're both men.

41
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,461
If she's a bitch, she's a bitch.

42
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,065
Do you need a watch?

43
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,206
No, I have a watch.

44
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,284
I don't have it with me,
but it's a very nice watch.

45
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,592
I have two.
That's why I'm selling this one.

46
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
What make is yours?

47
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,271
It's nice.
It has a gold case.

48
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:54,578
Well, here's where I live.
Good-bye.

49
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,881
Good-bye.

50
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,827
Who's done here?

51
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,195
How rude! I'm not finished.

52
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,596
Thank you.

53
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:28,227
Waitress.

54
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,841
Listen to this.

55
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,677
In a store it would cost you
20,000 lire.

56
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:45,654
- How much are you asking?
- 5,000 lire.

57
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,367
My throat feels scratchy.

58
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,886
- Be patient. It'll pass.
- I hope so.

59
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,325
See you tomorrow.

60
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,859
Here we are. He's so cute.

61
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,881
Hey, I saw everything.

62
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,151
Tomorrow I'll kick you out,
and your dog too.

63
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,005
I'll kick you out, I said.

64
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:33,731
You're overreacting.

65
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,891
She'll lose all her customers.
Don't listen to a word she says.

66
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,978
- May I walk with you a while?
- Of course.

67
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,034
You can have it for 4,000.

68
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,688
4,000! That's a lot of money.

69
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,127
But a good watch lasts forever.

70
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:55,574
I don't care.
Look, I'll give you 3,000 lire.

71
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:00,282
There's more than that in here.
It's all in small change, I'm afraid.

72
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:03,797
- I said 4,000.
- It's all in here.

73
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:07,058
Listen, you can take the bag

74
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:11,217
and give it back to me
tomorrow at the cafeteria.

75
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,044
See you.

76
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,501
Spare some change.

77
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:22,636
See you.

78
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,396
Spare some change.

79
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,725
Who's in my room?

80
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,415
Who's in my room?
- How should I know?

81
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,363
What's all this yelling?

82
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:06,074
Be quiet and stop yelling.
How dare you behave like this!

83
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,213
Quiet down and come with me.

84
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,739
Get it through your head.

85
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,137
It's not your room. It's mine.
- What do you mean, yours?

86
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,786
They're dear friends of mine,
just resting for a while.

87
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,165
And why bother making a fuss?

88
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,086
You're leaving at the end
of the month anyway.

89
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,419
Leaving.

90
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:25,873
What a way to treat someone -
kicking him out after 20 years!

91
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,005
Watch me!
Meanwhile, pay your back rent.

92
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,463
I have the money right here!

93
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,260
Stop yelling!

94
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,921
Who's she think
she's going to kick out?

95
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,515
Where would I go?

96
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:49,959
They skin you alive.

97
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,504
They want 20,000 lire for a rat hole,
and then it's full of rodents.

98
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:55,483
- I know.
- Kick me out!

99
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,098
She charges 1,000 lire
an hour for the room, you know.

100
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,737
1,000 lire every time.

101
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,136
- Could you give me the thermometer?
- Yes.

102
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:23,803
Here.

103
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,998
Do you feel sick?

104
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:29,998
Not too hard.

105
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,751
Did you hear the door just now?

106
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,311
She put them in the living room.

107
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,003
She could have done that before.

108
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,475
No, she couldn't.
There were two others in there.

109
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:45,994
The dirty, rotten -

110
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,973
Have you seen all the ants?

111
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,347
Can you see anything,
Mr. Umberto?

112
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,103
No, nothing.

113
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:19,257
You can a little.
Did you know I'm pregnant?

114
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,577
My God.

115
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:25,815
And you say it just like that?

116
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:28,763
How do you want me to say it?

117
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:37,236
- Does she know?
- God forbid.

118
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,894
You can go in now.

119
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,961
Are you sure?

120
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:26,909
Three months, Mr. Umberto.

121
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,003
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

122
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,689
Come see.

123
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,865
Look.

124
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,490
The tall one is from Naples.
The short one is from Florence.

125
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:08,783
- Which one is yours?
- Both of them.

126
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,491
Which is the father?

127
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:16,966
I think... the one from Naples.

128
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:20,136
What do you mean, you think?

129
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:23,014
They both deny it.

130
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,738
Come here.

131
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,809
Come on. She's crying.

132
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:05,399
Answer me!

133
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,487
She's done singing.

134
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,054
Bring me a hot water bottle.

135
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,478
- What are you doing?
- He wants some hot water.

136
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:27,752
Come on.

137
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:29,926
Good boy.

138
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,463
Do you want to play
with the ball, Flike?

139
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:41,766
Come in.

140
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,206
I pay the maid.

141
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:45,921
If you want hot water,
hire your own maid.

142
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,947
I'm throwing your things out
on the 30th.

143
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,765
I'm evicting you.

144
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,513
Kiss the baby for me.

145
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,275
Did you hear me?

146
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,184
Come here, boy.

147
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,803
Good boy, Flike.

148
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,124
Damn these ants!

149
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,103
Ants everywhere.

150
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,054
- What is it?
- Where's the thermometer?

151
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,908
On the dresser.

152
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,903
I have to put it back.
Otherwise, she'll yell at me.

153
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,230
Come here, please.

154
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,963
What do you want?

155
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,905
Take a look.

156
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:31,630
What do I have to do?

157
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,593
Look in my throat and tell me
if you see a white coating.

158
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,367
It's so big.

159
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,414
Is there a coating?

160
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:49,762
She's hoping I'll die,
but I'm not going to.

161
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,667
Take this to her.

162
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,609
That's 3,000 lire.

163
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,935
And get a receipt.

164
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,458
All right.

165
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:40,840
Mr. Umberto.

166
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:45,712
Mr. Umberto.

167
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,997
She says you owe her 15,000,
and it's all or nothing.

168
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:51,884
I've got to go,
or she'll yell at me.

169
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,773
Good evening.

170
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:32,983
How about 2,500?

171
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:37,807
I said 2,000 yesterday,
and I say 2,000 today.

172
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,766
How about 2,400?

173
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,934
They have great sentimental value.
They're practically new.

174
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,873
I've never opened them
because I didn't want to ruin them.

175
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,381
I'm only giving them to you
because I have a fever.

176
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:27,606
Maria.

177
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,946
These ants are driving me crazy.

178
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:32,505
2,000...

179
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:35,541
4,000...

180
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:39,509
5,000.

181
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:41,999
She'll have the rest
when I get my pension.

182
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:50,291
Get me the thermometer.
She's made my fever go up.

183
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,363
15,000.

184
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:57,614
To pay my debts, I'd have to go
a month without food.

185
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,565
Did you do your assignment?

186
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,376
You didn't have time, eh?

187
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:11,393
Certain things can happen
if you don't know your grammar.

188
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:15,207
Everyone takes advantage
of the ignorant.

189
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:08,911
Now there's more. You'll have
to wait till the 27th for the rest.

190
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:13,382
This is ridiculous.
First 3,000, then 2,000 more.

191
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,706
Take them back to him.
It's all or nothing.

192
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:20,705
Either he gives me 15,000 lire
or I evict him. Go.

193
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:32,028
Well?

194
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:45,047
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Go right in.

195
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,577
Excuse me.

196
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,049
What are you doing?
Down there.

197
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:59,283
Madam is at the end of the corridor.

198
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:00,945
Maria, shut the door!

199
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,654
Her fiancé.

200
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:25,419
I was the only successful one
in all Macerata.

201
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:39,206
Good-bye.

202
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:41,636
Till tomorrow.

203
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:45,806
Yes.

204
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,587
What is it?

205
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:55,429
Yes, a cold.
San Martino della Battaglia 14.

206
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,408
Third floor.

207
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:00,899
Thank you.

208
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:25,890
What's going on?

209
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:28,002
Come in.

210
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,672
Stay there. I'll come to you.

211
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:36,064
Who's Mr. Ferrari?

212
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,311
I am.

213
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:40,130
I got dressed
so I wouldn't keep you waiting.

214
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:58,581
Sorry. Umberto Domenico Ferrari.

215
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:00,599
Spalmagulli, Armando.

216
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,869
Please, come in.

217
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,429
I'll just shut my suitcase
and then I'm ready.

218
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,769
Mr. Umberto, are you seriously ill?

219
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:19,112
Yes, it's serious.

220
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,277
Serious.

221
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,807
- You're leaving us in the dark over here.
- Shut up.

222
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:30,851
Are you kidding?

223
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:32,930
What are you looking at?

224
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,663
6:30.

225
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:42,115
Come here. Good boy.

226
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:46,431
If he realizes I'm leaving,
it'll be the end.

227
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:48,449
Down, boy.

228
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,239
Do me a favor.

229
00:36:53,473 --> 00:36:56,701
Play with the dog a little.
Here's a ball and ruler.

230
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,837
I don't feel like playing.

231
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:02,771
I can't say good-bye to him,
or he won't let me leave.

232
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,153
Very well.

233
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:06,873
Go on, boy.

234
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:13,841
- What are you doing?
- Come and play with the ruler.

235
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:19,188
- Is your boyfriend down there?
- Leave me alone.

236
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,139
Mr. Umberto.

237
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,115
Don't give him any milk, all right?

238
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:37,132
And please keep an eye on him.

239
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:38,569
All right.

240
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,275
He's fine. He's playing.

241
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,783
Please take care of him.
I won't forget you.

242
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:52,802
I won't be gone long.

243
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,655
Shall we go, Mr. Ferrari?

244
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,152
Yes.

245
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,372
Give me your suitcase.

246
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,256
No, it's very light.
Just pajamas and a bar of soap.

247
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,815
Keep it, then.

248
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,894
Bye.

249
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:25,835
Maria!

250
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:58,817
This guy's healthier than I am.
What's he doing here?

251
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,983
I'd like to keep him a little longer,
so he can get the full treatment.

252
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:05,857
All right.

253
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:08,668
Thank you, Sister.

254
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:13,939
Say "ah."

255
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:17,364
That's fine.

256
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:21,690
Brush his tonsils with iodine.
You can go home tomorrow.

257
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:23,630
Excuse me, Doctor.

258
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:24,982
What?

259
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,566
I also have a pain here.

260
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:31,954
What kind of pain?

261
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:36,872
Nothing.

262
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,841
Can't you see your fever's gone?

263
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,952
It's just common tonsillitis.

264
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,122
If you were younger, I'd tell you
to have your tonsils taken out.

265
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:49,288
But what's the use, at your age?

266
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:57,065
You should have insisted.

267
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,300
Mr. Umberto,

268
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,507
you should have insisted.

269
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:07,779
I'd really like to save
a little money, you know.

270
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,944
I'll teach you how to get them
to let you stay here.

271
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,097
All I need is one week.

272
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,623
This ward is better than a hotel.

273
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:20,537
Did you ask the nun for a rosary?

274
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:25,778
Thank you. Oh, Sister-

275
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,810
He's such a nice person.

276
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:32,500
He'd like to stay a little longer.

277
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,567
He needs more treatment.
Can't you see how haggard he looks?

278
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,664
Just imagine: His pension isn't
even enough to support his dog.

279
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,544
We'll see.

280
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:48,877
Thank you, Sister.

281
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,246
Ask her for a rosary.

282
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:52,455
Sister.

283
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,268
Could I have a rosary?

284
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,708
How are you, my dear?

285
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,569
I'm fine.

286
00:41:34,012 --> 00:41:35,702
This was all I could bring.

287
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:39,188
A banana!

288
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,741
Sit down, dear.
Pull up that stool.

289
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,137
May I sit here?

290
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:50,414
Of course. Sit down.

291
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,570
What about Flike? How is he?

292
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:57,804
I wanted to bring him upstairs,
but it's not allowed.

293
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,901
He's downstairs in the courtyard.
- In the courtyard.

294
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:04,332
Flike's in the courtyard.

295
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:32,791
Shut that window!

296
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,570
Shut it!

297
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,946
So, is that the father?

298
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:23,073
Mr. Umberto,

299
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:25,540
if you asked me
to swear to it, I couldn't.

300
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:28,254
But I sense it was him.

301
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:31,263
What does he have to say?

302
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,886
Nothing.

303
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:37,434
When I come back, I'll make him talk.

304
00:43:37,506 --> 00:43:39,643
I'll talk to both of them.

305
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:42,329
Even the short one,
the one from Florence.

306
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:43,446
Both of them.

307
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:46,005
Give us another one, Sister.

308
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:55,509
Good morning, Sister.

309
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,197
Your daughter?

310
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:08,711
Excuse me, Sister.

311
00:44:08,786 --> 00:44:10,476
How is our father?

312
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:11,945
He's very ill.

313
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:26,084
So he asked to borrow 4,000 lire,
but I didn't give him a cent.

314
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:27,582
Good move.

315
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:30,626
Yes, she's marrying the manager
of the movie theater.

316
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:32,517
That way she can get in for free.

317
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,931
I hope she doesn't have children.

318
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:38,938
She says you have to leave
because she needs your room.

319
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:40,418
That's why she's getting married.

320
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:42,654
Absolutely not.

321
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:45,466
I'm paying my back rent,
so she can't kick me out.

322
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:46,965
She can't evict me.

323
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,981
Mr. Umberto, he's waiting.

324
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:51,443
I'm not going to the shelter.

325
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:53,426
Get well soon, Mr. Umberto.

326
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,769
- Tell her I'm not going.
- Yes, I'll tell her.

327
00:44:55,836 --> 00:45:00,057
Let her go to the shelter.
I'm not going!

328
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,451
During the war
she called me Grandpa.

329
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:31,938
I gave her some meat
from time to time.

330
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,562
After the war she went crazy.

331
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:37,951
She even hates my dog.

332
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:40,444
If you saw my dog,
you'd know it's impossible to hate him.

333
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:05,072
Take care of yourself, Mr. Umberto.

334
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:08,462
But I'm coming back here, you know.
I'm gonna try again.

335
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:09,519
Good luck.

336
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:12,079
I'll come and visit you.
What's your address?

337
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:15,630
- Via San Martino della Battaglia 14.
- That's where I'll find you, right?

338
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:18,515
- Even the police couldn't get me out.
- That's the spirit!

339
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,718
Good-bye, and good luck.

340
00:47:06,814 --> 00:47:10,107
- Excuse me, isn't the maid here?
- No, but the lady of the house is.

341
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:32,807
What are you doing?

342
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:34,026
I'm working.

343
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:36,103
This is my room. I live here.

344
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:37,895
Who said you didn't?

345
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:40,077
What are you supposed to do here?

346
00:47:40,142 --> 00:47:41,929
A lot of stuff.

347
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,732
Excuse me.
Did the maid go out with the dog?

348
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,748
What dog?

349
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:56,511
My dog!

350
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:59,584
I'm not here
to keep an eye on the dog.

351
00:48:25,144 --> 00:48:27,151
I'm pregnant. You understand?

352
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:35,338
Good morning.

353
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:44,524
- Where's Flike?
- I don't know.

354
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,012
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

355
00:48:47,086 --> 00:48:48,908
Don't make me shout.
Where's Flike?

356
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:51,143
Madam opened the door and he left.

357
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:52,935
Where were you, you fool?

358
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:55,009
I kept the door shut,
but she kept opening it.

359
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:58,376
If anything's happened to him,
I'll kill her.

360
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,107
Please hurry.

361
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:17,623
- What if I run someone over?
- I'll pay the damages. Just hurry.

362
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:28,591
- How much?
- 200 lire.

363
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,520
- Here.
- I don't have change.

364
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,000
Do you have change for 1,000 lire?

365
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:45,617
Could you make change
for 1,000 lire?

366
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,217
Give me that glass.

367
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,302
- This one?
- Yes.

368
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:57,986
Fifty lire. 950 is your change.

369
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,003
- There.
- Thank you.

370
00:50:14,532 --> 00:50:16,800
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my dog.

371
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,296
You're number 15.

372
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:47,914
Excuse me.
Is this where you kill them?

373
00:50:57,648 --> 00:50:59,076
Thirteen.

374
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:09,215
Fourteen.

375
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,966
Fifteen.

376
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:18,782
Sixteen.

377
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:22,242
Fifteen.

378
00:51:26,178 --> 00:51:28,217
- Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye.

379
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:30,779
Yes?

380
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:34,397
A mutt with intelligent eyes.

381
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:37,046
White with brown spots.

382
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:39,091
He ran away from home.
- When?

383
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:42,327
Yesterday,
or perhaps the day before.

384
00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:47,980
What do you wish to do?
Do you want the dog or not?

385
00:51:48,056 --> 00:51:52,364
- What if I don't take him?
- Then we'll have to kill him.

386
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,918
- You'll kill him.
- Filippo.

387
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,449
Yes, sir.

388
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:01,481
Take this gentleman to see
the dogs caught in the last two days.

389
00:52:02,257 --> 00:52:03,566
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

390
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:05,159
Well, what have you decided?

391
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:07,912
So you'll kill him?

392
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:09,837
We have to.
What else can we do with them?

393
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:17,254
- But 450 lire...
- Next.

394
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:22,624
We caught this one the day
before yesterday, that one yesterday.

395
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,642
That one the day before yesterday.

396
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,423
That one ten days ago.

397
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,230
This one yesterday.

398
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:38,719
And this one the day before.
Watch out for the cart.

399
00:54:13,555 --> 00:54:16,520
See, he's not dead!

400
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:19,145
Good evening, Mrs. Malantoni.
Good evening, sir.

401
00:54:20,144 --> 00:54:23,045
What do you want from me?

402
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:26,501
We'll be going to your funeral,
not the other way around!

403
00:54:26,572 --> 00:54:28,546
You think I owe you something?

404
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,048
What are you yelling about?

405
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:34,625
You wretch! Pay your debts.

406
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,000
My debts!

407
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,583
That's not the reason
you want to kick me out.

408
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:41,857
Tomorrow the doorman
will kick you out.

409
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:44,738
There are laws, you know.
I pay my debts.

410
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:49,274
I worked for the Ministry
of Public Works for 30 years!

411
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,424
I've always paid my debts.

412
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,202
Debts!

413
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:03,313
She doesn't even know
what a bill is.

414
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:40,676
I have seven people to support.
Spare some change, please.

415
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:44,672
I have seven dependents.
Spare some change.

416
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:47,264
Thank you.

417
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:21,068
Battistini.

418
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:25,232
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

419
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,892
So-so. How about you?

420
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,670
I can't complain.
How are things?

421
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:34,184
- You know. Getting by.
- Excuse me. I'm catching the bus.

422
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:40,009
I'll take the next one.

423
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,280
My dear Ferrari, how are you?

424
00:56:43,531 --> 00:56:48,002
I'm having a dispute with my landlady.

425
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:49,697
I'm sure I'm going to win.

426
00:56:50,728 --> 00:56:53,148
I'll get an injunction and stop her.

427
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:58,784
I'll pay 7,500 lire and I'll stop her.

428
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:01,436
All I need is half the money.

429
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:03,259
I have to find 2,000 lire.

430
00:57:06,976 --> 00:57:10,619
- You're still at the same address?
- Yes, I'm not moving from there.

431
00:57:11,326 --> 00:57:15,285
The landlady would like
to kick me out right now.

432
00:57:15,356 --> 00:57:18,867
You understand?
2,000 lire is all -

433
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:22,103
I'm sorry.
I don't want to miss my bus.

434
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:25,266
Good-bye, Ferrari.
So nice to see you again.

435
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,096
If you see Carloni,
give him my regards.

436
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:37,934
- He's dead.
- Dead?

437
00:57:41,744 --> 00:57:42,921
Thank you.

438
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:46,211
Ma'am, I have two children.

439
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:47,371
Thank you.

440
00:57:47,437 --> 00:57:48,898
I have seven dependents.

441
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:40,365
Be still.

442
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:04,490
- Flike, what are you doing there?
- Commendatore!

443
01:00:04,556 --> 01:00:06,824
How are you, Commendatore?

444
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,858
I was just wondering
what Flike was doing here.

445
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:14,685
He's playing.
He plays all day long.

446
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:17,504
He's so clever.
How adorable.

447
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:19,520
He's so cute.

448
01:00:19,588 --> 01:00:20,962
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

449
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:23,710
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
- I can't. My bus is leaving.

450
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:26,330
- Just a cup of coffee.
- No, thanks. The bus is leaving.

451
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:29,912
- A drink. Something.
- Really, I'd love to, but I can't.

452
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:34,040
- At least allow me to walk with you.
- Of course.

453
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,662
What are you doing these days?
- Nothing.

454
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:40,692
I'm a pensioner, so I'm just getting by.
I don't do anything.

455
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,671
Lucky you, with nothing to do.

456
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:50,322
You're late, sir.

457
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,192
Do you think
there's going to be a war?

458
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,379
Who knows?

459
01:01:25,253 --> 01:01:26,497
We're leaving.

460
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:28,605
Good-bye.

461
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,626
- Congratulations once again.
- Congratulations.

462
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:47,600
Thank you, dear.

463
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:56,054
- All the best, dear.
- You promised to come visit us.

464
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:58,932
- I promise.
- Come see how the baby has grown.

465
01:01:58,997 --> 01:02:01,069
All right.
Give the baby a kiss for me.

466
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:16,519
- All the best.
- Thank you.

467
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:21,216
- All the best.
- Thank you. Good-bye.

468
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:34,020
Don't forget tomorrow,
and don't be late.

469
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,278
We can't be late.

470
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:40,344
Good-bye, dear.

471
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,199
Good-bye.

472
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:48,311
- Paolo.
- What is it?

473
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:54,453
What is it, Olga?

474
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:03,885
My dear.

475
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,605
Careful.

476
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:35,010
Flike, you naughty boy.

477
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:37,347
You had us all so worried.

478
01:04:37,418 --> 01:04:39,621
You ran away, didn't you?

479
01:04:42,184 --> 01:04:44,005
Have a piece of cake.

480
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:54,048
She wants to make
one big formal living room.

481
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:02,939
Mr. Umberto, eat the cake.

482
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,841
What's the matter, Mr. Umberto?

483
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,046
I'm tired.

484
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:16,973
Of her?

485
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:21,202
It's a little of everything.

486
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:29,997
Wherever you go,
you'll be happier than you are here.

487
01:05:53,093 --> 01:05:54,653
That's the way it goes.

488
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,786
Go on, eat.

489
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:40,337
Where's he going?

490
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:45,229
Leaving already, Mr. Umberto?

491
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,017
Yes.

492
01:09:48,694 --> 01:09:50,122
Where are you going?

493
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:51,956
I found a place.

494
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,067
Nearby?

495
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:55,758
Yes.

496
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:58,599
Then we'll see each other
from time to time.

497
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:04,229
Listen, you need to leave as well.

498
01:10:04,302 --> 01:10:06,243
There are lots of jobs in Rome.

499
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:08,037
Don't stay here.

500
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:12,580
She'll kick me out the minute
she finds out I'm pregnant.

501
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,078
Can't you go back to your hometown?

502
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,497
My father would beat me.

503
01:10:22,373 --> 01:10:25,122
Will we meet again, Mr. Umberto?

504
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:31,870
I left a few things in the dresser.
You take them.

505
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:35,419
Good-bye.

506
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,492
Good-bye.

507
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:59,849
Get rid of the one from Florence.

508
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:02,383
Yes, Mr. Umberto.

509
01:11:50,492 --> 01:11:53,306
I'm sorry, but you can't
bring the dog on.

510
01:11:56,506 --> 01:11:59,057
- Before 8:00 you can.
- You telling me the rules?

511
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:01,844
If it's a hunting dog, you can.
Otherwise, you can't.

512
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:04,298
I could say I'm going hunting.

513
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:05,516
For what?

514
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:08,360
Couldn't I have a gun in my suitcase?

515
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:11,537
All right.
Where are you getting off?

516
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:13,292
Via Leccosa.

517
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:18,884
Go.

518
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:53,396
- That whistle just keeps blowing.
- I'm so sleepy in the morning.

519
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:57,208
He's little, but he's mischievous.

520
01:13:58,815 --> 01:14:02,327
- No, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
- If you say so.

521
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,211
- How many dogs do you have?
- About 20. Why?

522
01:14:05,276 --> 01:14:06,966
Do you keep them here all day long?

523
01:14:08,762 --> 01:14:10,649
We have fresh air and space.

524
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:14,901
I'd like to board my dog here.
Can I see where they sleep?

525
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:18,577
- They sleep in the house with us.
- Three of them sleep with me.

526
01:14:18,646 --> 01:14:21,328
A blind one, plus two others.

527
01:14:21,397 --> 01:14:24,429
They snuggle up against me all night.

528
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:31,045
I'm going on a trip.
I'd like to leave him here.

529
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,297
For how long?

530
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:35,586
A while.

531
01:14:35,661 --> 01:14:38,343
Board is 100 lire a day.

532
01:14:38,412 --> 01:14:40,299
Bread is expensive.

533
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:41,311
Right?

534
01:14:41,387 --> 01:14:43,012
There are other expenses:

535
01:14:43,082 --> 01:14:47,586
tripe, pasta, tomato sauce,
because we cook for them.

536
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:50,273
And besides the food,

537
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:52,643
there's the bleach
and everything else.

538
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:56,863
Tripe is expensive,
and so is bleach and sawdust.

539
01:14:56,931 --> 01:14:59,069
And we have to eat, too.

540
01:15:02,304 --> 01:15:04,158
I'd like to leave you 5,000 lire.

541
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:16,185
Actually, almost 6,000.

542
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:23,343
Plus this suitcase full of stuff.

543
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,413
When are you coming back?

544
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:42,725
I don't know. We'll see.

545
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:45,257
See all this nice stuff?

546
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:58,238
You know, some people leave
their dogs here and never come back.

547
01:15:58,311 --> 01:15:59,554
What do you do then?

548
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:01,148
I run them off.
What do you expect?

549
01:16:01,221 --> 01:16:03,195
Do you ever walk them?

550
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,113
There's a boy willing to do it,
but he wants to be paid.

551
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,805
We keep them here.

552
01:16:07,873 --> 01:16:10,523
We train them,
and they get used to it.

553
01:16:11,936 --> 01:16:13,942
No, they don't get used to it.

554
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,521
No. I'm not leaving him here.

555
01:16:29,143 --> 01:16:30,158
Good-bye.

556
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:32,815
More money and less talk.

557
01:16:32,886 --> 01:16:34,990
You wasted my time.

558
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,238
Daniela!

559
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:05,730
Mommy!

560
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:07,875
Hi, honey.

561
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:14,522
Good boy.

562
01:18:28,799 --> 01:18:31,481
- Hello, Daniela.
- Hello.

563
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:37,520
Daniela, do you really love Flike?

564
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:38,642
Really and truly?

565
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:41,236
Yes.

566
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:44,685
Then you can have him.

567
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:50,253
Yes. And you can have
the leash, too.

568
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:54,606
- Miss, this dog is mine.
- What do you mean, yours?

569
01:18:54,674 --> 01:18:56,234
Yes, it's mine.

570
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:03,942
I'd be very happy
if the little girl would take him.

571
01:19:04,013 --> 01:19:06,500
Who will clean up after him?
Dogs are dirty.

572
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:08,776
Guess who'll end up
with the dirty work?

573
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,047
- I'll clean up after him.
- Oh, sure.

574
01:19:11,115 --> 01:19:15,237
No, her mother doesn't want a dog.
Come on. Let's go.

575
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:17,670
He's never any trouble.

576
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:20,098
He's as obedient as a child.

577
01:19:21,285 --> 01:19:23,586
You'll see. She'll be happy.
- Sure, it's a bargain.

578
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:28,888
But I'm giving him to her for nothing.
A dog like him, for nothing.

579
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:30,935
Right. And that's why
you're getting rid of him.

580
01:19:31,009 --> 01:19:33,691
Come on. Let's go, Daniela.

581
01:19:33,759 --> 01:19:37,173
Walk, you spoiled little brat.
Come on.

582
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:40,151
Daniela, let's go.

583
01:22:52,737 --> 01:22:54,329
Flike, come here.

584
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:02,778
Flike, come here.

585
01:23:54,819 --> 01:23:56,793
Flike, look at the pinecone.

586
01:23:57,219 --> 01:23:59,290
Come on. Here, boy.

587
01:24:00,512 --> 01:24:05,463
Come on. Stand up.

588
01:24:14,106 --> 01:24:15,349
Come on.

589
01:24:15,513 --> 01:24:17,171
Come on. Run.

590
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:22,896
Here it is.

591
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:26,260
Come on, Flike. Up!

592
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:31,629
Good boy, Flike.

593
01:24:35,632 --> 01:24:38,086
Run, Flike. Run!

594
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,176
THE END
