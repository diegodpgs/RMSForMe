This film is dedicated to
the Memory of Andre Bazin

21
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:21,307
Doinel! Bring me that

22
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,826
Nice! Get in the corner

23
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,063
Just one minute left.
Silence

24
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,239
30 seconds left.
Silence, please

25
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,318
Be ready to pick up the papers

26
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,984
I'll count to three

27
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,986
One, two

28
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,325
three. Collect the papers

29
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,271
Get his, first

30
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,406
Give it to me. Wait a minute.
-What's going on?

31
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,311
He won't give me his paper.
-No exception

32
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,147
Asshole

33
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:36,982
Do I have everybody's paper?
Class dismissed

34
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,057
Not you

35
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,165
Recess isn't mandatory.
It's a reward

36
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:26,999
Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unjustifiably punished by Sourpuss

37
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:31,237
for a pinup fallen from the sky
It will be an eye for an eye

38
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,082
You need a referee maybe

39
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,981
No recess for three days

40
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:39,917
That will teach you

41
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,327
Hey guys, look at this

42
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,895
What's so interesting over there?

43
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,017
We have a new poet in our class

44
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,750
Only he can't tell an Alexandrine
from a decasyllabic verse

45
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,326
Doinel, you'll conjugate
for tomorrow

46
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,985
go to your seat

47
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,631
in indicative, conditional and
subjunctive tenses the sentence

48
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,394
everyone else recitation books out

49
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,766
I deface the classroom walls

50
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:41,048
and abuse French verse

51
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,253
The Hare

52
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,263
Now, Doinel, go get some water

53
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,732
and erase those insanities, or I'll
make you lick the wall, my friend

54
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,699
who gave you permission
to change seats, Richer?

55
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,482
In the season when the thickets

56
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:31,088
Glow with flowers

57
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,562
When the black tip

58
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:51,014
Of my long ears

59
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,156
Could be seen

60
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,091
Above

61
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,395
The still green rye

62
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,574
From which I nibbled

63
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,614
The tender stems

64
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,420
As I played around

65
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:36,854
One day that

66
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,767
Unaware

67
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,635
I was there

68
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:57,776
Fast asleep in my hutch.
Little Margot surprised me

69
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,426
I saw you, Simonet!
-I didn't do anything, Sir

70
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:11,226
Naturally.
She loved me so

71
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,265
My beautiful mistress

72
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,010
She was tender

73
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,377
And sweet

74
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,821
How she hugged me on her lap

75
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,286
And kissed me

76
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,355
What idiot whistled?
I'm warning you

77
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,295
If no one confesses, you'll
all be sorry. Right, Simonet?

78
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,460
I didn't do it, Sir.
It wasn't me, Sir

79
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:52,596
Cowards, too! What a class this year

80
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,801
I've known idiots, but at least
they were discreet

81
00:09:55,978 --> 00:10:00,278
and didn't get caught. And you

82
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,783
you call this clean? You made that
wall dirtier! Go back to your seat

83
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,685
Your parents will hear from me!
Poor France! What a future

84
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,932
Everybody steals money from their
parents! -Maybe but it isn't easy

85
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:25,472
I bet even Mauricet does it. -Come
here. We want to ask you something

86
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,337
Where'd you get these expensive
glasses? -I bought them

87
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,945
Did you steal the money
from your dad or your mom?

88
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:35,414
Don't pretend you've never
gone through their pockets

89
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:39,020
You're the louse
who got me in trouble

90
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,249
You're a louse, Mauricet!
Your days are numbered

91
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,120
You better watch it

92
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,855
I'll never finish tonight

93
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:03,102
Sourpuss is an asshole.
-It's his job

94
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,507
Before the Army gets me

95
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,047
I'll break his face

96
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,551
Bye.
-Bye

97
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,608
I deface the classroom walls

98
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,224
Hi, Mom.
-Hello

99
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,136
Where's the flour?
-The flour?

100
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,773
What's this? You didn't buy
what I told you to

101
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,702
Where's the list I left you?

102
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,808
I lost it. -No wonder you
get such bad grades

103
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,348
Get me my slippers

104
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,918
In the bedroom.
Under the bed

105
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:11,389
And go get that flour.
I need it right away

106
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:35,217
A difficult delivery. They used
forceps. It runs in the family

107
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:38,087
The same thing happened to her
mother. -It doesn't mean anything

108
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,526
For Fanny, it was over in ten
minutes. But with my last one

109
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:46,657
if I hadn't had a C-section,
I wouldn't be here, talking to you

110
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,963
And my sister, one every year.
Can you imagine?

111
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:58,069
The doctor warned her. She had to
have surgery. There was blood over

112
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:04,617
Always running, son?
-I got in trouble with Mom

113
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:08,917
You know you shouldn't
get your mother angry

114
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,719
What's that? -A fog-light. I'll
try it on Sunday at the race

115
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:30,238
Look at your son. All floured up!
-I'm not in the mood

116
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,277
Too bad. I am

117
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,075
What about my change?
-I need it for lunch at school

118
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,617
Ask your father

119
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,696
Nothing quiet on the home front.
-I need some money for lunch, Dad

120
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:53,426
Only 1.000 francs.
-Therefore you hope for 500

121
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,230
therefore you need 300.
Here's 100

122
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,373
Here's 500 more.
Next time ask your mother

123
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:05,570
Where are the scissors?
-Where are the scissors?

124
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:09,911
That's not funny.
Put that homework away

125
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:14,021
it's time to eat.
-Your mother's right. There's a time

126
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,884
and place for everything

127
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,522
Where did you get this pen?
-I traded it

128
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,364
You do a lot of trading lately

129
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,672
Do you smell something?

130
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,303
It's the fish.
-It's promising

131
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,783
I can't wait. Go ask your mom
if the dishtoweI is burning. -Why?

132
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:45,414
That's a joke

133
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,104
You can cIear the tabIe now

134
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,506
I got a call from your cousin.
His wife is pregnant again

135
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,614
Four times in 3 years! Worse
than rabbits! That's disgusting

136
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,876
By the way, what should
we do with the kid next summer?

137
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,421
There's always camp.
-You're right and it's fun

138
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,820
We don't have to decide yet.
-The sooner the better

139
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,823
Hey, be careful

140
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,826
Isn't it a beauty?
-Lions Racing Club

141
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,137
What's going on here?
-Slowly

142
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:41,138
Where would you prefer
to race, next Sunday?

143
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,801
It's my pick this time.
-I want to rest on Sunday

144
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,645
I'II go over to Huguette's.
-What wiII the feIIows think?

145
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,309
Listen, I need a rest.
Between the cleaning

146
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,014
in the morning.
-And in the afternoon

147
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,354
Your typing in the afternoon. You
definitely got the touch! -Go to bed

148
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,988
'Night Dad, 'night Mom

149
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,858
You are so stupid

150
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:12,598
Can't you take a joke? -You're
wasting your time with this crap

151
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:15,709
Antoine, don't forget the garbage
and turn your light off

152
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:19,904
I'm making contacts. It could
help me get a promotion

153
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,578
You? You'll never be
VP of anything

154
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,626
Get up, get up,
we didn't hear the alarm

155
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:32,549
I deface the classroom walls

156
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,087
I have no socks left around these
holes! -Those are gone

157
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,628
Buy yourself some new ones.
The others are dirty

158
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:47,761
I gave you money for the kid's
new sheets, remember?

159
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,133
He prefers his sleeping bag

160
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:55,436
Don't you, sweetheart?
-At least, it keeps me warm

161
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,077
You're still here?

162
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:08,186
Why are you running?
-We're going to be late

163
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:12,122
We'll have to sneak in again and
we'll get in trouble. -Don't rush

164
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,786
Why?
-Sourpuss won't let you in

165
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,162
You think he'll do it? -Yes.
He can't stand you. You got money?

166
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:23,566
Sure. Lunch money.
-In that case, let's go

167
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,364
What's the plan?

168
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:52,033
Follow me. Put your bag
next to mine behind the door.

169
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,634
Will they be safe?
-I always leave mine here

170
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:44,393
Oh, my God. It's Antoine. I'm sure
he saw me. -Which one is your son?

171
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,694
The brown one.
He's supposed to be in school

172
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,838
You're going to get it tonight!
-Kidding? She won't tell my father

173
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:53,167
That wasn't him?
-Never saw him before

174
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:54,933
You're safe, then

175
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,929
I'll go back to school tomorrow

176
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,598
But I'II need an excuse note.
What about you?

177
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,870
I have an old letter from my folks
I never used

178
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:35,441
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight

179
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,018
But the handwriting?
-Imitate your mother's

180
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:42,179
It'll be hard, she writes funny

181
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,554
Don't worry. It will work!
-I hope so

182
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,364
Dear Sir

183
00:25:54,402 --> 00:26:02,639
Will you excuse my son

184
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,643
Rene

185
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,246
who was sick

186
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,587
My son Rene

187
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,505
Something's burning again here?
-It comes from downstairs

188
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,139
Set the table for two only.
-Why? Has Mom left?

189
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:46,412
No, she called to say
she'd be home late

190
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,920
Her boss needs her for the inventory

191
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:54,393
So we'll cook ourselves and
have a real bachelor's dinner

192
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:58,823
She said there are eggs.
-I know where

193
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,898
How was school today?

194
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:11,309
What did you study?
-The Hare

195
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:16,007
Oh, yes. The Hare and The Tortoise.
-No, it's just The Hare

196
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,319
Did you do well?
-I wasn't asked anything

197
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:23,321
You must be aggressive
to go forward in life

198
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,187
or else you won't make it
to the finish line

199
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,329
You have to take initiatives

200
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,692
Have you thought about your mother's
birthday? It's on the 17th, you know

201
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,030
I hope you'll get her something

202
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,432
Antoine, are you listening?

203
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,737
Oh, I know what you're thinking

204
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,147
She's been tough on you lately

205
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:51,547
She's nervous.
You have to understand

206
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,650
She has lots to do between
being a housewife and her job

207
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:58,724
And this place is too small

208
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:02,625
We might be moving soon.
I'm working on it

209
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,560
And you see, at the office

210
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:12,706
they take advantage of women

211
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,336
But she loves you, you know.
She does. Oh, shit

212
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,552
Where did you put my Michelin guide?
-I didn't touch it

213
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,320
Antoine, you know,
I can't stand it when you lie

214
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,456
I'm sure.
-I'm sure I had it yesterday

215
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,200
I swear it's not me!
-It's incredible

216
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,099
how things always disappear
in this house

217
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,206
I didn't take it

218
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:52,879
All right, I'll ask your mother

219
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,079
Go to bed

220
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,279
Don't forget the garbage

221
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:00,745
My boss drove me home

222
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,114
I couldn't refuse

223
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:08,346
Are you getting paid overtime?
-Of course, at the end of the month

224
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,855
He should give you cash

225
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:15,052
Enough already! -No wonder
you'll need to rest on Sunday

226
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:19,325
Where's my Michelin's guide?
-How would I know? Ask Antoine

227
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,025
He said he didn't touch it.
-He's always lying

228
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:24,228
Like you. -You should show him
some manners

229
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:31,038
I gave him a name. I feed him.
-I'm sick of this

230
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:34,773
If you can't handle him, let's
send him away to boarding school

231
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,507
so I can have some
peace for a change

232
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,264
The best thing is to eat out
until the end of the month

233
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,930
For that, I need a clean shirt

234
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,737
You could at least wash the collar

235
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,880
If only you hadn't bought
that fog-light

236
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,447
I got it secondhand

237
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:19,584
Well? Open the door!
-What if it's the gas man?

238
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,592
They always send a notice first

239
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:30,833
Hi, Sir. I'm in Antoine's class.
I came to see if he is better

240
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,566
Better? Why?
-He wasn't at school yesterday

241
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,039
Did you hear that?

242
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,545
Thanks, kiddo.
-Bye, Sir

243
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,280
You don't seem surprised

244
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:54,491
Why should I be?
I expect anything from him

245
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,564
What excuse should I use?
-Something big

246
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,830
The bigger, the better. Last year,
when my mom broke her leg

247
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,702
I told them everything,
except that she was drunk

248
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,743
I didn't need a letter.
-I can't tell a thing like that

249
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:15,747
In any case, we can't show up
together. -Right. You go first

250
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,373
So, there you are

251
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:46,144
A little extra homework
and you get sick

252
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:50,717
And your parents fell for it. What
excuse do you have this time?

253
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,085
Let's see the letter

254
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:57,020
I don't have one. -And you think
you're going to get away with this?

255
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,590
It would be too easy, my friend

256
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:04,693
But Sir, it's my mother.
-What about your mother?

257
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,026
She's dead

258
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:11,135
I'm sorry, kid. I didn't know

259
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,898
Was she ill?
-Yes, Sir

260
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,304
You should have told me. You should
always confide in your teachers

261
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,681
Go join the others

262
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:36,623
What did you tell him?
-Leave me alone

263
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:51,578
Better thorns in the woods than...
-Up your

264
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:56,172
If you washed your ears, Duverger,
you would hear the whispering

265
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,081
Than up your ass! -He's not
whispering. He wants to confuse me

266
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,952
I'm all mixed up now, Sir

267
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,320
Than flowers in the cradle. -Flowers
in the cradle. Better to have freedom

268
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,135
And feel a threat...
-Than slavery

269
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,600
With an eternal April...
And you're eternally lazy

270
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,802
Sit down! F!
-I knew it at home

271
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,908
Doinel! Oh, sorry, my boy

272
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,414
Simonot

273
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:19,465
I suggest he gets
maximum punishment

274
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:23,365
He's beyond that.
He was out of line

275
00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:27,064
This is a matter for his parents.
-We'll settle this at home tonight

276
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:39,047
What're you gonna do?
-After that

277
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,088
I can't live with my parents
anymore. I have to go away

278
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:47,159
You're over reacting!
-Well

279
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,025
I've got to live my own life.
I'll write them a letter and explain

280
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:53,462
Right now?
-Yes, I better

281
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:57,365
Where will you sleep tonight?
-I don't know. I don't care

282
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:00,666
I might have an idea.
Meet me in an hour

283
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,934
in front of the fountain,
place Pigalle. -OK

284
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,464
It used to be my
uncle's printing factory

285
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,400
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in

286
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,096
Do you think it's dangerous?

287
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,906
No. It already hit the bottom!
At least you'll be warm here

288
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,996
Here's a mattress and a pillow

289
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,897
Wow, it's heavy

290
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,268
Don't come here until midnight

291
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,371
Keep my bag. You'll give it
back to me tomorrow

292
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,112
My dear Parents. I understand,
misspelled of course

293
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:21,686
the gravity of my lie.
-Listen to this

294
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:25,257
Why did he have me die and not you?
-He prefers me, obviously

295
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:27,894
But now, we can't
live together anymore

296
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:31,498
So I'm going to try to live
my own life here or elsewhere

297
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:34,657
When I'm a man, I'll return

298
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:39,238
and we'll talk about everything.
Goodbye. Love, Antoine

299
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,670
So, you think it's normal
that he hates me

300
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,039
You're too hard on him.
-He gets on my nerves

301
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,960
Can you help me catch him?

302
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:16,334
That's your sister? -I don't know
her. She asked me to chase her dog

303
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,637
Is it her dog?
-I don't know

304
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,046
May I help you?
-Sure. The more the better

305
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,983
What's his name?
-I don't know

306
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,122
Beat it, kid!
-But she asked me first

307
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:41,429
MERRY CHRISTMAS

308
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:44,845
Tell me, Doinel, I bet
you got it last night

309
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:46,816
Not at all, everything went fine

310
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,582
Parents are irresponsible

311
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,565
Last and simple question

312
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:16,778
No, the tip of the tongue
between the teeth

313
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,984
As if you had a lisp

314
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:25,485
But I can't, Sir. Not everybody
has a tongue like yours

315
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,286
Shut up

316
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:30,995
Go, sit...
Go sit down

317
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,165
You're insolent

318
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,339
Fronchot, you're in charge
until I come back

319
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,641
We don't know what
to do with him anymore

320
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:26,615
My dear Lady, you don't deserve this

321
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:30,780
My poor darling. Are you alright?

322
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,983
Where did you spend the night?
-In a printing factory

323
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:38,293
I don't care about his grades.
All I want is for him to behave

324
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:39,625
Alright then

325
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:44,426
Maybe it's genetic

326
00:44:00,702 --> 00:44:02,533
You mustn't catch cold

327
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:06,230
Now jump in bed

328
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,837
I'm not tired, Mom

329
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,336
No, no. You'll be more
comfortable in ours

330
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:27,761
You know, I was once
your age too

331
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,863
Children always forget that

332
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:32,431
I didn't want to confide
to my parents either

333
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,329
I kept a secret diary

334
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:38,865
One day, I'll show it to you

335
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:44,273
When I was your age
I ran away with a farm-boy

336
00:44:44,446 --> 00:44:46,914
It wasn't serious
but we were caught

337
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:49,515
My mother made me promise
never to see him again

338
00:44:49,684 --> 00:44:52,551
and she didn't tell my father.
So, I cried

339
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,451
but I obeyed, because
a mother always knows best

340
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:59,058
We, too, can have secrets, you know

341
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:03,129
What did you mean in your letter by

342
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:07,530
We'll talk about everything.
-I meant

343
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:11,365
my problems at school.
-So, tell me

344
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,063
I can't concentrate

345
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,443
I'd like to quit school
and start making a living

346
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:19,944
What are you saying?

347
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:22,981
I wish I'd studied longer

348
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,915
And if your father
had gone to college

349
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:28,112
he'd be much further in his career

350
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,383
I know you learn lots
of useless things at school

351
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,255
Algebra, science

352
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,193
Who needs it? But French, eh?

353
00:45:37,365 --> 00:45:40,266
We all need to write letters

354
00:45:41,436 --> 00:45:44,633
Let's share another secret, Ok?

355
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:51,104
If next time you have a test
you're among

356
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:55,043
the top five, I'll give
you 1.000 francs, Ok?

357
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:56,774
But you mustn't tell your father

358
00:47:33,982 --> 00:47:36,576
The dying man pulled himself up

359
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:40,346
And gave his children
a piercing look

360
00:47:40,521 --> 00:47:43,513
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

361
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:48,094
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

362
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:50,492
He raised his hand with anger

363
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:53,190
And shouted Archimedes'
famous last words

364
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:55,131
Eureka! I found it

365
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:13,751
Describe a serious event which you
witnessed and involved you personally

366
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:17,887
Eureka, I found it

367
00:48:21,896 --> 00:48:27,357
My grandfather's death

368
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:57,896
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary now

369
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,967
Well armed that girl

370
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:04,931
She used her weapons to be
promoted executive secretary

371
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,767
Of course, she's got what it takes

372
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:13,235
Now, we'll have to watch out for
her. You know, pillow talk

373
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:16,445
I used to tell

374
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:18,881
how to cheat on her travel expenses

375
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:20,953
but now I may regret it

376
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:26,388
By the way, I still haven't
found my Michelin guide

377
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:31,831
One of you must have it.
-Who cares?

378
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:33,489
Well, I don't Iike mysteries

379
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:38,228
You Ieft something on the stove
again. -No, I didn't

380
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,539
I can't believe this.
Stop screaming

381
00:49:45,246 --> 00:49:46,873
Go get some water instead of
screaming

382
00:49:50,718 --> 00:49:53,084
You idiot! I've had it with you

383
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:57,281
What possessed you,
to light a candle in there?

384
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:02,088
It was for Balzac, Daddy. -Balzac?
Are you pulling my leg?

385
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:05,460
It was for my writing class. -Leave
him alone. He promised me something

386
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:10,296
To collect our home insurance?
One candle won't do the job

387
00:50:10,471 --> 00:50:12,939
You want my lighter, perhaps.
-Don't be ridiculous

388
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:17,240
As long as we feed you,
you'll do as you're told

389
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:20,373
or else we'll send you
to the military Academy

390
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:25,384
You never heard of it. You'll learn
fast! They'll keep you in the line

391
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:29,080
Why don't we get out of here

392
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:32,385
and go to the movies together?
-Good

393
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,552
That's your way of
teaching him a lesson?

394
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,063
Did you write a good paper?
-I think so

395
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:46,764
Trust him, Julien.
You'll have a pleasant surprise

396
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:49,705
Sounds dangerous. -So, are you
taking us to the movies?

397
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:52,277
What's playing?
-Paris is Ours

398
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,472
Since you're both against me.
-You'd rather stay here?

399
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:04,024
I deserve to go out! But they don't
care much for arsonists at the theater

400
00:51:35,723 --> 00:51:42,720
She had one of those...
-That's all you noticed

401
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:51,728
I liked the movie.
-But it wasn't funny

402
00:51:51,906 --> 00:51:56,366
But it had some depth.
-Some what?

403
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:17,730
Gen. Daredevil and his Army

404
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,534
Look at your mother's legs.
Pretty, eh?

405
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:39,576
Home sweet home, smoky though.
-Don't forget the garbage, honey

406
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:44,216
I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it

407
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:38,168
Doinel, if your paper is first today
it's because I've decided to give

408
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:41,179
the results beginning with the worst

409
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:45,410
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend

410
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:50,353
To those less familiar with Balzac,
we have here A Sinister Affair

411
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:57,456
That Doinel chose to write about his
grandfather's death was his right

412
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:02,295
We know he doesn't hesitate to
sacrifice his relatives if necessary

413
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,268
It's not true, Sir. I didn't cheat!
-Judge for yourselves

414
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:12,177
The dying man pulled himself up, and
gave his children a piercing look

415
00:54:12,346 --> 00:54:15,975
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

416
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,142
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

417
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,154
He raised his hand with anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words

418
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:26,782
Eureka! I found it!
Well, I found it, too, Doinel

419
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:29,987
You're an abominable plagiarist!
-That's not true

420
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:32,098
Take your paper to
the principal, immediately

421
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:39,168
And tell him you're suspended from
class until the end of the semester

422
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:57,146
He didn't cheat, Sir. I sat next to
him. I would have noticed if he did

423
00:54:57,324 --> 00:55:00,225
You want to be suspended, too?
-I wouldn't mind

424
00:55:01,495 --> 00:55:04,487
Talking back? Get out

425
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:08,257
I don't mind being suspended but
I don't want to go out. -Get out

426
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:12,304
It's illegal! -I'll show
you who makes the law here

427
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,310
So, did you take him to the
principal? -No, he ran away

428
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:39,625
So I punched him
and I ran away

429
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,634
What happened? -He was furious. I'm
suspended from school until Christmas

430
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:53,110
Now I really can't go home

431
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,875
My father said he'd send me to the
Military Academy. -What's that?

432
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:59,952
Some kind of military school.
-You'll wear a nice uniform

433
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,682
and besides, there's a future in the
Army. -Thanks, but no, thanks

434
00:56:03,858 --> 00:56:08,295
If only it was the Navy!
I've never seen the sea

435
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:11,863
I've seen the Channel, the Atlantic,
the Mediterranean

436
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:16,264
but not the North Sea. Come on,
you can stay with me. We'll manage

437
00:56:43,497 --> 00:56:45,965
Holy cow, a horse

438
00:56:46,767 --> 00:56:48,462
It's my father's. It's a souvenir

439
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:52,630
It's big here

440
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:59,038
You can sleep on the couch. No one
will know. -What about your folks?

441
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:02,341
They're never here. My mother drinks
and my father is always at the track

442
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:03,915
You're free to come and go

443
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:08,584
First, we've got to find a way
to make some money

444
00:57:09,456 --> 00:57:13,187
Right, that's the first thing to do.
-That's the first thing to do

445
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,056
In the meantime, I'll take an
advance on my inheritance

446
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:36,764
Hi, Lady!
-Little wretch

447
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:07,930
Have you seen your mother lately?
-Today when I came home from school

448
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:13,469
She makes sure she's out
when I'm here

449
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,301
She must be up to something

450
01:00:17,745 --> 01:00:18,973
Where's the fruit?

451
01:00:42,503 --> 01:00:43,902
This is for you

452
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:11,128
Oh, 9:30. I'll be late for the club

453
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:31,776
Hurry up! We'll miss the newsreel

454
01:02:21,568 --> 01:02:23,058
Boy, I'm thirsty

455
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:30,708
It's already empty, asshole.
-Your turn. Hurry up

456
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:46,025
Eh, that's the old man!
-Help me with the blanket

457
01:02:59,306 --> 01:03:02,207
That's fine.
What's all this smoke?

458
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,606
Where do you think you are?

459
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:07,679
Alright, retain the cost of
3 cigars on your pocket-money

460
01:03:07,848 --> 01:03:10,817
What's this?
My horse is not a coat rack

461
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:16,984
It's worth a lot of money!
It's a work of art

462
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:19,922
I'll never get rid of it,
unless I have to

463
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:24,894
Turn your light off,
and go to bed now

464
01:03:34,808 --> 01:03:36,036
Eh, not bad

465
01:03:45,752 --> 01:03:49,347
Give me your Michelin guide.
-We could sell the horse

466
01:03:49,523 --> 01:03:52,151
No. My dad would kill me

467
01:03:52,326 --> 01:03:55,124
Coward! With the money
we'd live by the sea

468
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:58,025
have boats. We'd be on our own

469
01:04:56,423 --> 01:04:59,415
Make up your mind. -I'm sure we
could get one from my father's office

470
01:04:59,593 --> 01:05:03,154
Let's get it, then. -But we couldn't
sell it. They're all numbered

471
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,596
We'll pawn it.
My mother pawns everything

472
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,440
How much?
-10 percent

473
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,880
and 1000 francs in advance. -No,
when you get back with the money

474
01:08:48,054 --> 01:08:50,045
I see you don't trust me

475
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:28,352
We want it back.
-Where do you think you're going?

476
01:09:28,528 --> 01:09:29,620
I thought you were gone

477
01:09:31,064 --> 01:09:34,397
It didn't work. They want to see a
a receipt. -Give it back to us then

478
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:37,263
Fine, but I want
500 francs for my trouble

479
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:40,167
We don't have any money.
-Well

480
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,140
then 300. -We're broke.
Give us back our typewriter

481
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:47,803
Then I'll keep the typewriter
as a down payment

482
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:50,280
No way! It's ours!
-Listen

483
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,283
Give it back or I'll break
your face. -Hands off

484
01:09:53,453 --> 01:09:56,616
It's no more yours than mine,
alright? There comes a cop

485
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:58,155
Let's ask him

486
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:02,723
O.K. Keep the damned thing

487
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:10,661
I'm sick of carrying it!
-It's your turn

488
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:14,034
My father will guess I took it.
-It was your idea

489
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:17,370
It was yours, asshole.
-I don't care. I'll leave it here

490
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:22,311
Are you nuts?
-Alright, I'll take it back then

491
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:25,417
but I'm going to wear a hat

492
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:26,882
so the concierge won't recognize me

493
01:10:28,688 --> 01:10:32,886
Please, bring it back for me.
-Oh, no! It wasn't my idea

494
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:36,756
OK. But you're an asshole.
Hold it, while I put on the hat

495
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,329
You'll wait for me outside

496
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:18,134
You're Mr. Doinel's son!
Put that down

497
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:21,034
Your father's not going to like this

498
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:25,541
This time, I'll show them
I'm doing my job

499
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:28,772
Don't try to escape.
I'm warning you

500
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:31,746
I've dealt with punks like you before

501
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:37,520
Mr. Doinel? Sorry to bother you

502
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,784
but you better come over

503
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:46,357
Let's say it's a surprise.
But not a pleasant one

504
01:11:49,836 --> 01:11:51,326
Keep that hat on

505
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,838
I'm not taking you to
a party, this time

506
01:12:00,013 --> 01:12:03,312
Happy days are over for you. Your
mother and I will have some peace

507
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:06,179
Take a good look at your pal

508
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,117
because you won't be
seeing him for a while

509
01:12:24,904 --> 01:12:28,772
Maybe this will do it.
This can't go on anymore

510
01:12:28,942 --> 01:12:31,410
If I'd done this when I was your age,
my father would have killed me

511
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,180
Can we see the Chief?

512
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:45,847
We've tried everything. Kindness,
persuasion, punishment

513
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:49,984
But we never hit him.
-Sometimes, the old methods

514
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:53,189
Of course, but we're not like that

515
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:57,027
He had a lot of freedom.
-Too much, perhaps

516
01:12:57,203 --> 01:13:01,902
Not too much. You see, both my wife
and I work, and you know how it is

517
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:03,770
I'm a father, too

518
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:07,340
I must admit it's not always easy

519
01:13:07,514 --> 01:13:09,948
If only we could talk with him

520
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:12,710
But he doesn't even listen

521
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:17,414
You think he's listening now? Look
how I found him with the typewriter

522
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,683
God only knows what goes on
in that head

523
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:24,487
Take down his statement

524
01:13:25,798 --> 01:13:27,425
Vagrancy and theft

525
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:38,605
So, what's your decision?
-In any case

526
01:13:38,778 --> 01:13:41,713
if I take him home,
he'll run away again

527
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:45,408
I don't know. Maybe you
could send him some place

528
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:50,181
to the countryside, where they'd
make him work. He won't study anymore

529
01:13:50,356 --> 01:13:54,884
We could put him in a house of
correction. They're well organized

530
01:13:55,061 --> 01:13:58,360
He'd learn a craft.
-That sounds fine

531
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:00,658
If there's room for him, of course

532
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:05,662
But you'll have to fill out an
application for the transfer of your

533
01:14:06,606 --> 01:14:09,302
parental rights to the Department
for the Juvenile Delinquents

534
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:13,573
He'll appear in the Juvenile Court
tomorrow morning

535
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:16,977
You or your wife must be present

536
01:14:18,985 --> 01:14:20,577
No one saw you enter the building?

537
01:14:22,522 --> 01:14:28,017
I hereby declare having broken
into the building and stole

538
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:38,293
a typewriter

539
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:43,338
Sign here

540
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:47,169
He's all yours

541
01:15:02,762 --> 01:15:04,320
Take care of him.
I'm going home

542
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:43,499
What did you do?
-I ran away from home

543
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:46,437
And you?

544
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,098
Oh, I

545
01:16:31,884 --> 01:16:33,283
Here come the girls

546
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:42,493
I saw a police station
in a movie. It was cleaner

547
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:47,223
I once saw a dirtier one.
-And I, more cheerful one

548
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:34,344
The limo has arrived, folks

549
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:54,025
Put on your jacket

550
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:54,914
Tie, belt, shoe lace.
Empty your pockets

551
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:24,608
Sign here

552
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:11,749
Maybe we could take him back

553
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,647
but he'd have to change drastically

554
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,311
If only you could scare him,
Your Honor

555
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:20,721
That's not my role.
-But we can't control him

556
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:24,294
Or perhaps you're not
doing it the right way

557
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:29,059
Tell me, is it true that he sometimes
spends his weekends home alone?

558
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:34,263
My husband has a racing club.
It's possible we left him home alone

559
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,036
but he hates sports. He spends
hours at the movies, ruining his eyes

560
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:42,940
What does your husband have to say?
It's his son after all

561
01:23:44,884 --> 01:23:49,753
He's not. He married me when my child
was still a baby. -That's quite noble

562
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:54,359
I shouldn't have told you.
-On the contrary

563
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:57,189
I think we should place your child

564
01:23:57,363 --> 01:24:02,164
under observation in a special home.
-Could it be by the sea, Your Honor?

565
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:04,268
We're not sending him
to Summer camp

566
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:07,900
But I'll do my best depending
on what's available

567
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:12,008
He'll stay there for 2 or 3 months
while I study his case

568
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:13,668
Then, we'll take a decision

569
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,676
Believe me, this change
will benefit him

570
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,477
Goodbye, Your Honor.
-Goodbye

571
01:24:24,156 --> 01:24:27,717
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

572
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:06,190
How did you end up here?
-And you?

573
01:25:06,365 --> 01:25:09,493
I made the wrong turn.
-I stole a typewriter

574
01:25:09,668 --> 01:25:12,228
A typewriter? That's dumb!
No wonder you got caught

575
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:15,965
They're numbered

576
01:25:16,141 --> 01:25:19,076
You see that big guy?

577
01:25:19,245 --> 01:25:20,542
He stole car tires

578
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:24,239
Each time I cried

579
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:27,283
my father would imitate
me on his fiddle

580
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:30,388
just to drive me nuts.
One day, I got fed up

581
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:33,116
and I knocked him out

582
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:35,920
Good for you. If I'd been you,
I would have killed him

583
01:25:39,732 --> 01:25:43,896
Who's that? They caught him.
He escaped a week ago

584
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:49,772
You know, you can escape
but you can't get caught

585
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:02,011
What are you doing here?
Line up! Quick

586
01:27:05,617 --> 01:27:06,948
Show me the bread

587
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:11,784
You couldn't wait, eh?

588
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:14,283
Bring your plate and bread here

589
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:29,468
Right or left?
-Left, Sir

590
01:27:37,616 --> 01:27:39,015
And no talking

591
01:27:47,426 --> 01:27:52,523
-I brought you that.
I bet they'd catch you and I won

592
01:27:58,003 --> 01:28:00,972
So what? I had five days of fun

593
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,576
I'll do it again.
-What are you doing here?

594
01:28:08,447 --> 01:28:10,347
Kanayan, to the psychologist

595
01:28:12,117 --> 01:28:15,382
If she drops her pen, pick it up
but don't look at her legs

596
01:28:15,554 --> 01:28:18,216
Or else, it will be on your record.
-My record?

597
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:21,791
They keep a file on what everybody
thinks of you. The doctor, the judge

598
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,155
even your parent's neighbors

599
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:26,126
I know mine by heart

600
01:28:26,832 --> 01:28:30,962
I'm an unstable psychotic
individual with perverted tendencies

601
01:28:31,136 --> 01:28:34,503
What if I play dumb?
-Then, it's the funny farm

602
01:28:34,673 --> 01:28:37,141
or boot camp

603
01:28:43,782 --> 01:28:47,309
Why did you return the typewriter?
-Well

604
01:28:47,486 --> 01:28:49,818
since I couldn't sell it or anything

605
01:28:49,988 --> 01:28:54,948
I got scared. I don't know
why I returned it. Just like that

606
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:58,722
I hear you stole 10.000 francs
from your grandmother

607
01:28:58,897 --> 01:29:02,060
She had invited me for her birthday

608
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:05,328
I thought she is old, and doesn't
eat much. She doesn't need the money

609
01:29:05,504 --> 01:29:07,563
She was going to die soon

610
01:29:08,373 --> 01:29:12,036
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I took some

611
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:17,043
I knew she wouldn't notice.
And she didn't

612
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:20,151
She gave me a nice book that day

613
01:29:21,353 --> 01:29:25,722
But my mother, she used
to go through my pockets

614
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:29,793
That night, while I was asleep

615
01:29:29,962 --> 01:29:32,954
she must have found the money in
my pocket cause next day it was gone

616
01:29:33,866 --> 01:29:38,326
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it

617
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:41,701
And then she took the nice book away

618
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:44,537
One day I asked for it back

619
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:47,668
and I found out she'd sold it

620
01:29:49,715 --> 01:29:51,683
Your parents say you're always lying

621
01:29:52,918 --> 01:29:56,376
Oh, I lie, now and then, I suppose

622
01:29:56,555 --> 01:29:59,422
Sometimes, if I told them the truth

623
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:01,422
they wouldn't believe me,
anyway. So I prefer to lie

624
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:03,856
Why don't you like your mother?

625
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:08,663
Well, she put me in a foster home
and then, when they had no more money

626
01:30:08,834 --> 01:30:10,096
I lived with my grandmother

627
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:14,464
But then she got old and
she couldn't take care of me anymore

628
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:18,900
So, when I was 8,
I went to live with my parents

629
01:30:19,077 --> 01:30:22,376
I could tell Mom didn't like me.
She was always

630
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:24,982
yelling at me for no reason

631
01:30:26,151 --> 01:30:30,986
There were fights at home

632
01:30:32,157 --> 01:30:34,318
and I, I overheard

633
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:42,130
that my mother had me
before she was married

634
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:46,533
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once

635
01:30:46,705 --> 01:30:50,004
that's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion

636
01:30:50,175 --> 01:30:52,006
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born

637
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:54,273
Have you ever slept with a girl?

638
01:30:58,016 --> 01:31:02,112
No. But some friends of mine have

639
01:31:02,287 --> 01:31:05,745
They told me where
the hookers hang out

640
01:31:06,858 --> 01:31:10,794
And so I went, and I tried
to pick up some girls

641
01:31:10,963 --> 01:31:14,330
but they yelled at me.
So, I got scared and I left

642
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:17,957
I went back several times

643
01:31:18,136 --> 01:31:20,502
Once a man asked me
what I was doing there

644
01:31:20,672 --> 01:31:23,607
He was North African. So I told him

645
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:26,573
I guess he knew a lot of women.
He said he knew one

646
01:31:26,745 --> 01:31:32,775
a young one, who liked guys my age

647
01:31:33,919 --> 01:31:37,480
So he took me to
the hotel where she was

648
01:31:37,656 --> 01:31:40,284
only she wasn't there that day

649
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:44,293
We waited an hour or two.
She didn't show up. So I left

650
01:32:42,788 --> 01:32:45,313
Don't look for your father,
I came alone. Over there?

651
01:33:10,349 --> 01:33:14,251
Your personal letter hurt
your father deeply

652
01:33:14,419 --> 01:33:17,047
and of course he showed it to me.
Whatever you may think

653
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:19,884
we get along well

654
01:33:20,025 --> 01:33:23,358
I went through a difficult time, but
you didn't need to remind him of it

655
01:33:23,528 --> 01:33:25,792
He gave you his name, after all

656
01:33:28,133 --> 01:33:32,433
We were willing to try again
and take you back

657
01:33:32,604 --> 01:33:34,834
but the neighbors would talk.
You probably complained

658
01:33:35,006 --> 01:33:38,669
to the entire neighborhood.
-I didn't say anything, Mom

659
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:42,644
I'm used to this anyway. I have
been criticized my entire life

660
01:33:42,814 --> 01:33:48,013
That's all I wanted to tell you.
And don't go crying to your father

661
01:33:48,186 --> 01:33:51,849
He told me to tell you
he doesn't care about you anymore

662
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:55,120
So you will be sent to a Labor Center

663
01:33:56,161 --> 01:34:00,359
You wanted to work.
Well, now you'll see if you like it
