1
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:06,423
<i>I don't have time.</i>

2
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,398
<i>I don't have time
to worry about how it happened.</i>

3
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>It is what it is.</i>

4
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:17,405
<i>We're genetically engineered
to stop aging at 25.</i>

5
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,473
<i>The trouble is,
we live only one more year</i>

6
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:24,407
<i>unless we can get more time.</i>

7
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:30,243
<i>Time is now the currency.</i>

8
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:33,916
<i>We earn it and spend it.</i>

9
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:37,258
<i>The rich can live forever.</i>

10
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,495
<i>And the rest of us?</i>

11
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,228
<i>I just want to wake up
with more time on my hand</i>

12
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,996
<i>than hours in the day.</i>

13
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:17,592
Hey, Mom.

14
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,562
You got in late last night.

15
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,229
I put in some overtime.

16
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,531
Where'd it go?

17
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:24,063
On you.

18
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:27,104
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 50th!

19
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,268
Fifty?

20
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,078
That's right.

21
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,977
Twenty-five for the 25th time.

22
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:36,982
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

23
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,244
Here we go.

24
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:40,017
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

25
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:43,754
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

26
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:45,659
What do you got?

27
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,323
Three days. Not even.

28
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,997
We owe half that in rent.

29
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,161
Eight for the electric
and we're still late on that loan.

30
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,001
I can make extra on the side, you know.

31
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,102
- I could--
- What, start fighting?

32
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:01,767
Nobody wins.

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,469
Yeah.

34
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:05,977
Remember, I'm not here tonight.

35
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,540
I got two days' work
in the garment district.

36
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,184
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

37
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,346
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long.
- I'll be there.

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,952
Will...

39
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,684
I just wouldn't know what to do
if I lost you.

40
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:18,955
I'm late.

41
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,791
Let me give you 30 minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

42
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:37,806
I love you.

43
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,809
Happy birthday, Mom.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,948
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

45
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,492
Will!

46
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,822
Will!

47
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:58,824
You got a minute?

48
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,868
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

49
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,071
Not a year I can use yet.

50
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,904
Come on, Will.
I've got bills to pay.

51
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,208
Here, take five minutes.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
Get out of here.

53
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,928
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?

54
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,438
Yesterday, it was three.

55
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,439
You want coffee
or you want to reminisce?

56
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,039
Two coffees.

57
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,104
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

58
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,880
Really excited about it.

59
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:52,117
If you had any of your father in you,
we could make a fortune.

60
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,223
I don't fight.

61
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:01,296
There's another one.
Broad daylight.

62
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,226
Whoa, what is this?
Where's the rest?

63
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,459
Never met the quota.

64
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,003
My units are up from last week.

65
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,934
So's the quota. Next.

66
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,132
That's a joke, right?

67
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,634
- Next.
- Move it. You're taking forever.

68
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:05,290
You in, Will?

69
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:07,126
I don't have time to gamble anymore.

70
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:08,855
Oh, thank God.

71
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,958
Because ever since you stopped playing,
I started winning.

72
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,196
You still owe me an hour.

73
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:17,304
You seen Borel?

74
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,980
- Will!
- Hey, man.

75
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:28,707
Your wife's looking for you.

76
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:29,810
You're not gonna believe it.

77
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,687
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!

78
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,054
Come on, let me get you home.

79
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,329
Soon as I finish this drink.

80
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,658
Hey! You!

81
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,122
You!

82
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,566
More everything!

83
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,565
Do you want to come home with me?

84
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:53,006
You can take us both home.

85
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,747
Excuse me.

86
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,517
You need to get out of here.

87
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,346
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.

88
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:08,583
Yes!

89
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:14,331
I mean, they aren't going to rob you.
They are going to kill you.

90
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,255
They can't take that much time

91
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,766
and let you live to tell about it.

92
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:18,857
Yes.

93
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:22,266
I don't think you understand.
You should not be here!

94
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,105
Will. Will!

95
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,881
Minutemen!

96
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,676
Minutemen!
Walk away, Will.

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,418
Those gangsters aren't playing around.

98
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,756
Wait, wait.

99
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:46,560
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.

100
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,629
You think he'd help us?

101
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,124
Don't worry.
I won't do anything stupid.

102
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:53,725
Go.

103
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,934
The name's Fortis.

104
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:06,906
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.

105
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:14,080
Do you mind if I try it on?
I think it would suit me.

106
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:17,993
I'll tell you what.

107
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,091
I'll fight you for it.

108
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,658
Come on.

109
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:28,096
I'm an old man.
Turned 75 last week.

110
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:38,675
I need a moment.

111
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,197
You ready to go?

112
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,529
Ready to go.

113
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:04,805
Let's get you out of here.

114
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,309
Get him!

115
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:13,480
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.

116
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,143
Yeah, it looked like it.

117
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:18,447
I know what I'm doing.

118
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:19,716
Run. Run!

119
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,064
Come on!

120
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,571
Here!

121
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,401
Hurry!

122
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:46,744
Move!

123
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,359
Where the hell are you going?
Get in here!

124
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,870
I know who took him.

125
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,139
I know who he is.

126
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,236
Who he was.

127
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,983
Damn it, damn it.

128
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,655
What the hell are you doing here?

129
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,590
Flashing all that?

130
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:08,890
You out of your mind?

131
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:11,492
Henry Hamilton.

132
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:15,927
Will Salas.

133
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,274
Ugh.

134
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,572
God.

135
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,512
Drink more, it gets better.

136
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,922
Not much better.

137
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,291
You'll be safe till morning.

138
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,297
I'll get you out of here.

139
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,205
You're from New Greenwich.

140
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,142
Does it show?

141
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,304
Nah.

142
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,313
Looks like you could use
some help yourself.

143
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:05,886
No, thanks.

144
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,714
How old are you?

145
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,719
In real time?

146
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:11,825
Twenty-eight.

147
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:13,887
I'm 105.

148
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,495
Good for you.

149
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,997
You won't see 106, you have
too many more nights like tonight.

150
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,169
You are right.

151
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,165
But the day comes
when you've had enough.

152
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:30,837
Your mind can be spent,
even if your body's not.

153
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,345
We want to die.

154
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,815
We need to.

155
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:45,526
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?

156
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,422
You ever known anyone who's died?

157
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,936
For a few to be immortal,
many must die.

158
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,449
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

159
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,778
You really don't know, do you?

160
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:16,954
Everyone can't live forever.
Where would we put them?

161
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,558
Why do you think there are Time Zones?

162
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,094
Why do you think
taxes and prices go up

163
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,797
the same day in the ghetto?

164
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,742
The cost of living keeps rising
to make sure people keep dying.

165
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,307
How else could there be men
with a million years

166
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,813
while most live day to day?

167
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:43,981
But the truth is

168
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,653
there's more than enough.

169
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:52,088
No one has to die before their time.

170
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,004
If you had as much time
as I have on that clock,

171
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:08,068
what would you do with it?

172
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,610
I'd stop watching it.

173
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,618
I can tell you one thing.

174
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,114
If I had all that time,

175
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,193
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.

176
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,869
Get some rest.

177
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,867
Don't worry.
I won't take it in the night.

178
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,378
And I won't take yours.

179
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:58,852
It does get better.

180
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,482
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.

181
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:06,549
Is Borel in?

182
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,384
Yeah. Borel?

183
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,120
Look at that.

184
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,986
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.

185
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,395
We could use that year right now.

186
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,555
Borel?

187
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,732
I'm here.

188
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,137
You'd better get her inside, Greta.

189
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,082
Look at this.

190
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,986
Where did you get that?

191
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,816
The guy at the bar.

192
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:45,156
They were going to kill him.

193
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,590
He gave it to me.

194
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,157
He timed himself out
before I could stop him.

195
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,668
No one gives anybody 100 years.

196
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,302
He didn't just give me this.

197
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,533
He gave me the truth about it.

198
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,302
You can't let anyone see that.

199
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:00,932
Hey.

200
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,238
You know that time
will get you killed.

201
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,681
How long have we been friends?

202
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,583
What, 10 years?

203
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:15,249
Here.

204
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,096
A decade.

205
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,066
You've been like a brother.

206
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:30,532
Where are you going?

207
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,499
Where this won't look out of place.

208
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:37,637
I finally got the time
to take my mom to New Greenwich.

209
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,795
Greta, I'm going out!

210
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:01,263
<i>Loan payment received, two days.
Thank you.</i>

211
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,035
Dayton.

212
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:12,606
Two hours.

213
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,547
It's always been an hour.

214
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,984
Now it's two. Price went up.

215
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,045
Since when?

216
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:22,718
Since today.

217
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,051
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.

218
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:28,028
I can't do that, policy.

219
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,027
Please?

220
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,233
It's a two-hour walk.

221
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,570
I have an hour and a half.

222
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,010
Then you'd better run.

223
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:20,210
Stop! Please stop!

224
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:55,741
Wait! Please! Please, no!

225
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,812
Wait! No! Please!

226
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:21,603
Mom?

227
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:22,667
Will!

228
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,615
Will!

229
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,286
- Will!
- Mom!

230
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,358
No, no, no, no!

231
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,141
No!

232
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,643
Mom, Mom, Mom!

233
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:29,938
Thirteen zeros.

234
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,003
Unlucky for all.

235
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,147
The last time anyone saw him alive,

236
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,413
there was over a century
on that clock.

237
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,412
Around here, they'd kill you for a week.

238
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,320
What was he doing in this Time Zone?

239
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:45,687
What I was thinking

240
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:49,429
was he might have brought this on himself.

241
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:52,092
Interesting.
How long you been keeping time, Jaeger?

242
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,461
Five years.

243
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,398
Let me know what you think
when you have been doing it for 50.

244
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:58,974
It doesn't matter why he came here.

245
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:02,500
What matters are the hundred years
that came with him.

246
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,909
Gotta be a witness.

247
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,013
Trust me, no one saw anything.

248
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:10,382
What would you like us to do, sir?

249
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,754
What we always do.
Follow the time.

250
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,691
Hey, Ray.
I'll give you 10 minutes for an hour.

251
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,426
When are you gonna
get out of the game, Leila?

252
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,694
You gotta be pushing 60.

253
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,699
Thanks for letting everyone know.

254
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:39,172
<i>Am I in the right place?</i>

255
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,235
We don't normally make pickups
in this Zone.

256
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,238
I was lost.

257
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,146
<i>Please deposit one month.</i>

258
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:44,773
<i>Please deposit two months.</i>

259
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:55,113
There are more of these
than I remember.

260
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,426
That was a year.

261
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:10,803
Welcome to New Greenwich.

262
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:15,307
What are you really doing here?

263
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,804
I'm going to take them
for everything they've got.

264
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,150
I'm going to make them pay.

265
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,379
Please, miss.
You can't be too careful.

266
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:33,149
Are you sure?

267
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:37,487
What's a night here cost?

268
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,528
Two months for a standard room.

269
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,391
Give me a suite.

270
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:56,970
Do you need help with your bags?

271
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:59,141
No.

272
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,084
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.

273
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:16,596
The camera doesn't show us
how the body got into the river.

274
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,429
What do we really know?

275
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:20,593
What do we know?

276
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,106
We know that most thefts in Dayton
amount to hours or days.

277
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:26,437
This was a century.

278
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,836
I don't see any more in circulation.

279
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,144
He could have capsuled the time.

280
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:34,848
You can't hide a hundred years
in the ghetto.

281
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:38,110
They can sense when a man
has a month more than he should.

282
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:42,449
The time left town.

283
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:30,067
That'll be eight and a half weeks.

284
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,831
Take a week for yourself.

285
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,670
Thanks.

286
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,580
You're not from around here,
are you?

287
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,686
You do everything a little too fast.

288
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:50,883
Not everything.

289
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,193
What's that place across the street?

290
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,424
The casino.

291
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:58,360
Can anybody go?

292
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,028
Not dressed like that.

293
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,702
Good luck.

294
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:12,438
Sir, you were right.

295
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,073
If you turn back the clocks
the day of Hamilton's death,

296
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,277
and look at the time checks,

297
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:19,321
someone spent years crossing
four different Time Zones from Dayton--

298
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:23,722
To New Greenwich.
The cameras picked up on his suspicious behavior.

299
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:25,954
He's conscious of the surveillance,

300
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:28,792
he doesn't have a bodyguard,
and he runs.

301
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,397
But if he has time,
he doesn't need to run.

302
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,568
It's a hard habit to break.

303
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:36,965
You're looking for a match?

304
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,733
His name is Will Salas.

305
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,640
You know him?

306
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:43,738
No.

307
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:46,647
I remember his father.

308
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:55,754
Good evening.

309
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,825
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.

310
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,491
Indeed it is.
However, there is a voluntary donation

311
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,262
for non-members.
Most give a year.

312
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:16,442
What's your game?

313
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:17,803
Poker.

314
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,108
Right this way.

315
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:23,007
What's the limit?

316
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,117
There is none.

317
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:42,035
I don't believe we've had the pleasure
of your company before, Mr...

318
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:43,537
Salas.

319
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:44,798
Will Salas.

320
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:49,205
Philippe Weis.
You must come from time.

321
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,440
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.

322
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:57,008
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?

323
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:02,384
I assumed I was amongst friends.

324
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,558
Bet you 50 years.

325
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,498
You must be young.

326
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,404
When you've been 25 for 85 years,
like I have,

327
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:27,744
knowing only a random act of violence
can take your life,

328
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,082
you learn to appreciate what you have.

329
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,018
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.

330
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,753
I call.

331
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,374
Of course,
some think what we have is unfair.

332
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:00,707
The time difference between Zones.

333
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,381
I've heard that.

334
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:06,043
But isn't this just the next logical step
in our evolution?

335
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:09,055
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?

336
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,752
It's always been survival of the fittest.

337
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:15,393
Raise you another two centuries.

338
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:21,293
This is merely Darwinian capitalism.

339
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,299
Natural selection.

340
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,405
Absolutely.

341
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,804
The strong survive.

342
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:31,903
And I think your hand is weak.

343
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:34,580
I call.

344
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:52,164
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.

345
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:24,423
Thirteen figures.

346
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:27,199
Well played.

347
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:30,635
That was some risk.

348
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:36,508
It wasn't a risk.

349
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:40,145
No offense.
I knew I was going to win.

350
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:43,717
Confusing times.

351
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,820
Is she my mother, my sister
or my daughter?

352
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:49,857
You're hoping she's not my wife.

353
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,493
Things used to be simpler once.
So I'm told.

354
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:57,492
Very beautiful.

355
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:00,224
Daughter.

356
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:04,332
Though she does look
a lot like my wife. Sylvia?

357
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,640
Will Salas.

358
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,176
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.

359
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:11,903
You've taken years off
my father's life.

360
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:15,415
Which is normally what you do.
Isn't that right, my darling?

361
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,010
We're having a party tomorrow night.

362
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:22,921
Perhaps you'll give him a chance
to win back some of those years.

363
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,352
I'd love to.

364
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,123
Carl will tell you where I am.

365
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:28,527
Good night, Mr. Salas.

366
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:31,192
Sylvia, stay with your guards.

367
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,712
Fifty-nine years.

368
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,076
Plus tax.

369
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:02,123
The price includes delivery.

370
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:04,123
Delivery?

371
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,724
To wherever you're going to display it.

372
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:09,564
Display it?

373
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,636
Hell, I'm going to drive it.

374
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:32,616
Will Salas.

375
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:36,929
Allow me to introduce
my mother-in-law, Clara,

376
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,931
my wife, Michele,
and my daughter, Sylvia.

377
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,832
I believe you two have already met.

378
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,597
Nice to meet you all.

379
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:48,232
I'll come find you later

380
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,005
for our game.

381
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,271
I look forward to it.

382
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,521
Having fun, Mr. Salas?

383
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:13,465
Please, call me Will.

384
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,468
It's okay, Constantin.

385
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:22,300
Do you always have a hired hand
standing right next to you?

386
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:23,868
No. I usually have two.

387
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:28,541
That doesn't make it very easy
to get to know you.

388
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,378
I think that's the idea.

389
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,143
Your idea?

390
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,279
My father's.

391
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:34,481
I understand.

392
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,482
You all have a lot to lose.

393
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:39,817
So do you.

394
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,492
What do you do, Will?

395
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,158
I haven't quite figured that out yet.

396
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,662
Yes, why bother?
What's the hurry?

397
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:56,074
Right. Why do today
what you can do in a century?

398
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,410
I know one thing we can do.

399
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,077
Dance with me.

400
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,684
Do you really come from time?

401
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,456
Why would you doubt that?

402
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,624
I saw you run.

403
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:22,126
Reminds me of people
who come from the ghetto.

404
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:27,298
Sometimes I envy them.

405
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,140
You don't know anything.

406
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:36,974
Oh, no?
The clock is good for no one.

407
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:41,987
The poor die and the rich don't live.

408
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:45,724
We can all live forever as long
as we don't do anything foolish.

409
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:51,159
Doesn't that scare you?
That maybe you'll never do anything foolish?

410
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,163
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?

411
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,170
Come with me.

412
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:18,920
This was tonight.

413
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:23,690
He's only an hour ahead of us.

414
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,363
Look at that.

415
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,373
I've never seen anything like it.

416
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,178
What are you doing?

417
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:43,279
We don't go in.

418
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:47,613
You're insane.

419
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:51,220
You have this in your backyard.
You never go in.

420
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,059
And I'm insane?

421
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:02,060
Well? What are you waiting for?

422
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:05,467
Sylvia, come on!

423
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:08,732
What happened to doing something foolish?

424
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,330
I don't know you.

425
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:35,827
We could change that.

426
00:39:38,774 --> 00:39:40,105
I get it.

427
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:44,076
You're out here, all alone,

428
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,274
with a stranger.

429
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:49,377
You can't be too careful.

430
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:51,778
Maybe you can.

431
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:54,448
Sylvia!

432
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,952
Sylvia!

433
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,968
I have to go back.

434
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,370
To what?

435
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:20,208
You should go back.

436
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,561
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I have.

437
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:37,020
She's with her guards.

438
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,332
Right behind you.

439
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,503
Thank God.

440
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,400
Now,

441
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,001
how about that game?

442
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,747
It's all right, everyone.
What's this about?

443
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:04,250
I'm sorry to have
to break up the party, Mr. Weis.

444
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,093
I just need a word with your friend.

445
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:10,862
My friend?

446
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,431
Very well.

447
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:42,730
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.

448
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:47,824
I'm Will Salas.

449
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:49,234
I know.

450
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:54,139
What are you doing in this Zone?

451
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:57,735
It's not illegal, is it?
To change Time Zones?

452
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:00,244
No, it's not illegal.

453
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,577
It's just rare.

454
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:09,749
Where did you get that?

455
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:11,152
I won it.

456
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,491
Gambling.

457
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:18,092
All of it?

458
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:24,663
No.

459
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:28,265
A man named Henry Hamilton
gave me over a century.

460
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,614
He said he didn't need it anymore.

461
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,942
He timed himself out.

462
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:40,621
Henry Hamilton was worth
thousands of years.

463
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,349
He could practically live forever.

464
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,920
You expect me to believe that
he was immortal and he wanted to die?

465
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:52,623
I don't expect you to believe it.

466
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:55,196
But it's the truth.

467
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:58,670
It was a gift.

468
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:00,702
I'm not a thief.

469
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:05,803
But, hey, if you guys
are looking for stolen time,

470
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:08,974
maybe you should arrest everyone here.

471
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:10,309
Oh, I see.

472
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:12,819
You're talking about justice.

473
00:43:14,556 --> 00:43:16,717
Well, I am a Timekeeper.

474
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,821
I don't concern myself with "justice."

475
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,492
I only concern myself
with what I can measure.

476
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,490
Seconds, minutes, hours.

477
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:30,062
I keep time.

478
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:34,398
And that time is in the wrong hands.

479
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:40,345
That time will be held,
along with you.

480
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:46,243
We'll leave you two hours
for booking and processing.

481
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:51,859
Why are you investigating a suicide?

482
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,160
There's mass murder
in the ghetto every day.

483
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:04,761
That is fascinating.

484
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:07,163
Huh.

485
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:11,107
I heard another man talk like that.

486
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:14,538
It was over 20 years ago.

487
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:20,114
You're probably too young
to remember your father.

488
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:23,714
We'll arrange safe transport.

489
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,618
This is New Greenwich, after all.

490
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:34,094
Sylvia?
Do as I say and go with the guards.

491
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,898
Oh, for God's sake, Father.
There's an army in this house.

492
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:41,300
If we can't stop one man from killing us,
we should kill ourselves.

493
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:04,729
Stop him!

494
00:45:07,502 --> 00:45:10,266
Move! Get out of the way!

495
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,169
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.

496
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,942
Thanks.

497
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:01,714
You're going to kill us!
Please just let me out!

498
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:28,540
What are you doing?

499
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:32,476
Do you even know how to drive?

500
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,745
What's there to know?

501
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:50,366
Oh, shit.

502
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,408
Give me some time.

503
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:32,913
I guess you really are from the ghetto,
after all.

504
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:36,575
What the hell do you know about
where I'm from? Give me some time.

505
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:39,317
Or you're gonna kill me,
like you killed Henry Hamilton?

506
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,119
Lend me an hour.

507
00:47:41,656 --> 00:47:42,714
I'm not giving you a second.

508
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:46,794
I should have listened to my father.

509
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:51,755
Please, take me home.
Please.

510
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:53,767
- I can't do that.
- Why?

511
00:47:54,102 --> 00:47:55,433
You're keeping me alive.

512
00:47:57,672 --> 00:47:59,003
Keep that covered.

513
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:01,973
Anybody sees it,
you're definitely dead.

514
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:38,109
Now that worked too well.

515
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,443
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.

516
00:48:40,782 --> 00:48:42,272
Look who it is.

517
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:43,950
Who it was.

518
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:48,519
He's done in minutes.

519
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,850
He'll wake up dead.
That'll be a shock.

520
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,693
Too bad. I would have preferred
to kill him more beautifully.

521
00:48:55,964 --> 00:48:57,522
The girl's still breathing.

522
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,289
She's got a decade.

523
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:01,966
Holy shit.

524
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,832
The man he stole from me
had more than a century.

525
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,041
What? We'll divide it later.

526
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,311
It's like an angel fell from the sky.

527
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:20,481
Fortis!

528
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:21,749
Leave it!

529
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:23,149
Fortis!

530
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:51,182
Look at me.

531
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:52,750
You okay?

532
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:54,348
No.

533
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:57,916
Why are you laughing?

534
00:49:59,427 --> 00:50:00,451
We're not dead.

535
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,052
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.

536
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:05,426
Where did my time go?
I have a half hour!

537
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,958
Ah.

538
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:08,434
You're lucky.

539
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:11,604
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?

540
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:12,934
That's rich, coming from you.

541
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:15,804
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess,

542
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,105
now you like the idea of sharing.

543
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:21,441
Come here.

544
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,713
Hey, don't worry.
It's not the first time I've been this broke.

545
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:28,718
Well, it's a first for me.

546
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,786
What are we going to do?

547
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,052
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.

548
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,449
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.

549
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:59,617
<i>Time transfer.</i>

550
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,093
Cutting it close again, sir.

551
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:08,589
Well, I'm still walking around.

552
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,763
Judging by the lack of dead bodies,

553
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:13,266
I have to assume they are also.

554
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:21,602
They got jacked. They couldn't
have left here with more than minutes.

555
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:23,936
He's back in his old neighborhood.

556
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:27,507
So, where do you want us to start looking?

557
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:32,348
We don't. He'll come to us.

558
00:51:52,974 --> 00:51:54,236
Borel?

559
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:59,303
Borel, open up. It's Will.

560
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:02,643
Greta.

561
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:05,680
Where's Borel?

562
00:52:06,654 --> 00:52:08,315
He's dead.

563
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:11,656
Dead? What?

564
00:52:11,893 --> 00:52:13,087
You gave him a decade.

565
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:17,190
He drank himself to death
with nine years on his clock.

566
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:18,596
Jesus Christ.

567
00:52:21,603 --> 00:52:23,070
Greta, I'm so sorry.

568
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:25,762
Goodbye, Will.

569
00:52:33,882 --> 00:52:34,906
Will, we have minutes.

570
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:36,041
Try not to act like it.

571
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:37,982
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up!

572
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:39,713
We're going to die, Will!
Do you want to die?

573
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:41,118
Shut up!

574
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:49,395
I hope those are real. Run.

575
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:02,300
Stop! Wait!

576
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,502
Please, wait!

577
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:07,137
Come back in an hour.

578
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:08,738
That won't be possible.

579
00:53:11,352 --> 00:53:12,512
Here!

580
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:28,461
I'll give you two days for them.

581
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:30,029
They're diamonds.

582
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,501
You can take the 48 hours,
or you can be a pretty corpse.

583
00:53:33,107 --> 00:53:34,267
We'll take it.

584
00:53:45,286 --> 00:53:46,651
Don't make a sound.

585
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:48,052
Give me my time.

586
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:55,885
Let's go.

587
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,496
I guess I got my wish.

588
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,694
I did do something foolish.

589
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:06,336
Your name's on a lot of buildings.

590
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:07,999
It's my father's name.

591
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:10,235
How much is he worth, anyway?

592
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:12,843
Eons.

593
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:15,182
What do you think he'd pay
to get you back?

594
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:17,680
You have no shame, do you?

595
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:24,021
<i>Please deposit one minute.</i>

596
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:27,252
Dial.

597
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:42,698
Hello.

598
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:45,712
Mr. Weis, please give the phone
to the Timekeeper.

599
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:54,544
Hello, Will.
How much do you want?

600
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,448
A thousand years.

601
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:58,956
You'll never live to spend it.

602
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:06,226
Then distribute it
to the Time Lines in Dayton.

603
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:10,067
Do it by sunrise tomorrow
and she can go home.

604
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,034
Will...

605
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:17,407
I'm afraid for you, Will.

606
00:55:17,745 --> 00:55:20,942
You keep talking like him,
you're going to die like him.

607
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:24,641
My father died in a fight,
trying to take a man's time.

608
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:27,915
Oh, no.
His crime wasn't taking time.

609
00:55:29,157 --> 00:55:31,421
<i>He was doing something
far more dangerous.</i>

610
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:35,159
Please don't make your father's mistake.

611
00:55:41,602 --> 00:55:43,331
Dayton. Pedre Plaza.

612
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:45,002
I know it.

613
00:55:46,274 --> 00:55:49,107
A thousand years to the Time Lines.

614
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:50,777
A thousand years.

615
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:54,838
It's nothing.

616
00:55:55,116 --> 00:55:56,947
It's for our daughter.

617
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:00,517
No, it's for them.

618
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,546
This is insane.

619
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:04,819
They can take your time,
just like that.

620
00:56:05,994 --> 00:56:07,655
Or you can take theirs.

621
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,486
This is insane.

622
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,497
Yeah, it's insane.

623
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:28,505
We should be safe here until dawn.

624
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:32,682
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.

625
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:39,556
This is your place?

626
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:46,094
There's water.
It's cold, but it's something.

627
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:49,529
You can put on fresh clothes.

628
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:21,929
Where's your family?

629
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,735
My mother timed out.

630
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:29,968
This is her dress.

631
00:57:30,245 --> 00:57:31,405
Yeah.

632
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,416
What about your father?

633
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:39,283
He died when I was a boy.

634
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,753
He was a fighter. Strong arm.

635
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:48,592
He wasn't the strongest,
but he knew how to win.

636
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:51,596
How do you win?

637
00:57:59,774 --> 00:58:01,105
I'll show you.

638
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:09,280
What you do is let them have
the upper hand.

639
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:13,109
Then, he'd let his time
go all the way down.

640
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:15,955
Because he knew

641
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:18,683
that when you were down
to your last seconds

642
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,291
and they think it's over,

643
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:25,129
they start watching your clock

644
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,201
and forget to watch their own.

645
00:58:46,554 --> 00:58:48,215
He died in a fight?

646
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:55,724
I think he was killed
for giving away what he won.

647
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,991
He wasn't just giving them time.

648
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,198
He was giving them hope.

649
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:06,973
How long have you been this old?

650
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:09,040
Twenty-five for three.

651
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:12,840
Twenty-five for two.

652
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,541
What was it like
when your clock started?

653
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:22,789
<i>I was in the street.</i>

654
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:24,848
<i>It almost knocked me over.</i>

655
00:59:25,526 --> 00:59:28,086
<i>My year was gone in a week,
we were so in debt.</i>

656
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:31,362
After that, I lived day to day.

657
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:35,202
Mine was a little different.

658
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:38,369
It woke me.

659
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:52,713
<i>I looked in the mirror.</i>

660
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:56,213
<i>I guess everybody does.</i>

661
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:00,784
<i>That's what you're gonna look like
for the rest of your life.</i>

662
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:04,456
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.

663
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:07,962
You must hate me.

664
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:11,561
Where I come from.

665
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,898
It's nobody's fault,
what they're born with.

666
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:37,992
They open in a minute.

667
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,828
Let's see how generous
your father is now.

668
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,361
The Timekeepers would have never
let him do it.

669
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:16,193
You don't have to say that.

670
01:01:17,305 --> 01:01:20,138
How do you think my father
built all those buildings?

671
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:22,973
By giving away a thousand years?

672
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,646
Now what?

673
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:31,884
You can go home.

674
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:35,683
There's people on the streets.

675
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:36,985
I can move without being spotted.

676
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:39,151
What have you got?

677
01:01:42,063 --> 01:01:43,394
Eleven hours.

678
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:47,331
How does anyone live like this?

679
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:48,994
You don't generally sleep in.

680
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:58,670
You can call for help.

681
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:00,814
I'll watch from here,
I'll make sure you're safe.

682
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:02,611
You know, you could fight this.

683
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:05,583
I can say that running to the ghetto
was my idea.

684
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,548
My father'd believe that,
he thinks I'm reckless.

685
01:02:10,224 --> 01:02:11,691
He has a lot of influence, Will.

686
01:02:11,759 --> 01:02:13,249
He can get you a lawyer.

687
01:02:13,361 --> 01:02:15,158
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.

688
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:17,731
I'm pretty sure that Timekeeper
doesn't make deals.

689
01:02:21,736 --> 01:02:23,567
What are you going to do?

690
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:25,069
Steal?

691
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:29,334
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

692
01:02:32,346 --> 01:02:34,678
Here. Just in case.

693
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,308
I'll be right here.

694
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:10,548
<i>Please deposit one minute.</i>

695
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:17,384
- <i>Father?</i>
- Sylvia?

696
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,786
You couldn't spare a second, Father?

697
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,792
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

698
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:28,759
Did you hear what I just said?

699
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:30,064
<i>You know I'd do anything for you.</i>

700
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:32,731
They're coming to get you.

701
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:34,635
<i>They know where you are.</i>

702
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,035
Will, look out!

703
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:56,889
Sorry to disappoint you,
we don't keep much on us.

704
01:03:58,099 --> 01:04:00,590
To discourage thieves like you.

705
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:07,167
Think of this as a gift.

706
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:10,437
Will! Come on!

707
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:34,858
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.

708
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:36,596
I think you did both.

709
01:04:37,305 --> 01:04:38,795
You could say thank you.

710
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:41,205
Thank you. What have you got?

711
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:43,875
Nine hours.

712
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:47,637
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.

713
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,982
Timekeepers live day to day.

714
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:56,216
It'll be hours before the others show up.

715
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,617
He could die in the ghetto.

716
01:04:58,693 --> 01:04:59,990
He still might.

717
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:02,485
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?

718
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,723
Stay a while.
You might like us if you got to know us!

719
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:12,095
They're going to think you're with me.

720
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:13,572
Yes.

721
01:05:15,743 --> 01:05:17,506
This is a mess.

722
01:05:17,912 --> 01:05:19,345
Welcome to my world.

723
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:24,682
Back off!

724
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,250
You've been shot.
I was worried you timed out.

725
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:32,089
Where'd you get that?

726
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,331
What are we going to do?

727
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,466
We can't keep driving around in this car.

728
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:49,736
It's a cop car.

729
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:52,506
So let's make an arrest.

730
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,299
Was I going too fast?

731
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:17,065
Not fast enough.

732
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,598
The mistake you made was stopping.

733
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:24,067
Now, let's see who you got back there.

734
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:29,212
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.

735
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:31,674
Whoa!

736
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:35,421
It went off.

737
01:06:35,756 --> 01:06:37,155
I was just trying to help.

738
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:45,425
Come on.

739
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:51,765
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life,"
but since your money is your life...

740
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,169
How dare you steal from me?

741
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:55,831
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No?

742
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,101
Think of it as repossession.

743
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:00,511
I'll leave you with what I've had most
every day of my life.

744
01:07:01,348 --> 01:07:02,838
- One day.
- One day?

745
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:05,076
Are you insane?

746
01:07:05,986 --> 01:07:06,975
You can do a lot in a day.

747
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,622
Those are pretty.

748
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:19,425
I owe you these.

749
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,127
You shouldn't have.

750
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,133
You, out.

751
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:32,877
<i>Will Salas, prime suspect
in the murder of Henry Hamilton,</i>

752
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,915
<i>is believed to be traveling
with Sylvia Weis,</i>

753
01:07:35,983 --> 01:07:38,281
<i>daughter of finance magnate,
Philippe Weis.</i>

754
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:40,616
<i>Citizens are advised
to exercise extreme--</i>

755
01:07:44,225 --> 01:07:45,988
We look cute together.

756
01:07:49,997 --> 01:07:51,828
It doesn't say you're wanted.

757
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:55,332
It doesn't say I'm not.

758
01:07:56,403 --> 01:07:58,735
You've forgotten I shot a cop.

759
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:02,066
I admit, not very well.

760
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:04,401
It was your first time.

761
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:08,170
Hey.

762
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:11,178
I can say I made you do all of it.

763
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:13,847
You can go back.

764
01:08:14,088 --> 01:08:15,749
Go back to what?

765
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:21,360
Do I really want to spend my whole life
trying not to die by mistake?

766
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:26,761
A lot of people would say
being here is a mistake.

767
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,031
I don't have a choice.

768
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,066
I'm starting to think
that I don't, either.

769
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,790
I want to reassure you all
there is no cause for alarm.

770
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:02,062
No ransom was paid.

771
01:09:02,403 --> 01:09:04,303
<i>Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.</i>

772
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:07,067
<i>It puts us at risk.
It can spread.</i>

773
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:10,074
<i>Too much time in the wrong hands
can crash the market.</i>

774
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,472
This hostage situation
will be quickly resolved.

775
01:09:12,546 --> 01:09:14,013
Sir.

776
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,151
Everything is under control.
We'll talk soon.

777
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,054
Timekeeper.
After this regrettable incident,

778
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,927
it's really not necessary
for you to come in person.

779
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:36,596
I'm afraid it really is necessary.

780
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,330
When can we hope for a rescue?

781
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:43,406
I believe that's the point.

782
01:09:43,477 --> 01:09:45,342
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.

783
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:48,604
Mr. Leon.

784
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:52,847
Raymond. May I call you Raymond?

785
01:09:55,122 --> 01:09:56,680
I blame myself.

786
01:09:57,691 --> 01:09:59,716
I invited the man into my home.

787
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:01,784
He had so much time,
how was I supposed to know?

788
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:07,965
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself
by her lack of vigilance.

789
01:10:08,535 --> 01:10:11,026
That's why I always tried
to keep her close.

790
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,973
But she is clearly
under Will Salas' control.

791
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:26,016
If it's a matter of resources,

792
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:29,021
I'm happy to make a contribution.

793
01:10:30,824 --> 01:10:33,054
It's a scandal,
what we pay our Timekeepers.

794
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,991
I've issued a warrant
for your daughter's arrest.

795
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:42,227
If she contacts you
and you assist her in any way,

796
01:10:42,336 --> 01:10:44,167
I will issue a warrant for your arrest.

797
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:57,848
There is nothing I cannot buy.

798
01:11:00,187 --> 01:11:01,245
Now...

799
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,751
how many of my years do you want?

800
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,851
There aren't enough years,

801
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:14,160
even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis.
Good night.

802
01:11:19,373 --> 01:11:21,534
This is called a trigger.

803
01:11:22,242 --> 01:11:25,575
And you don't pull it until
you actually want to shoot something.

804
01:11:32,686 --> 01:11:33,948
I wanted to shoot something.

805
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:35,045
Right.

806
01:11:39,593 --> 01:11:41,561
Will, if you get a lot of time,

807
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,126
are you really gonna give it away?

808
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:48,097
I've only ever had a day.

809
01:11:49,036 --> 01:11:50,594
How much do you need?

810
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,700
How can you live with yourself
watching people die

811
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:54,866
right next to you?

812
01:11:56,443 --> 01:11:58,035
You don't watch.

813
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,870
You close your eyes.

814
01:12:10,557 --> 01:12:12,718
I can help you get all the time you want.

815
01:12:20,267 --> 01:12:22,861
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?

816
01:12:23,604 --> 01:12:25,367
Today's rate, 30%.

817
01:12:26,607 --> 01:12:28,097
I can't pay it back.

818
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,536
We can always come to some arrangement.

819
01:12:56,303 --> 01:12:57,463
Let's go.

820
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:03,771
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to announce that Weis Timelenders

821
01:13:03,844 --> 01:13:06,779
is now offering interest-free loans
with no payments.

822
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:07,905
Ever.

823
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:09,471
So help yourselves and take a day.

824
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:11,140
Take a month.
Hell, take a year.

825
01:13:11,318 --> 01:13:13,411
Come on. Help yourselves!
Take it.

826
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:14,954
Take the time. It's free.

827
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:52,518
No one's watching their clocks, huh?

828
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:55,392
Get out of here,
or I'll confiscate every second!

829
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,565
Must've thought it was a drive-through.

830
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:38,493
Turn around.

831
01:14:39,072 --> 01:14:40,096
Don't move.

832
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:41,766
I don't have much.

833
01:14:41,842 --> 01:14:43,400
Everything I have, I give away.

834
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,499
I know.

835
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,691
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.

836
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:12,365
There are years that shouldn't be there.

837
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,371
I will stop him, sir.

838
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,607
Doesn't he understand

839
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:24,116
he's hurting the very people
he's trying to help?

840
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:35,125
Well, now.

841
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:38,064
- Look at all that.
- Yeah.

842
01:15:38,732 --> 01:15:40,563
I finally had time to buy one of these.

843
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:44,966
Let's not do anything I might regret.

844
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:20,334
What was that about?

845
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,641
I wasted 30 days.

846
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:26,304
<i>Today, Sylvia Weis withdrew
some of her "inheritance"</i>

847
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,848
<i>when she and Will Salas
robbed her father's time bank</i>

848
01:16:28,949 --> 01:16:31,509
<i>for the sixth time in a week.</i>

849
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:33,341
I give her everything.

850
01:16:35,022 --> 01:16:36,614
Does she want to kill me?

851
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:38,680
You were killing her, Philippe.

852
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:42,622
You were suffocating her.

853
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:46,526
You suffocate us all.

854
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:52,363
Call.

855
01:16:58,645 --> 01:16:59,976
That's good.

856
01:17:00,547 --> 01:17:03,038
Just not as good as that.

857
01:17:03,116 --> 01:17:04,105
Ooh!

858
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,310
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.

859
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:10,220
Why did I play strip poker with you?

860
01:17:10,824 --> 01:17:12,314
Why did you?

861
01:17:18,532 --> 01:17:19,590
Sir.

862
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:21,566
They're still there.

863
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:24,828
How did you know, sir?

864
01:17:25,906 --> 01:17:28,238
This is where the hours and the days are.

865
01:17:30,243 --> 01:17:32,336
He's paid them all off.

866
01:17:33,246 --> 01:17:34,679
This is where I would hide.

867
01:17:42,589 --> 01:17:44,079
Put your clothes on.

868
01:17:51,064 --> 01:17:52,395
Stop!

869
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:56,032
- We're trapped!
- No, we're not!

870
01:17:57,604 --> 01:17:59,094
Jump. They won't do it.

871
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:00,264
We shouldn't do it.

872
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:08,207
Come on!

873
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:19,283
See? They won't jump.

874
01:18:22,295 --> 01:18:23,421
So much for your theory.

875
01:18:23,497 --> 01:18:24,725
Shit!

876
01:18:40,947 --> 01:18:42,107
Here!

877
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:43,674
Go!

878
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:49,515
Stop! Stop!

879
01:19:07,407 --> 01:19:08,931
I'm telling you,
he'll give up before we do!

880
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:10,169
You sure about that?

881
01:19:11,678 --> 01:19:13,009
No.

882
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:32,862
- Go.
- I can't.

883
01:19:32,966 --> 01:19:34,365
You can! Go!

884
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,096
Un-fucking-believable!

885
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:53,981
Hold on.

886
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,253
You two look familiar.

887
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:00,719
How about now?

888
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,353
Welcome to the Century.

889
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:31,690
Hi. We're looking
for a quiet place to stay.

890
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:33,483
How many rooms?

891
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:35,151
All of them.

892
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:37,623
We were hoping for something long-term.

893
01:20:38,365 --> 01:20:41,198
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?

894
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:43,425
I'm sure you can.

895
01:20:52,212 --> 01:20:54,043
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.

896
01:20:56,116 --> 01:20:57,447
Right.

897
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,951
Nobody goes anywhere!

898
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:10,251
Wait, whoa, whoa.

899
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:13,054
Don't look at me.

900
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:16,564
You know who I'm looking for.

901
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:25,074
I'm looking for whoever
gave this man a month!

902
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,473
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off
of every one of you in this hellhole

903
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:36,113
until someone says something
I want to hear.

904
01:21:43,663 --> 01:21:44,994
I can't hear anything.

905
01:21:49,436 --> 01:21:50,596
Clean it.

906
01:21:52,472 --> 01:21:54,838
No, wait, wait. Wait. Please!

907
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:58,268
Please don't. Please.
I don't know where they are!

908
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:00,638
Please.

909
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:04,078
Please!

910
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:05,978
Please.

911
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:16,161
I believe you're next.

912
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:17,752
Um...

913
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:22,497
At last, someone's acting reasonably.

914
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:24,903
I just want a share of the reward.

915
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:35,508
My young friend.

916
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:39,174
You'll get your reward.

917
01:22:47,193 --> 01:22:48,524
Ten years.

918
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:54,260
That's insulting.

919
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:02,034
If they catch us,

920
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:06,607
there's no way they won't kill us,
is there?

921
01:23:09,215 --> 01:23:10,705
Do you regret this?

922
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:13,716
You saved my life.

923
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:17,216
When?

924
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,287
Now.

925
01:23:21,227 --> 01:23:23,218
And every day since I met you.

926
01:23:27,901 --> 01:23:30,631
You forget, I almost got you killed
a few times, too.

927
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:35,234
I'm willing to overlook that.

928
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:53,586
How's the poor little rich girl?

929
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:56,228
I never got a chance to...

930
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:59,591
properly thank you for your time.

931
01:24:01,267 --> 01:24:03,258
I'm not surprised you stayed.

932
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:06,102
It's the life, isn't it?

933
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:09,105
Here we don't stop living

934
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:12,275
until we're actually dead.

935
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:15,877
There are a lot more ways
to die around here.

936
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:19,775
But here, there's dancing before dying.

937
01:24:27,627 --> 01:24:31,358
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.

938
01:24:31,798 --> 01:24:35,131
You've been causing a lot of trouble,
which is normally my job.

939
01:24:35,535 --> 01:24:36,729
Don't you understand?

940
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:42,300
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone
is 'cause I have boundaries.

941
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,866
I steal from my own people.

942
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:49,478
You surely know things are bad
when I have to restore order.

943
01:24:52,485 --> 01:24:56,649
Fortunately for you,
I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.

944
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:58,483
I do it,

945
01:24:58,992 --> 01:25:02,655
but I prefer not to.

946
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,061
I think you deserve a fighting chance.

947
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,742
We play to zero.

948
01:25:22,749 --> 01:25:24,239
What's the point?

949
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:28,514
I lose, I die.
I win, they kill me.

950
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:33,019
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.

951
01:25:33,593 --> 01:25:34,617
And her?

952
01:25:36,029 --> 01:25:37,587
After I take you,

953
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:39,589
I'll take her.

954
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:45,701
Oh, yeah. And her time.

955
01:25:47,273 --> 01:25:48,831
Then I'll collect my reward

956
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,376
for making everything right in the world.

957
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:14,315
This way!

958
01:27:22,335 --> 01:27:24,496
All the time he's taken.

959
01:27:25,338 --> 01:27:27,101
Don't you mean the time
he's given away, sir?

960
01:27:30,176 --> 01:27:31,575
Even to you?

961
01:27:39,352 --> 01:27:44,187
I have given 50 years of my life
to this job.

962
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:48,016
I am not about to see
those years go to waste.

963
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:51,260
Go on.

964
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,544
I'm sorry to be the one
to break this to you,

965
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:13,112
but by tomorrow...

966
01:28:13,386 --> 01:28:15,115
you won't have time to stand around.

967
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:35,401
God damn it.

968
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:40,576
It's over.

969
01:28:40,913 --> 01:28:42,813
We lost.
We're not doing any good.

970
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:44,377
At least we're trying.

971
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:49,752
No. You don't understand. All they have to do
is keep raising the cost of living.

972
01:28:50,089 --> 01:28:53,752
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.

973
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:55,585
So, what?
We just stop fighting?

974
01:28:55,828 --> 01:28:58,558
We can't win.
We can't hurt them.

975
01:28:58,631 --> 01:29:00,565
The time we're taking
makes no damn difference!

976
01:29:00,633 --> 01:29:02,760
What would?
What would hurt them?

977
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:06,931
A million years.
You got a million years on you?

978
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:13,601
I guess it really would take a million years.

979
01:29:17,683 --> 01:29:18,945
Let's give up.

980
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:47,042
Stop!

981
01:29:48,714 --> 01:29:50,147
I am Sylvia Weis.

982
01:29:52,485 --> 01:29:54,146
I want to surrender,

983
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:56,448
but only to my father.

984
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,184
Sylvia.

985
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:05,797
Hello, Daddy.

986
01:30:08,634 --> 01:30:09,726
Stay where you are!

987
01:30:11,737 --> 01:30:14,001
You've hired more guards
since I last saw you.

988
01:30:14,107 --> 01:30:15,404
Thanks to you, I need them.

989
01:30:16,008 --> 01:30:17,339
One too many.

990
01:30:19,045 --> 01:30:20,273
Guns down.

991
01:30:21,848 --> 01:30:23,008
Now!

992
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:24,805
Do it.

993
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:37,124
Let's go for a ride.

994
01:30:44,537 --> 01:30:46,698
You'd steal from your own father.

995
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:49,530
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

996
01:31:04,223 --> 01:31:05,690
What's the combination?

997
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,726
Well, it's not my birthday.

998
01:31:08,794 --> 01:31:11,957
You've started to regret that day,
I imagine, Father.

999
01:31:13,232 --> 01:31:15,894
Try 12-2-18-09.

1000
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,233
Darwin's birthday.

1001
01:31:21,307 --> 01:31:23,070
Survival of the fittest.

1002
01:31:25,545 --> 01:31:28,446
It cost us centuries
just to bribe our way in here.

1003
01:31:29,248 --> 01:31:30,738
Let's see what it got us.

1004
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:49,257
Quality time.

1005
01:31:51,103 --> 01:31:53,765
There really is a man
with a million years.

1006
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:56,672
That's my first million.
It won't be my last.

1007
01:31:56,776 --> 01:31:58,107
You know how much good it could do?

1008
01:31:58,177 --> 01:32:00,111
I know how much harm it could do.

1009
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:02,977
Try to understand,
even if you gave a year to a million people,

1010
01:32:03,049 --> 01:32:04,448
you're just prolonging their agony.

1011
01:32:04,517 --> 01:32:06,451
You're prolonging their lives.

1012
01:32:06,953 --> 01:32:10,946
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million years,
it could cripple the system.

1013
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:12,354
Let's hope so.

1014
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:16,622
We're not meant to live like this.
We're not meant to live forever.

1015
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:21,762
Although I do wonder, Father,
if you've ever lived a day in your life.

1016
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:26,635
Is that so?
You might upset the balance for a generation.

1017
01:32:27,139 --> 01:32:28,299
Two.

1018
01:32:29,308 --> 01:32:32,300
But don't fool yourself.
In the end, nothing will change.

1019
01:32:33,145 --> 01:32:35,136
Because everyone wants to live forever.

1020
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:39,450
They all think they have
a chance at immortality

1021
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:40,849
even though all the evidence is against it.

1022
01:32:42,989 --> 01:32:45,082
They all think they will be the exception.

1023
01:32:45,157 --> 01:32:47,648
But the truth is,

1024
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:50,121
for a few to be immortal,
many must die.

1025
01:33:06,512 --> 01:33:09,345
No one should be immortal

1026
01:33:10,182 --> 01:33:12,412
if even one person has to die.

1027
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:28,598
What was that?

1028
01:33:29,368 --> 01:33:31,859
What was that?
What just happened?

1029
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:36,931
It must be a mistake. A million years
just went off the clock in New Greenwich.

1030
01:33:37,043 --> 01:33:38,271
It's not a mistake.

1031
01:33:38,544 --> 01:33:39,533
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.

1032
01:33:39,612 --> 01:33:40,772
It's not a mistake.

1033
01:33:42,515 --> 01:33:43,573
It's them.

1034
01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:49,612
Take a month, Maurice.

1035
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:08,330
Dispatch, what can you see?

1036
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:10,034
<i>There's a lot of traffic
in the vicinity, sir.</i>

1037
01:34:10,109 --> 01:34:12,339
All right, look for the slowest car.

1038
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:17,916
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.

1039
01:34:20,586 --> 01:34:22,247
If this works...

1040
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:24,752
If this works, we gotta get more.

1041
01:34:25,157 --> 01:34:27,819
Dayton's not the only zone
that can use a few extra years.

1042
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:32,587
And wire me my per diem.

1043
01:34:32,665 --> 01:34:34,155
Wait. Never mind.

1044
01:34:34,266 --> 01:34:35,597
I have him.

1045
01:34:43,275 --> 01:34:45,266
Give the order, shoot on sight.

1046
01:34:45,344 --> 01:34:47,505
<i>In New Greenwich?
That's against policy, sir.</i>

1047
01:34:47,613 --> 01:34:49,843
So is having a million years
leave the Zone.

1048
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,998
That time cannot leave the Zone!
Shoot on sight!

1049
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,452
<i>Please deposit one month.
Please deposit one month.</i>

1050
01:35:51,076 --> 01:35:52,703
Keep going! Keep going!

1051
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:53,836
We're close!

1052
01:35:54,413 --> 01:35:55,744
We're okay! We're okay!

1053
01:36:10,262 --> 01:36:11,286
You're late.

1054
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:14,791
Need a minute?

1055
01:36:17,536 --> 01:36:18,935
Go. Go.

1056
01:36:20,206 --> 01:36:21,798
Where's our capsule?

1057
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:23,367
Too late.

1058
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:30,473
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.

1059
01:36:30,883 --> 01:36:32,714
Looks like you're about out yourself.

1060
01:36:36,188 --> 01:36:37,382
- Time!
- There's time!

1061
01:36:37,456 --> 01:36:38,480
Move!

1062
01:36:55,574 --> 01:36:56,905
Move!

1063
01:37:00,913 --> 01:37:03,404
You, get out! Get out!

1064
01:37:19,598 --> 01:37:21,429
We gotta get to Livingston.

1065
01:37:23,269 --> 01:37:24,566
We can make it.

1066
01:37:24,637 --> 01:37:25,763
Can we?

1067
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,440
You okay?

1068
01:38:02,207 --> 01:38:03,538
Stop!

1069
01:38:10,316 --> 01:38:11,442
You can run.

1070
01:38:13,552 --> 01:38:14,951
So can you.

1071
01:38:17,656 --> 01:38:19,453
You're from here, aren't you?

1072
01:38:21,994 --> 01:38:23,518
Long time ago.

1073
01:38:24,096 --> 01:38:25,085
Yeah.

1074
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:27,464
I worked out how to escape.

1075
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:30,065
And now you make sure
no one else does.

1076
01:38:30,135 --> 01:38:31,659
That's the way it has to be.

1077
01:38:33,505 --> 01:38:35,336
I didn't start the clock.

1078
01:38:36,842 --> 01:38:38,469
I can't turn it back.

1079
01:38:40,012 --> 01:38:41,343
I keep it running.

1080
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:43,478
I keep time.

1081
01:38:44,683 --> 01:38:46,344
"I keep time."

1082
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:53,317
I'm gonna need some of that time
you borrowed from me.

1083
01:38:56,028 --> 01:38:59,088
Unless you want us to die
on the way to our execution.

1084
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:05,033
Time.

1085
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:28,782
We don't have enough.

1086
01:39:32,231 --> 01:39:34,290
One of us can make it. Take mine.

1087
01:39:34,566 --> 01:39:37,535
You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there. You can.

1088
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:39,867
- No. No.
- Yes!

1089
01:39:41,407 --> 01:39:42,567
Please.

1090
01:39:42,908 --> 01:39:44,068
No.

1091
01:39:53,752 --> 01:39:55,083
There's time.

1092
01:39:55,521 --> 01:39:57,955
- What?
- The Keeper's time. Run. Run!

1093
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,331
Run!

1094
01:40:23,115 --> 01:40:24,104
I need time.

1095
01:40:24,183 --> 01:40:25,946
<i>Time transfer.</i>

1096
01:40:49,608 --> 01:40:50,939
What have we got?

1097
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:53,373
A day.

1098
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:55,510
Could do a lot in a day.

1099
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:13,293
Sir, do something.

1100
01:41:15,134 --> 01:41:16,795
It's already done.

1101
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:19,864
<i>These are live pictures from Dayton.</i>

1102
01:41:19,938 --> 01:41:22,065
<i>Citizens have taken to the streets.</i>

1103
01:41:22,174 --> 01:41:24,665
<i>There's so much stolen time in circulation.</i>

1104
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:26,807
<i>Factories in Dayton lie idle.</i>

1105
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:29,172
<i>And now, citizens are crossing Zones,</i>

1106
01:41:29,248 --> 01:41:30,715
<i>seen here entering New Greenwich.</i>

1107
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,841
<i>While authorities claim
they have the situation</i>

1108
01:41:33,919 --> 01:41:38,185
<i>under control, others fear the system
may be headed for collapse.</i>

1109
01:41:38,257 --> 01:41:41,283
<i>We will continue to update you
on this developing story.</i>

1110
01:41:41,693 --> 01:41:43,388
Sir, we lost Zone Eight.

1111
01:41:43,462 --> 01:41:44,486
And Ten.

1112
01:41:48,834 --> 01:41:50,392
It's spreading.

1113
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,298
What do we do, sir?

1114
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,171
Go home.

1115
01:42:04,683 --> 01:42:08,949
<i>Still no sign of fugitives
Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.</i>

1116
01:42:09,054 --> 01:42:11,614
<i>Authorities continue to ask
for the public's help</i>

1117
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,716
<i>in bringing these criminals to justice.</i>

1118
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:35,440
Told you there were bigger banks.

1119
01:42:37,382 --> 01:42:38,713
You almost missed your calling.
