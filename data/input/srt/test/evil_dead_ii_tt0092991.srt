1
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,102
Legend has it that it was written
by the Dark Ones.

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,307
'Necronomicon Ex Mortes'.

3
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,026
Roughly translated
'Book of the Dead'.

4
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:36,986
The book served as a passageway
to the evil worlds beyond.

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,498
It was written long ago,

6
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,620
when the seas ran red with blood.

7
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:53,294
This blood was used to ink the book.

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:03,555
In the year 1300 A. D.
The book disappeared.

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,997
EVIL DEAD I I

10
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:41,847
So, what's this place like?
It's a little rundown, but...

11
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:46,811
It's right up in the mountains.
Are you sure it's converted?

12
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,555
I think so.

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,067
What do you think, kid?

14
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,364
I love it, Ash.

15
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:54,162
I feel funny about being here.
What if the owners come home?

16
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:59,797
We'll tell them the car broke down.
With your car, they'd believe it.

17
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:06,472
What about some champagne, baby?

18
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,180
After all, I'm a man and you're
a woman. At least, the last time.

19
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,832
There's a tape recorder here.
See what's on it.

20
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:46,055
This is Professor Raymond Knowby
log entry number two.

21
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:51,804
I believe I made a significant find
in the castle of Kandar.

22
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:59,110
Having journeyed there with my wife
my daughter and Prof. Gatly,

23
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:05,032
it was in the rear chamber that we
stumbled upon something remarkable.

24
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:11,038
'Naturum de Monto'
the Book of the Dead.

25
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:19,708
We brought the book here
where I could study it undisturbed.

26
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:27,879
Here I began the translations. The
book speaks of a spiritual presence.

27
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:33,764
A thing of evil that
roams the forests.

28
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:41,101
Through recitation of the book
this spirit is given license

29
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,815
to possess the living.

30
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:51,663
Here are the pronunciations
of those passages.

31
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:56,537
Kanda. Estrata. Amantos...

32
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,643
Linda?

33
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,929
Linda...

34
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,706
They're gone.

35
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:58,464
The sun's driven them away.

36
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:06,673
For now...

37
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:12,557
Better pull out of here
before nightfall.

38
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:27,862
Join us!

39
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,444
Oh, my God!

40
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:26,931
I gotta get a grip on myself here.

41
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,553
Thank you.

42
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:31,111
Annie!
How did the expedition go?

43
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:36,442
Great. I found the pages
of the Book of the Dead.

44
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:40,653
What condition are they in?
Take a look.

45
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:46,075
They haven't aged in 3000 years. When
do we begin translations?

46
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,204
Tonight. Is it all set with my father?

47
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,258
I haven't spoken with him in a week.
There's no phone in the cabin.

48
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,965
It'll take an hour to get there.

49
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:03,685
You hinted that your father was
onto something with his translation.

50
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:07,639
What has he found?
Probably nothing.

51
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:12,230
Butjust possibly
the doorway to another world.

52
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:40,810
You tricked me.

53
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,529
Yeah, just...

54
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,198
Hello, lover.

55
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,771
Work shed.

56
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:41,930
Even now we have
your darling Linda's soul,

57
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,476
she suffers in torment.

58
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:49,270
You're going down.

59
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,523
Chainsaw.

60
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:45,413
Please, Ash.
Please, don't hurt me.

61
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:51,589
You swore that we'd always
be together. I love you.

62
00:21:54,011 --> 00:22:00,760
Yes! Your love was a lie.
And now she burns in hell.

63
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:40,790
I'm fine...

64
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:43,211
I'm fine.

65
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:52,135
I don't think so. We just cut up
our girlfriend with a chainsaw.

66
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:56,809
Does that sound fine?

67
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:58,996
You bastards!

68
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:02,172
You dirty bastards!

69
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:13,883
Give me back my hand.

70
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,890
Give me back my hand!

71
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:51,173
Ex cuse me.

72
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:04,025
Ex cuse me...
Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

73
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,903
That's right. And you ain't going.
And why not?

74
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:24,747
There must be another way in.
A road or something.

75
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:28,423
Sure ain't no road.

76
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:35,344
Why the hell
do you want to go there?

77
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:45,230
None of your business.

78
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:54,699
I just remembered...
There is a trail.

79
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:59,532
You could follow Bobby Joe and me.
Sounds all right.

80
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:03,705
But it'll cost you.
How much?

81
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:08,042
45... A hundred bucks.

82
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:14,088
Tell you what: You take my bags
and you got a deal.

83
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:20,893
Sure!

84
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:15,795
That's right.
Who's laughing now?

85
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:26,635
Who's laughing now?

86
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:19,477
Jesus Christ. I thought she was
talking about them little bags.

87
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:34,576
Here's your new home.

88
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,719
You son of a...

89
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:41,284
Gotcha, didn't I, you little sucker?

90
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,364
I'll blow your butts to Kingdom Come!

91
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,242
See if we don't...

92
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:14,249
Hit him!
You dirty bastard.

93
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:30,142
You gonna be all right, honey?
I don't know. I think so.

94
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:35,439
Sit still for a minute.
You know this son of a bitch?

95
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:42,196
We thought our father would be here.
Where are my parents?

96
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:59,634
What the hell did you do to them?

97
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:03,883
Annie, come here! Come here!

98
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,436
Let's throw him in there.

99
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,691
Crazy buck's gone blood simple.

100
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,233
I am...
I made a mistake.

101
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:31,239
Wait, wait. No!
I made a mistake.

102
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,999
Damn right, you son of a bitch!

103
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:48,134
I hope you rot down there.

104
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:59,308
Oh, shit!
Everything's gonna be fine.

105
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:04,279
I'm gonna go fetch the sheriff
and bring him...

106
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:09,492
I checked all the rooms.
Your folks aren't here.

107
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,949
But these are my father's things.

108
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:20,163
It's been a few hours since I
translated the demon passages

109
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:23,673
from the Book of the Dead.

110
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,055
This is my father's voice.

111
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:34,309
I fear that my wife has become host
to a Kandarian demon.

112
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:40,274
May God forgive me
for what I have unleashed.

113
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,687
Last night
Henrietta tried to kill me.

114
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,612
It's October 1 st, 4:33 p.m.

115
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:56,159
Henrietta is dead.

116
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:02,373
I couldn't dismember her corpse.
I dragged her downstairs

117
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:06,166
and I buried her.

118
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:10,093
I buried her in the cellar.
God help me,

119
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:15,852
I buried her in the earthen floor
of the fruit cellar.

120
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:26,519
What the hell was that?
Somebody's with him.

121
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:32,949
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Someone's in my fruit cellar.

122
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:40,535
Someone with a fresh soul.
Let me out!

123
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:45,041
There's something down here!
It's a trick.

124
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:48,633
Let him out!
Move it!

125
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,756
Open up.
Come to me.

126
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:57,340
Help!
Come to sweet Henrietta.

127
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:09,652
Help me, please!

128
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,240
I'll swallow your soul!

129
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:43,456
There's something out there.

130
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,911
That witch in the cellar
is only part of it.

131
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:57,637
It lives out in those woods.

132
00:42:57,972 --> 00:43:00,973
In the dark...

133
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:04,760
Something...

134
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:09,184
Something that's come back
from the dead.

135
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:12,775
Jake, let's get out of here!
We're going, baby...

136
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:16,066
Nobody goes until daylight!
You listen to me...

137
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:20,156
Hush, little baby
don't say a word

138
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:24,362
Momma's gonna buy you
a mocking bird

139
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:33,711
If that mocking bird don't sing
Momma will buy you a diamond ring

140
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,343
If that diamond ring turns brass

141
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:43,175
Momma's gonna buy you
a looking glass

142
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:49,022
Remember that song, Annie?
I used to sing it to you.

143
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:54,149
Mother?
Unlock these chains. Quickly.

144
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:09,740
No.
You were born September 2nd, 1962.

145
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:14,415
I remember it well
because it was snowing.

146
00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:20,629
So strange it would be snowing
in September.

147
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:25,882
That thing in the cellar
is not my mother.

148
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:39,062
We are the things that were
and shall be again.

149
00:44:39,406 --> 00:44:45,491
Spirits of the Book.
We want what is yours: Life.

150
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:51,454
Dead by dawn.
Dead by dawn...

151
00:44:51,793 --> 00:44:56,123
Dead by dawn...

152
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,855
Let me out!

153
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:27,533
Where are you going?
Help us, you fucking coward!

154
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:32,205
Set me free.

155
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:53,598
We live! We live still!

156
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:36,261
That's funny.
What?

157
00:46:36,606 --> 00:46:42,644
That trail we came in here on.
Itjust ain't there no more.

158
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,900
Like the witches swallowed her up.

159
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:17,808
It's so quiet.

160
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:04,604
What the hell was that?

161
00:48:04,943 --> 00:48:10,186
Maybe something trying
to force its way into our world.

162
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,096
It's in there.

163
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,017
We'll all go in together.
Hell, no! You're the curious one.

164
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:16,339
I'll go with you.

165
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,856
Shit! I told you
there weren't nothin' in here.

166
00:50:39,388 --> 00:50:44,975
Holy mother of mercy.
Father?

167
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:53,222
There is a dark spirit here
that wants to destroy you.

168
00:50:53,527 --> 00:50:57,394
Your salvation lies there.

169
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:08,036
The pages of the Book...

170
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:13,500
Recite the passages...
Dispel the evil.

171
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,753
Save my soul...

172
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:21,462
And your own...

173
00:51:32,732 --> 00:51:39,269
You're holding my hand too tight.
Baby, I ain't holding your hand.

174
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:03,338
Where's Bobby Joe?

175
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,949
Hey...
Where the hell is she?

176
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:17,051
We gotta go out and find her.
In those woods, forget about her.

177
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:25,484
What's wrong?

178
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:31,277
Like something just walked
over my grave.

179
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,700
That picture, what is that?

180
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,292
In 1300 A. D., they called this man
the 'Hero from the Sky'.

181
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:50,427
He was prophesied to destroy evil.
He didn't do a very good job.

182
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:54,555
Can you find it?

183
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,806
Here it is. Two passages.

184
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:06,731
Recitation of this first passage

185
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:13,404
will make this dark spirit
manifest itself in the flesh.

186
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:19,495
Why the hell would we want that?
The second passage...

187
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:24,044
...creates a rift in time and space.

188
00:55:24,379 --> 00:55:29,456
The physical manifestation
can be forced back into the rift.

189
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:33,170
That's the best translation I can...

190
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:40,518
That's right...
I'm running the show now.

191
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:45,811
We're gonna look for Bobby Joe
and then we're getting out of here!

192
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:51,939
No, you idiot! It will kill us all.

193
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:57,821
She's dead. Don't you understand?
With these pages,

194
00:55:58,162 --> 00:56:02,705
at least we have a chance.

195
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:07,869
Bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit!

196
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:11,797
These pages don't mean squat!

197
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:24,010
Besides, now you ain't got no choice.
Now move!

198
00:56:33,948 --> 00:56:37,897
Move!
I said 'move'!

199
00:56:38,244 --> 00:56:41,494
You stupid fool!

200
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:49,747
I'll blow your fucking head off!

201
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:40,095
No trail.
Where to now?

202
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,569
Bobby Joe!

203
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:07,574
Bobby Joe!
You'll get us all killed!

204
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:11,581
Leave him alone!
Get out of here!

205
00:58:24,182 --> 00:58:28,678
Bobby Joe?
Where are you, girl?

206
00:58:58,424 --> 00:59:02,339
You're ours!

207
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,406
No.

208
01:01:49,469 --> 01:01:51,296
I'm sorry.

209
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:55,635
Get me in the other room. Get the axe.
We'll kill him when he comes back.

210
01:01:55,975 --> 01:02:00,388
But first
pull this damn thing out of me!

211
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:19,033
I can't breathe. Hurry.
I'm trying. I'm trying!

212
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:34,543
Shut up! Shut up!

213
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,625
Check out... beside the window.

214
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:06,996
Check the windows
he's probably...

215
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:12,708
Help me!

216
01:03:40,245 --> 01:03:42,867
Oh, God!

217
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,876
No, wait!

218
01:05:22,138 --> 01:05:25,970
Listen to me!
I'm all right now.

219
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:29,345
That thing is gone.

220
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:45,367
Dammit! I said I was all right!
Are you listening?

221
01:05:45,703 --> 01:05:51,409
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I'm all right!

222
01:05:56,005 --> 01:06:02,624
I'm all right.
Okay, maybe you are.

223
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,553
But for how long?

224
01:06:08,684 --> 01:06:14,390
If we're gonna beat this thing
we need those pages.

225
01:06:15,816 --> 01:06:21,273
Then let's head into that cellar
and carve ourselves a witch.

226
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:11,611
Groovy.

227
01:07:54,748 --> 01:07:58,532
Those pages are down there somewhere.

228
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:38,617
The pages, quick!

229
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:05,553
Nosferatos, Kalamimnon, Kanda!

230
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:02,525
Let's go.

231
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:38,522
Swallow your soul
I'll swallow your soul.

232
01:12:56,755 --> 01:13:00,290
Hush little baby
don't say a word

233
01:13:00,634 --> 01:13:06,719
Momma's gonna buy you a...
a mocking bird

234
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,829
I'll swallow your soul
I'll swallow your soul...

235
01:13:35,502 --> 01:13:38,207
Swallow this.

236
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:11,128
I only completed
the first passages!

237
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:15,885
That was to make the evil
a thing of the flesh.

238
01:15:20,898 --> 01:15:23,685
You didn't finish it?

239
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:27,894
There's still the second passage...

240
01:15:31,284 --> 01:15:37,156
The one to send the evil back.
Start reciting it! Now!

241
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:53,047
Don't look, Annie!
Finish the passages! Get rid of it!

242
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:57,552
Kanda! Amandat!

243
01:16:37,349 --> 01:16:43,304
Nosferatos! Amantos! Akadiv!

244
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:12,999
We've won!
Victory is ours!

245
01:17:23,478 --> 01:17:27,476
Kanda...

246
01:17:47,043 --> 01:17:52,286
You did it, kid. By God...

247
01:18:23,788 --> 01:18:28,699
For God's sake...
How do you stop it?

248
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:41,858
Slay the beast.
'Tis a deadite.

249
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,655
Run for the castle!

250
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:32,324
Hail he who has come from the skies
to deliver us from the deadites!
