00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,125
<i>[ Woman ] Last night
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

2
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>It seemed to me I stood by the
iron gate leading to the drive,</i>

3
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>and for a while
I could not enter...</i>

4
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>for the way was barred to me.</i>

5
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,725
<i>Then, like all dreamers,</i>

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>I was possessed of a sudden
with supernatural powers...</i>

7
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:02,040
<i>and passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me.</i>

8
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,925
<i>The drive wound away
in front of me,</i>

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,245
<i>twisting and turning
as it had always done.</i>

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>But as I advanced, I was aware
that a change had come upon it.</i>

11
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:15,525
<i>Nature had come
into her own again,</i>

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>and little by little
had encroached upon the drive...</i>

13
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,960
<i>with long, tenacious fiingers.</i>

14
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,840
<i>On and on wound the poor thread
that had once been our drive,</i>

15
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,417
<i>and fiinally
there was Manderley.</i>

16
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,805
<i>Manderley-
secretive and silent.</i>

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
<i>Time could not mar the perfect
symmetry of those walls.</i>

18
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>Moonlight can play
odd tricks upon the fancy,</i>

19
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,760
<i>and suddenly it seemed to me that light
came from the windows.</i>

20
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,160
<i>And then a cloud
came upon the moon...</i>

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,640
<i>and hovered an instant
like a dark hand before a face.</i>

22
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,960
<i>The illusion went with it.</i>

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,325
<i>I looked upon
a desolate shell...</i>

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,760
<i>with no whisper of the past
about its staring walls.</i>

25
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,480
<i>We can never
go back to Manderley again.</i>

26
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,365
<i>That much is certain.</i>

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,845
<i>But sometimes in my dreams...</i>

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,380
<i>I do go back to the strange
days of my life...</i>

29
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:23,880
<i>which began for me
in the South of France.</i>

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,485
<i>No! Stop!</i>

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,120
What the devil
are you shouting about?

32
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:06,685
Who are you?
What are you staring at?

33
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.
But I, I only thought-

34
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,880
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?

35
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,765
I was only walking.

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,280
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.

37
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,240
I'll never come to Monte Carlo
out of season again.

38
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,200
Not a single well-known
personality in the hotel.

39
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:52,720
<i>Stone cold! Waiter.
Garcon. Call him.</i>

40
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,565
Tell him to get me some-

41
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,920
<i>Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?</i>

42
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,000
- How do you do?
- I'm Edith Van Hopper.

43
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,045
It's so nice
to run into you here,

44
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,400
just when I was beginning to despair of
fiinding any old friends here in Monte.

45
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,685
But do sit down
and have some coffee.

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Mr. de Winter is having coffee with me.
Ask that stupid waiter for another cup.

47
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.

48
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,920
<i>- Garcon. Coffee, please.
- Oui, monsieur.</i>

49
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,765
- A cigarette?
- No, thank you.

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,445
You know, I recognized you
just as soon as you came in,

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,045
though I haven't seen you since
that night at the casino at Palm Beach.

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like
me. Are you playing the tables much here?

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
No, I'm afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago.

54
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:41,245
I can well understand that.
As for me,

55
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,365
if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.

56
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>It's one of the biggest places in that part of
the country, and you can't beat it for beauty.</i>

57
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,720
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?

58
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, well,
I think it's rather artifiicial.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,365
She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter.
That's her trouble.

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Most girls would give their eyes
for a chance to see Monte.

61
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,565
Wouldn't that rather
defeat the purpose?

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,920
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
<i>You must come and have a drink in my
suite. I hope they've given you a good room.</i>

64
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,120
<i>The place is empty. So if you're
uncomfortable, mind you, make a fuss.</i>

65
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,485
Your valet has unpacked for you,
I suppose?

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you'd like to do it for me?

67
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:21,885
Well, I, I hardly think-

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to
Mr. de Winter if he wants anything done.

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,600
You're a capable child in many ways.

70
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,600
That's a charming suggestion,
but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto:

71
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,877
" He travels fastest
who travels alone. "

72
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,120
Perhaps you've not heard of it.
Good night.

73
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:37,600
What do you make of that?

74
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>Do you suppose that sudden departure
was intended to be funny?</i>

75
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:43,497
Come, don't sit there gawking.
Let's go upstairs.

76
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,645
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,640
I remember when I was younger
there was a well-known writer...

78
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,485
who used to dart down the back
way whenever he saw me coming.

79
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,000
I suppose he was in love with me
and wasn't quite sure of himself.

80
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,365
<i>Well, c'est la vie.</i>

81
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,165
By the way, my dear,
don't think that I mean to be unkind,

82
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
but you were just a teeny, weeny bit
forward with Mr. de Winter.

83
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,285
Your effort to enter
the conversation...

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,565
quite embarrassed me,
and I'm sure it did him.

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come. Don't sulk.

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
After all, I am responsible
for your behavior here.

87
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,485
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing!

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,480
I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.

89
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,200
They say he simply adored her.

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,920
<i>Oui.
[ Speaking French ]</i>

91
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,685
Oh! How awkward of me.

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,565
<i>What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

93
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,885
<i>Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.</i>

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,565
Leave that. Leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,520
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.

96
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,165
- Why not?
- Oh, please don't be polite. It's very kind of you,

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,965
- but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
- I wasn't being polite.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,880
I should have asked you to have lunch with me
even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.

99
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,920
Come along. We needn't talk to
each other if we don't feel like it.

100
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,800
Thank you very much.

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh, I'll just ha-have
s- some scrambled eggs.

102
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,200
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
What's happened to your friend?

104
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,485
Oh, she's ill in bed with a cold.

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,565
I'm sorry
I was so rude to you yesterday.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,200
The only excuse I can offer is that I've
become boorish through living alone.

107
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,765
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone, and-

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,360
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation?

109
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,920
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as a paid companion.

110
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,965
I didn't know companionship
could be bought.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I looked up the word "companion"
in the dictionary once.

112
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,080
It said,
"a friend of the bosom. "

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,285
[ Chuckles ]
I don't envy you the privilege.

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,565
Oh, she's very kind, really,
and I have to earn my living.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,280
- Haven't you any family?
- No, my mother died years and years ago,

116
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,965
and then there was only my father.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,520
And he died last summer,
and then I took this job.

118
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,237
- How rotten for you.
- Yes, it was rather,

119
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,920
because, you see,
we got on so well together.

120
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,765
You and your father?

121
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Yes. He was a lovely person-
very unusual.

122
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,685
- What was he?
- A painter.

123
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,080
- Ah. Was he a good one?
- Well, I thought so.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
But people didn't understand him.

125
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,645
Yes, that's often the trouble.

126
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,045
He painted trees.
At least it was one tree.

127
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,885
You mean he painted the same
tree over and over again?

128
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,200
Yes. You see, he had a theory that
if you should fiind one perfect thing...

129
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,520
or place or person,
you should stick to it.

130
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,365
Do you think that's very silly?

131
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,765
Not at all.
I'm a fiirm believer in that myself.

132
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,940
And what did you fiind to do with
yourself while he was painting his tree?

133
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:42,080
Oh, I sat with him and I sketched
a little. I don't do it well, though.

134
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,480
- You're going sketching this afternoon?
- Yes.

135
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,365
- Where?
- I haven't made up my mind.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
- I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
- Oh, no, please. I didn't mean-

137
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,257
Oh, nonsense.
Finish up that mess and we'll get along.

138
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,080
Thank you. It's very kind of you,
but I'm not very hungry.

139
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:58,080
Oh, come on.
Eat it up like a good girl.

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,200
You're taking long enough for that sketch.
I expect a really fiine work of art.

141
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,680
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.

142
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,565
But it can't be
as bad as all that.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
Now, don't rub it all out.
Let me look at it fiirst.

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
- It's the perspective. I never can get it right.
- Let me see.

145
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,365
Oh, dear.

Yes. I went there once
with my father on holiday.

right by the sea.

the old lady said, "That's Manderley. "

<i>Oh, I see.
And you didn't come until after that?</i>

441
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,960
I came here when
the fiirst Mrs. de Winter was a bride.

442
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,005
Mrs. Danvers,
I do hope we'll be friends.

443
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,640
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me,

444
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:20,920
and I do want to make
a success of it...

445
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:23,005
and make Mr. de Winter happy.

446
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,805
So I know I can leave all
the household arrangements to you.

447
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,160
Very well. I hope I shall do everything
to your satisfaction, madam.

448
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:31,560
I've managed the house since
Mrs. de Winter's death,

449
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:34,360
and Mr. de Winter
has never complained.

450
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,840
I think I'll go downstairs now.

451
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,760
That room in the west wing I was telling
you about is there through that door.

452
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:22,885
It's not used now.

453
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,285
It's the most beautiful
room in the house-

454
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,160
the only one that looks down
across the lawns to the sea.

455
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,840
It was Mrs. de Winter's room.

456
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,820
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

457

You're Mrs. de Winter, aren't you?

458
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,480
- Yes.
- My name's Crawley.

459

I- I manage the estate for Maxim.

460
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:00,045
Awfully glad to meet you.

Yes, I'm sure there must have been.

463
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,765
I, I do wish I could help
with some of it.

464
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,325
Oh, no. Frank never allows
anybody to help him.

465
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,045
He's like an old mother hen
with his bills and rents and taxes.

466
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,880
- Come on, Frank. We must go over these estimates.
- I'll get my papers.

467
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:19,165
You'll fiind quantities
of breakfast over there.

468
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,280
- You must eat it all, or cook will be mortally offended.
- I'll do my best, Maxim.

469
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:25,360
I have to go over the place with Frank
to make sure he hasn't lost any of it.

470
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:27,600
- But you'll be all right, won't you?
- Mm-hmm.

- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Maxim.

Isn't there anything

Oh, no, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.

Thank you.

- Yes, madam. Manderley is a big place.

491
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:12,045
This was the banquet hall
in the old days.

492
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,480
It's still used on great occasions,
such as a big dinner or a ball,

493
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:19,280
and the public is admitted here,

That's nice.

[ Chuckles ] Oh, no.
Uh, which way is the morning room?

Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.

Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?

Mr. de Winter informed me
that his sister Mrs. Lacy...

and Major Lacy
are expected for luncheon.

I'd like to know
if you approve of the menu.

Oh, well, I-I'm sure
it's very suitable, very nice indeed.

You'll notice, madam, that
I've left a blank space for the sauce.

519

Mrs. de Winter was most
particular about sauces.

But I wonder Maxim
hasn't been at you.

588
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,760
He's so particular about clothes.

589
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,045
I don't think he ever notices
what I wear.

Oh, well, he must have changed
a lot, then. [ Chuckles ]

You mustn't worry
about old Maxim and his moods.

00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,180
One never knows what goes on
in that quiet mind of his.

593
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:42,045
Often he gets
into a terrible rage, and when he does-

[ Whistles ] But I don't suppose
he'll lose his temper with you.

Thank you very much.

And I must congratulate you
on the way Maxim looks.

603
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:07,480
We were very worried about him
this time last year.

Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.

Looks as though we might have a shower,
but you won't mind that, will you?

610
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,320
- No, but I'll go get a coat.
- There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room.

- Oh, I liked her very much.

But she kept saying that I was quite
different from what she expected.

What the devil did she expect?

615

Oh, someone smarter and more
sophisticated, I'm afraid.

616

Do you like my hair?

What's the matter with it?

- Oh, let's go down there.

Oh, no, it's a perfectly dull, uninteresting

Why isn't something
done about it?

Well, I think if Maxim wanted anything
done about it, he'd tell me.

Are those all

Yes. Yes, they are.

00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,485
What did she use the cottage for?

699
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,920
The boat used to be moored near there.

700
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,085
What boat? What happened to it?

701
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,320
Was that the boat she was sailing
in when she was drowned?

702
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,720
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.

703
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,800
Wasn't she afraid
to go out like that alone?

704
00:50:59,835 --> 00:51:02,200
She wasn't afraid of anything.

Where did they fiind her?

706
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,040
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles
up channel, about two months afterwards.

707
00:51:14,075 --> 00:51:18,600
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.

708
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:20,840
Yes, it must have been.

709
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,485
Mr. Crawley, please don't
think me morbidly curious.

710
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,400
It isn't that. It's just
that I feel at such a disadvantage.

711
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,320
All the time,
whenever I meet anyone,

712
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,365
Maxim's sister
or even the servants,

713
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,005
I know they're all
thinking the same thing.

714
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,600
They're all comparing me
with her, with Rebecca.

715
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:42,485
Oh, you mustn't think that.

716
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,120
I can't tell you how glad I am
that you've married Maxim.

It's going to make
all the difference to his life.

718
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:50,005
And from my point of view,
it's very refreshing...

719
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,920
to fiind someone like yourself
who's not entirely in tune,

720
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:55,205
shall we say, with Manderley.

721
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,085
That's very sweet of you.
I dare say I've been stupid,

722
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,200
but every day I realize
things that she had and that I lack:

723
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:07,485
beauty and wit and intelligence...

724
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,320
and, oh, all the things that
are so important in a woman.

725
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:13,520
But you have qualities
that are just as important-

726
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:15,720
more important, if I may say so.

727
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:18,005
Kindliness and sincerity...

728
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,085
and, if you'll forgive me, modesty...

729
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,600
mean more to a husband than
all the wit and beauty in the world.

730

We none of us want to live
in the past. Maxim least of all.

to lead us away from it.

Well, I promise you
I won't bring this up again,

733
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,597
but before we end
this conversation...

734
00:52:39,632 --> 00:52:42,285
would you answer
just one more question?

735
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,240
If it's something
I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.

736
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:51,000
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?

I suppose-

738
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,440
I suppose she was the most
beautiful creature I ever saw.

739
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,285
- Good evening, Maxim.
- Hello.

740
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,040
The fiilms of the honeymoon
have arrived at last.

741
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:44,440
Have we time, do you think,
before dinner?

742
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,285
Well, what on earth
have you done to yourself?

743
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,640
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress
from London. I hope you don't mind.

744
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:57,257
<i>Oh, no. Only do you think that
sort of thing is right for you?</i>

745
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:00,840
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.

746
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,800
And what have you done to your hair?

747
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:05,920
[ Laughing ]
Oh, I see.

748
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,320
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

749
00:54:08,355 --> 00:54:10,285
You look lovely, lovely.

750
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,240
That's very nice... for a change.

751
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,920
Shall we see these pictures?

752
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,320
Yes, I'd love to see them.

753
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,685
Ah, look, now. Look at that.

754
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,040
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?
Can't we go back there someday?

755
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:34,685
<i>Yes, of course, of course.
Ah, look at you. There.</i>

- Oh, remember that?

761
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,720
- Yes.
- Oh, I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.

762
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:54,565
Oh, dash it! Look.
Oh. Oh. Oh, hang it.

763
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,800
I've threaded it up wrong,
as usual, or something.

764
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,485
Yes, Frith, what is it?

765
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,400
Excuse me, sir.
May I have a word with you?

766
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:08,120
Yes. Come in.

767
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,085
It's about Robert, sir.

768
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,320
There's been a slight unpleasantness
between him and Mrs. Danvers.

769
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,320
- Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.

770
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,605
This is trouble. What is it?

771
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,765
It appears Mrs. Danvers
has accused Robert...

772
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,660
of stealing a valuable ornament
from the morning room.

773
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,365
<i>Robert denies the accusation
most emphatically, sir.</i>

774
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,405
<i>- What was the thing, anyway?
- The china cupid, sir.</i>

775
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,285
<i>[ Maxim ] Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?</i>

776
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,520
<i>Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom
of it somehow and I'm sure it wasn't Robert.</i>

777
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,405
<i>[ Rrith ]
Very good, sir.</i>

778
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,720
Why do they come to me with these
things? That's your job, sweetheart.

779
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:42,720
Maxim, I wanted to tell you,
but, um, well, I forgot.

780
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,405
- The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
- You broke it?

781
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,640
Now, why on earth didn't you say
something about it when Frith was here?

782
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:53,497
I don't know.
I didn't like to.

783
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:55,320
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.

784
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,600
Well, he'll think you
much more a fool now.

785
00:55:57,635 --> 00:55:59,765
You'll have to explain to him
and Mrs. Danvers.

786
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,600
- No, you do it. I'll go upstairs.
- Don't be such a little idiot.

787
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:05,320
Anybody would think
you were afraid of them.

788
00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:07,120
<i>It was all a mistake,
Mrs. Danvers.</i>

789
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,120
<i>Apparently, Mrs. de Winter
broke the cupid herself...</i>

790
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:11,000
<i>and forgot to say anything about it.</i>

791
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,920
I'm so sorry. I- I never thought
that I'd get Robert into trouble.

792
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,285
Is it possible to repair
the ornament, madam?

793
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,720
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It was smashed into pieces.

794
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:23,000
What did you do with the pieces?

795
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,920
Well, I-I put them at the back of one
of the drawers in the writing desk.

796
00:56:28,955 --> 00:56:31,365
Well, it looks as though
Mrs. de Winter were afraid...

797
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,765
<i>you were going to put her in prison,
doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?</i>

798
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Find the pieces, see if they can be
mended and tell Robert to dry his tears.

799
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:40,120
<i>I shall apologize
to Robert, of course.</i>

800
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,640
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,
Mrs. de Winter will tell me personally-

801
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:46,120
Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.

805
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,005
Mrs. Danvers
must be furious with me.

<i>Oh, hang Mrs. Danvers. Why on earth
should you be frightened of her?</i>

of the house at all.

Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.

810
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,405
I, I try my best every day,
but it's very diffiicult...

down as if I were a prize cow.

Well, what does it matter
if they do?

813
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,165
You must remember
that life at Manderley...

is the only thing that
interests anybody down here.

What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.

816
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,365
I suppose that's
why you married me.

817
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,320
Because you knew I was dull
and gauche and inexperienced...

818
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:39,720
and there could never be
any gossip about me.

Gossip?
What do you mean?

820
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,000
I- I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.

<i>Don't look at me like that.</i>

Maxim, what's the matter?
What have I said?

823
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,440
It wasn't a very attractive
thing to say, was it?

824
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:03,520
No. It was rude, hateful.

825
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,000
I wonder if I did a very selfiish
thing in marrying you.

You don't get much fun, do you?

You ought to have married a boy,
someone of your own age.

Of course we're companions.

No, you're not diffiicult.
You're easy, very easy.

01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,120
The mistress of the house
was hiding behind the door.

876
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,080
Oh, what about presenting me
to the bride?

877
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:45,720
- This is Mr. Favell, madam.
- How do you do?

878
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,920
How do you do?

879
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,720
Won't you have
some tea or something?

880
01:02:52,755 --> 01:02:54,885
Now, isn't that
a charming invitation?

881
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,405
I've been asked to stay to tea, Danny,
and I've a good mind to accept.

882
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,600
Oh, well, perhaps you're right. Pity,
just when we were getting on so nicely.

883
01:03:02,635 --> 01:03:05,800
We mustn't lead the young bride
astray, must we,Jasper?

884
01:03:05,835 --> 01:03:08,965
Good-bye.
It's been fun meeting you.

885
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,085
Oh, and by the way, it would be
very decent of you...

886
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,240
if you wouldn't mention this little
visit to your revered husband.

887
01:03:15,275 --> 01:03:18,005
<i>He doesn't exactly
approve of me.</i>

888
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,205
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.

889
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,120
I wish I had a young bride of three
months waiting for me at home.

890
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:27,877
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.

891
01:03:27,912 --> 01:03:30,565
Fare thee well.
[ Grunts ]

892
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,485
Oh, and I know what was wrong
with that introduction.

893
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,800
<i>Danny didn't tell you, did she?
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.</i>

<i>[ Window Slams ]</i>

896
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,960
<i>Do you wish anything, madam?</i>

897
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,005
I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.

898
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,880
I noticed a window wasn't closed, and
I came up to see if I could fasten it.

899
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:52,480
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.

900
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,645
You opened it yourself,
didn't you?

901
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,960
You've always wanted to see
this room, haven't you, madam?

902
01:05:58,995 --> 01:06:01,677
Why did you never ask me
to show it to you?

903
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:04,360
I was ready to show it to you
every day.

904
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,445
It's a lovely room, isn't it?

905
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,005
The loveliest room
you've ever seen.

906
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,240
Everything is kept
just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.

907
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:19,440
<i>Nothing has been altered
since that last night.</i>

908
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,960
Come. I'll show you
her dressing room.

909
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,160
This is where I keep
all her clothes.

910
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,480
You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?

911
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Feel this.

912
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,480
It was a Christmas present
from Mr. de Winter.

913
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,880
He was always giving her expensive
gifts, the whole year round.

914
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,680
<i>I keep her underwear
on this side.</i>

915
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,680
They were made specially for her by
the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.

916
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,125
I always used to wait up
for her, no matter how late.

917
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,360
Sometimes she and Mr. de Winter
didn't come home until dawn.

918
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,360
While she was undressing, she'd tell me
about the party she'd been to.

919
01:07:19,395 --> 01:07:23,440
She knew everyone that mattered,
and everyone loved her.

920
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,805
When she'd fiinished her bath,

921
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,440
she'd go into the bedroom and
go over to the dressing table.

922
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,405
Oh, you've moved
her brush, haven't you?

923
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,640
There, that's better-
just as she always laid it down.

924
01:07:46,675 --> 01:07:49,325
"Come on, Danny,
hair drill," she would say.

925
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,240
I'd stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

926
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:56,640
And then she would say,

927
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,160
"Good night, Danny,"
and step into her bed.

928
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,560
<i>I embroidered this case
for her myself,</i>

929
01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:12,880
<i>and I keep it here always.</i>

930
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,280
Did you ever see
anything so delicate?

931
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,360
Look, you can see
my hand through it.

932
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,680
<i>You wouldn't think she'd
been gone so long, would you?</i>

933
01:09:03,715 --> 01:09:06,560
Sometimes when I walk
along the corridor,

934
01:09:06,595 --> 01:09:09,005
I fancy I hear her
just behind me.

935
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,005
That quick, light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

936
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,880
It's not only in this room.
It's in all the rooms in the house.

937
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:20,080
I can almost hear it now.

938
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,760
Do you think the dead
come back and watch the living?

939
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:27,440
[ Sobbing ]
No, I don't believe it.

940
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,360
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't
come back here to Manderley...

941
01:09:32,395 --> 01:09:35,360
and watch you
and Mr. de Winter together.

942
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,560
You look tired. Why don't you
stay here a while and rest...

943
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,040
and listen to the sea?

944
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,960
It's so soothing.

945
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,440
Listen to it.

946
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,680
Listen.

947
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,760
Listen to the sea.

948
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,240
Tell Mrs. Danvers
I wish to see her immediately.

949
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,560
You sent for me, madam?

950
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:02,725
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.

951
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,040
I want you to get rid
of all these things.

952

These are Mrs. de Winter's things.

953
01:11:07,075 --> 01:11:10,205
I am Mrs. de Winter now.

954
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,280
Very well.
I'll give the instructions.

Just a moment, please.

957
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,440
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to
Mr. de Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.

958
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:30,960
In fact, I'd prefer to forget everything
that happened this afternoon.

959
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,800
Oh, Maxim, Maxim,
you've been gone all day!

960
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:44,525
You're choking me.
Well. Well, well, well.

- Oh, I've been thinking.

- What did you want to do that for?
- Come in here and I'll tell you.

963
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,760
Darling, could we have
a costume ball...

964
01:11:54,795 --> 01:11:57,525
just as you used to?

965
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,080
Now, what put that
into your mind?

966
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,925
Has Beatrice been at you?

967
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,525
No, no, but I feel that
we ought to do something...

968
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,160
to make people feel that Manderley
is just the same as it always was.

969
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,360
Oh, please, darling, could we?

970
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,845
You don't know
what it would mean, you know.

971
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,605
You would have to be hostess
to hundreds of people, all the county.

972
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,360
And a lot of young people would come up from
London and turn the house into a night club.

973
01:12:24,395 --> 01:12:26,405
Oh, yes, but I want to.
Oh, please.

974
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,360
I've never been to a large party,
but I could learn what to do.

975
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:32,240
And I promise you,
you wouldn't be ashamed of me.

976
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,845
All right,
if you think you'd enjoy it.

977
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,240
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers
to help you, hadn't you?

978
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,660
No, no. I don't need
Mrs. Danvers to help me.

- I can do it myself.
- All right, my sweet.

- Oh, what'll you go as?
- Oh, I never dress up.

982
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:57,525
That's the one privilege
I claim as the host.

983
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,440
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland
with that ribbon around your hair?

984
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,325
I won't tell.
I'll design my costume...

Robert found these sketches
in the library, madam.

989
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,325
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.

990
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,360
They were just some ideas I was
sketching for my costume for the ball.

991
01:13:34,395 --> 01:13:36,325
Hasn't Mr. de Winter
suggested anything?

992
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,160
No, I want to surprise him. I don't
want him to know anything about it.

993
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:41,717
I merely thought that
you might fiind a costume...

994
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:44,205
among the family portraits
that would suit you.

995
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,760
Oh, you mean those at the top of
the stairs? I'll go and look at them.

996
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,760
This one, for instance.
It might have been designed for you.

997
01:13:58,795 --> 01:14:00,925
I'm sure you could have it copied.

998
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,960
I've heard Mr. de Winter say that this
is his favorite of all the paintings.

999
01:14:04,995 --> 01:14:07,845
It's Lady Caroline de Winter,
one of his ancestors.

1000
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,560
Oh, well, well, that's a splendid idea,
Mrs. Danvers. I'm-I'm very grateful.

- Yes, sir. Thank you.

Excuse me, sir.
Are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?

1003
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:47,125
Oh, no, this is just
my old cap and gown.

1004
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,880
Certainly makes a very nice costume,
sir, and economical too.

1005
01:14:50,915 --> 01:14:53,880
Yes. That was the idea.

1006
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,920
Evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.

Where's the child?

1171
01:27:01,395 --> 01:27:05,000
How could I even ask you to love me
when I knew you loved Rebecca still?

1172
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,920
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

1173
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,645
Whenever you touched me, I knew
you were comparing me with Rebecca.

1174
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,320
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me
or walked with me in the garden,

1175
01:27:21,355 --> 01:27:23,165
I knew you were thinking,

1176
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,400
"This I did with Rebecca,
and this and this. "

1177
01:27:26,435 --> 01:27:28,245
Oh, it's true, isn't it?

1178
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,880
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?

1179
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,280
I hated her.

1180
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,400
Oh, I was carried away by her,

1181
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:52,885
enchanted by her, as everyone was.

1182
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,480
And when I was married, I was told
I was the luckiest man in the world.

1183
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,565
She was so lovely,

1184
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,685
so accomplished, so amusing.

1185
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:10,000
"She's got the three things that really
matter in a wife," everyone said.

1186
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,757
" Breeding, brains and beauty. "

1187
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:15,480
And I believed them, completely.

1188
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,880
But I never had
a moment's happiness with her.

1189
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:22,957
She was incapable of love...

1190
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:26,000
or tenderness or decency.

1191
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,245
You didn't love her?
You didn't love her?

1192
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:34,800
Do you remember that cliff
where you fiirst saw me in Monte Carlo?

1193
01:28:34,835 --> 01:28:38,120
Well, I went there with Rebecca
on our honeymoon.

1194
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,800
That was where
I found out about her.

1195
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:43,600
Four days
after we were married.

1196
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,120
She stood there laughing,

1197
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,600
her black hair
blowing in the wind,

1198
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,600
and told me all about herself.

1199
01:28:51,635 --> 01:28:53,480
Everything.

1200
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,600
Things I'll never tell a living soul.

1201
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,400
I wanted to kill her.

1202
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,400
It would have been so easy.
Remember the precipice?

1203
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:09,600
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.

1204
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:12,920
Perhaps I was.
Perhaps I am mad.

1205
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,480
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it,
living with the devil?

1206
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,045
"I'll make a bargain with you,"
she said.

1207
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,640
"You'd look rather foolish trying to
divorce me now after four days of marriage,

1208
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:30,200
"so I'll play the part of a devoted
wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.

1209
01:29:30,235 --> 01:29:33,200
"I'll make it the most famous
showplace in England, if you like,

1210
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:35,365
"and people will visit us
and envy us...

1211
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,280
"and say we're the luckiest,
happiest couple in the country.

1212
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,080
What a grand joke it will be!
What a triumph!"

1213
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:51,600
I should never have accepted
her dirty bargain, but I did.

1214
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,200
I was younger then and tremendously
conscious of the family honor.

1215
01:29:57,235 --> 01:30:00,365
[ Scoffs ]
Family honor.

1216
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,340
She knew that
I'd sacrifiice everything...

1217
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,245
rather than stand up
in a divorce court...

1218
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:07,600
and give her away, admit that
our marriage was a rotten fraud.

1219
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,285
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.

1220
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:18,400
You can't understand what
my feelings were, can you?

1221
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,680
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.

1222
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,280
Well, I kept the bargain.
And so did she, apparently.

1223
01:30:28,315 --> 01:30:30,645
Oh, she played the game brilliantly.

1224
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,565
But after a while,
she began to grow careless.

1225
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,000
She took a flat in London,
and she'd stay away for days at a time.

1226
01:30:37,035 --> 01:30:39,417
Then she started to bring
her friends down here.

1227
01:30:39,452 --> 01:30:41,786
I warned her,
but she shrugged her shoulders.

1228
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:44,085
"What's it got to do with you?"
she said.

1229
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,360
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.

1230
01:30:48,395 --> 01:30:52,197
Then there was a cousin of hers,
a man named Favell.

1231
01:30:52,232 --> 01:30:56,000
Yes, I know him.
He came the day you went to London.

1232
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:58,365
Why didn't you tell me?

1233
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,720
I didn't like to. I thought
it would remind you of Rebecca.

1234
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:06,877
Remind me!
[ Chuckles ]

1235
01:31:06,912 --> 01:31:09,845
As if I needed reminding.

1236
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,000
Favell used to visit her
here in this cottage.

1237
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:15,565
I found out about it,
and I warned her...

1238
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,485
that if he came here again,
I'd shoot them both.

1239
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,800
One night when I found that
she'd come back quietly from London,

1240
01:31:22,835 --> 01:31:24,645
<i>I thought that Ravell
was with her,</i>

1241
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:29,480
and I knew then I couldn't stand this
life of fiilth and deceit any longer.

1242
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,920
I decided to come down here and
have it out with both of them.

1243
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,565
But she was alone.

1244
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,480
She was expecting Favell,
but he hadn't come.

1245
01:31:41,515 --> 01:31:43,685
<i>She was lying on the divan,</i>

1246
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,000
<i>a large tray of cigarette
stubs beside her.</i>

1247
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:49,617
<i>She looked ill, queer.</i>

1248
01:31:49,652 --> 01:31:52,165
<i>Suddenly she got up,</i>

1249
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,885
<i>started to walk toward me.</i>

1250
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,045
<i>"When I have a child,
she said,</i>

1251
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,165
<i>"neither you nor anyone else
could ever prove it wasn't yours.</i>

1252
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:04,600
<i>You'd like to have an heir, wouldn't
you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"</i>

1253
01:32:04,635 --> 01:32:06,365
<i>Then she started to laugh.</i>

1254
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,765
<i>"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.</i>

1255
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,000
<i>"I'd be the perfect mother,
just as I've been the perfect wife.</i>

1256
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:14,965
<i>"No one will ever know.</i>

1257
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,400
<i>"It ought to give you
the thrill of your life, Max,</i>

1258
01:32:17,435 --> 01:32:19,965
<i>"to watch my son grow bigger
day by day...</i>

1259
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,880
<i>and to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his. "</i>

1260
01:32:23,915 --> 01:32:27,000
<i>She was face to face with me,</i>

1261
01:32:27,035 --> 01:32:29,365
one hand in her pocket,

1262
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,200
the other holding a cigarette.

1263
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:34,365
She was smiling.

1264
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,200
"Well, Max,
what are you going to do about it?

1265
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,400
Aren't you going to kill me?"

1266
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,280
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1267
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,200
I must have struck her.

1268
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,165
She stood staring at me.

1269
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,200
She looked almost triumphant.

1270
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,800
Then she started
toward me again, smiling.

1271
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:07,320
Suddenly she stumbled and fell.

1272
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,080
When I looked down- ages afterwards,
it seemed- she was lying on the floor.

1273
01:33:17,115 --> 01:33:21,720
She'd struck her head on a heavy
piece of ship's tackle.

1274
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,480
I remember wondering
why she was still smiling...

1275
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:29,565
then I realized she was dead.

1276
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,680
But you didn't kill her!
It was an accident!

1277
01:33:32,715 --> 01:33:36,965
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.

1278
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,600
I just knew I had to do something,
anything.

1279
01:33:40,635 --> 01:33:43,565
I carried her out to the boat.

1280
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,480
It was very dark.
There was no moon.

1281
01:33:47,515 --> 01:33:49,765
I put her in the cabin.

1282
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,520
When the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore, I took a spike...

1283
01:33:52,555 --> 01:33:55,617
and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull.

1284
01:33:55,652 --> 01:33:58,680
I had opened up the seacocks,
and the water began to come in fast.

1285
01:33:58,715 --> 01:34:01,720
I climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away.

1286
01:34:01,755 --> 01:34:06,280
I saw the boat heel over... and sink.

1287
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,800
I pulled back into the cove.

1288
01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:14,365
It started raining.

1289
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,060
Maxim, does anyone else know this?

1290
01:34:17,095 --> 01:34:19,720
No, no one, except you and me.

1291
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,885
We must explain it.

1292
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,120
It's got to be the body
of someone you've never seen before.

1293
01:34:26,155 --> 01:34:28,000
No, they're bound to know her.

1294
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,965
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.

1295
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,720
They'll identify her body,
then they'll remember the other woman,

1296
01:34:35,755 --> 01:34:38,377
the other woman
buried in the crypt.

1297
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:40,965
If they fiind out it was Rebecca,

1298
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,165
you must simply say that you made
a mistake about the other body-

1299
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,080
that the day you went to Edgecombe, you were
ill, you didn't know what you were doing.

1300
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:49,320
Rebecca's dead.
That's what we've got to remember.

1301
01:34:49,355 --> 01:34:51,285
Rebecca's dead.
She can't speak.

1302
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,445
She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.

1303
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,740
We're the only two people in the world
that know, Maxim-you and I.

1304
01:34:56,775 --> 01:35:00,000
I told you once that I'd done
a very selfiish thing in marrying you.

1305
01:35:00,035 --> 01:35:02,840
You can understand now
what I meant.

1306
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:05,357
I've loved you, my darling.

1307
01:35:05,392 --> 01:35:07,805
I shall always love you.

1308
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,720
But I've known all along that
Rebecca would win in the end.

1309
01:35:12,755 --> 01:35:14,925
No, no, she hasn't won.

1310
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,320
No matter what happens now,
she hasn't won.

ColonelJulyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.

1320
01:36:03,955 --> 01:36:07,205
He's been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary.

1321
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,240
He wants to know if I could
possibly have made a mistake...

1322
01:36:11,275 --> 01:36:13,440
about that other body.

1323
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,720
Well, ColonelJulyan, apparently I did
make a mistake about that other body.

1324
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:39,405
The mistake was quite natural
under the circumstances.

1325
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,720
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- I was perfectly well.

1326
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:44,805
Well, don't let it worry you, Maxim.

1327
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,440
Nobody can blame you
for making a mistake.

1328
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,085
The pity is, you've got to go through
the same thing all over again.

1329
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,160
- What do you mean?
- Oh, there'll have to be another inquest, of course.

1330
01:36:54,195 --> 01:36:56,925
- The same formality and red tape.
- Oh.

1331
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,160
I wish you could be spared the publicity
of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1332
01:37:00,195 --> 01:37:02,405
Oh, yes, the publicity.

1333
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,380
I suppose Mrs. de Winter
went below for something...

1334
01:37:05,415 --> 01:37:08,285
and a squall hit the boat
with nobody at the helm.

1335
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,520
I imagine that's about the solution
of it, don't you think so, Crawley?

1336
01:37:11,555 --> 01:37:14,720
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed
and she couldn't get on deck again.

1337
01:37:14,755 --> 01:37:16,605
Yes. Tabb, the boatbuilder,

1338
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,040
will undoubtedly come
to some such conclusion.

1339
01:37:19,075 --> 01:37:21,257
Why? What would he know about it?

1340
01:37:21,292 --> 01:37:23,440
Well, he's examining the boat now.

1341
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,485
Purely as a matter of routine,
you know.

1342
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,360
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim-
quite unoffiicially, you know.

We must get together for a game of golf
when it's all over, eh?

- Yes.
- Bye-bye.

1345

I have the evening papers, madam.

1346
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,560
- Would you care to see them?
- Oh, no thank you, Frith,

1347
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,205
and I'd prefer that Mr. de Winter
weren't troubled with them either.

1348
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,740
I understand, madam. Permit me to say
that we're all most distressed outside.

1349
01:37:56,775 --> 01:38:00,240
- Oh, thank you, Frith.
- I'm afraid the news has been a shock to Mrs. Danvers.

1350
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:02,605
Yes, I rather expected it would be.

1351
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,360
It seems there's to be
a coroner's inquest, madam?

1352
01:38:05,395 --> 01:38:07,917
Yes, Frith.
It's purely a formality.

1353
01:38:07,952 --> 01:38:10,405
Of course, madam.
I, I wanted to say...

1354
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,205
that if any of us might be
required to give evidence,

1355
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,780
I should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family.

1356
01:38:16,815 --> 01:38:20,320
Oh, thank you, Frith. I'm sure Mr.
de Winter will be very happy to hear it.

1357
01:38:20,355 --> 01:38:23,240
But I don't think
anything will be necessary.

and a sudden gust of wind
came down,

the boat, wouldn't it?

Excuse me, sir, but there's
a little more to it than that.

are the valves to drain out the boat,</i>

- Just this.

1463
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,640
<i>should have wanted
to end her own life?</i>

1464
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,605
I know of no reason whatever.

1465
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,805
Mr. de Winter,
however painful it may be,

1466
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,005
<i>I have to ask you
a very personal question.</i>

1467
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:28,040
<i>Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?</i>

1468
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:33,360
Were relations between you and the late
Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?

1469
01:44:33,395 --> 01:44:36,160
I won't stand this any longer!
And you might as well know now-

1470
01:44:36,195 --> 01:44:38,405
<i>- [ Gasps, Murmuring ]
- [ Gavel Pounding ]</i>

1471
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,580
<i>We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. de Winter,</i>

1472
01:44:40,615 --> 01:44:43,327
<i>I presume you'll
be available for us then?</i>

1473
01:44:43,362 --> 01:44:46,161
I told you you should
have had some breakfast.

1474
01:44:46,196 --> 01:44:48,960
You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.

1475
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,720
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have
some lunch from the house and sent me with it.

1476
01:44:56,755 --> 01:45:00,440
- Oh, that's fiine, Mullen. Can you pull around the corner?
- Very good, sir.

1477
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,005
Awfully foolish of me
fainting like that.

1478
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,840
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted,
I'd have really lost my temper.

1479
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,760
Darling, please be careful.

1480
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,605
Darling, wait here a few moments.

1481
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,205
- I'll see if I can fiind old Frank.
- Of course, darling.

1482
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:30,160
- Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
- Sure? All right.

1483
01:45:30,195 --> 01:45:33,920
Here, have a spot of this.
Do you good.

1484
01:45:33,955 --> 01:45:35,760
Thank you.

1485
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,440
- Sure you're all right?
- Yes, of course.

1486
01:45:40,475 --> 01:45:42,640
- I won't be long.
- Right you are.

1487
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,485
<i>- Ugh.
- Hello.</i>

1488
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,960
And how does the bride
fiind herself today?

1489
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,840
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly
a bed of roses, is it?

1490
01:45:56,875 --> 01:45:59,457
I think you'd better go
before Maxim gets back.

1491
01:45:59,492 --> 01:46:02,106
Oh,jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.

1492
01:46:02,141 --> 01:46:04,685
But you don't think
I'm the Big Bad Wolf, do you?

1493
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,760
I'm not, you know. I'm
a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.

1494
01:46:07,795 --> 01:46:10,560
And I think you're behaving
splendidly over all this.

1495
01:46:10,595 --> 01:46:12,405
Perfectly splendidly.

1496
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,960
You know, you've grown up a bit
since I last saw you.

1497
01:46:14,995 --> 01:46:17,085
- It's no wonder.
- What do you want, Favell?

1498
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,685
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going
pretty well for you, aren't they?

1499
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:24,040
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at fiirst.

1500
01:46:24,075 --> 01:46:26,405
That's why I came down
to the inquest.

1501
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:30,040
I'm touched by your solicitude, but if you
don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.

1502
01:46:30,075 --> 01:46:33,840
Lunch! I say, what a jolly idea!
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?

1503
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:37,485
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?

1504
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,440
You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.

1505
01:46:41,475 --> 01:46:43,485
Talk what things over?

1506
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,280
Well, those holes in the planking,
for one thing.

1507
01:46:46,315 --> 01:46:49,040
Those holes that were drilled
from the inside.

1508
01:46:49,075 --> 01:46:51,405
<i>- Oh, Mullen!
- Yes, sir?</i>

1509
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:54,320
<i>Would you, like a good fellow,
have my car fiilled with petrol?</i>

1510
01:46:54,355 --> 01:46:56,205
- It's almost empty.
- Very good, sir.

1511
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:59,240
- And Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1512
01:46:59,275 --> 01:47:01,640
Does this bother you?

1513
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,405
You know, old boy,
I have a strong feeling...

1514
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,960
that before the day is out,
somebody's going to make use of that...

1515
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,640
rather expressive, though somewhat
old-fashioned term "foul play. "

1516
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,640
<i>Am I boring you with all this?</i>

1517
01:47:21,675 --> 01:47:25,040
No? Good.

1518
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:28,780
Well, you see, Max, I fiind myself
in a rather awkward position.

1519
01:47:28,815 --> 01:47:32,127
You've only got to read this note
to understand. It's from Rebecca.

1520
01:47:32,162 --> 01:47:35,440
<i>And what's more, she had the foresight
to put the date on it.</i>

1521
01:47:35,475 --> 01:47:38,285
She wrote it to me
the day she died.

1522
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,320
<i>Incidentally,
I was out on a party on that night,</i>

1523
01:47:40,355 --> 01:47:42,320
<i>so I didn't get it
until the next day.</i>

1524
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:44,320
What makes you think that
note would interest me?

1525
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,840
Oh, I'm not going to bother you
with the contents now,

1526
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:49,240
but I can assure you that
it is not the note of a woman...

1527
01:47:49,275 --> 01:47:52,240
who intends to drown herself
that same night.

1528
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,360
By the way,
what do you do with old bones?

1529
01:47:57,395 --> 01:47:59,805
Bury them, eh, what?

1530
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,925
However, for the time being-

1531
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,960
You know, Max, I'm getting awfully fed
up with my job as a motorcar salesman.

1532
01:48:06,995 --> 01:48:09,457
I don't know if you've ever
experienced the feeling...

1533
01:48:09,492 --> 01:48:11,920
of driving an expensive motorcar
which isn't your own.

1534
01:48:11,955 --> 01:48:13,805
<i>But it can be
very, very exasperating.</i>

1535
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:17,005
You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.

1536
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,160
I've often wondered what it would be
like to retire to the country,

1537
01:48:20,195 --> 01:48:22,457
have a nice little place
with a few acres of shooting.

1538
01:48:22,492 --> 01:48:24,720
I've never fiigured out
what it would cost a year,

1539
01:48:24,755 --> 01:48:26,605
but I'd like to talk about it with you.

1540
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:29,920
I'd like to have your advice on how
to live comfortably without hard work.

1541
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,605
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?

1542
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:39,840
Yes. Mr. Favell and I have a little
business transaction on hand.

1543
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:42,560
<i>I think we had better
conduct it over at the inn.</i>

1544
01:48:42,595 --> 01:48:46,640
They may have
a private room there.

1545
01:48:46,675 --> 01:48:49,085
Well, see you later.

1546
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:52,160
Find ColonelJulyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.

1547
01:48:52,195 --> 01:48:54,440
Come on, Favell. Let's go.

1548
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:57,640
[ Chattering ]

1549
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,205
Have you a private room, please?

1550
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,240
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.
- Thank you.

1551
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,805
Hope this will do, Mr. de Winter.

1552
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,605
Oh, it's splendid, splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.

1553
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,840
- Any orders, gents?
- Yes, you might bring me a large brandy and soda.

1554
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:17,857
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.

1555
01:49:17,892 --> 01:49:20,840
- Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
- Make it two, will you, my good fellow?

1556
01:49:20,875 --> 01:49:22,640
<i>- Very good, sir.
- [Julyan ] Where's Mr. de Winter?</i>

1557
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,320
<i>Oh, through the other door, sir.</i>

1558
01:49:25,355 --> 01:49:27,805
ColonelJulyan, his is Mr. Favell.

1559
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,685
Oh, I know ColonelJulyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?

1560
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,440
Since you're old friends, I assume you
also know he's head of the police here.

1561
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,760
I think he might be interested to hear your
proposition. Go on, tell him all about it.

1562
01:49:37,795 --> 01:49:40,640
I merely said I hoped to give up
selling cars and retire.

1563
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,720
Actually, he offered to withhold
a vital piece of evidence...

1564
01:49:42,755 --> 01:49:44,605
if I made it worth his while.

1565
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,240
I only want to see justice done,
Colonel.

1566
01:49:47,275 --> 01:49:49,085
Now, that boatbuilder's evidence...

1567
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,640
suggested certain theories
concerning Rebecca's death.

1568
01:49:51,675 --> 01:49:53,485
One of them, of course, is suicide.

1569
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:58,160
I have a little note here which puts
that possibility quite out of court.

1570
01:49:58,195 --> 01:50:00,605
<i>- Read it, Colonel.
- "Jack, darling,</i>

1571
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,005
"I've just seen the doctor and I'm going
down to Manderley right away.

1572
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:07,360
"I shall be at the cottage all evening
and shall leave the door open for you.

1573
01:50:07,395 --> 01:50:11,205
<i>I have something terribly
important to tell you. Rebecca. "</i>

1574
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:14,805
Now, does that look like the note of a woman
who had made up her mind to kill herself?

1575
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,160
And apart from that, Colonel, do you mean to
tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide,

1576
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:21,045
you'd go to all the trouble
of putting out to sea in a boat,

1577
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,280
then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously
knock holes through the bottom of it?

1578
01:50:24,315 --> 01:50:26,565
Come, Colonel,
as an offiicer of the law,

1579
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,800
don't you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion?

1580
01:50:29,835 --> 01:50:31,925
- Of murder?
- What else?

1581
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,240
You've known Max a long time, so
you know he's the old-fashioned type...

1582
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,480
<i>who'd die to defend his honor
or who'd kill for it.</i>

1583
01:50:38,515 --> 01:50:40,280
It's blackmail, pure and simple.

1584
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,845
Blackmail's not so pure nor so simple.

1585
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,525
It can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people,

1586
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:48,880
and the blackmailer sometimes fiinds
himself in jail at the end of it.

1587
01:50:48,915 --> 01:50:51,765
I see. You're going to hold
de Winter's hand through all this...

1588
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,560
just because he's the big noise around here and
he's actually permitted you to dine with him.

1589
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:57,880
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.

1590
01:50:57,915 --> 01:51:00,480
<i>- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.</i>

1591
01:51:00,515 --> 01:51:02,360
- Oh.
- It's that fellow Ben.

1592
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,565
If that stupid coroner
hadn't been a snob,

1593
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,680
- he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding
something. - And why should Ben do that?

1594
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,680
Because we caught him once, Rebecca and I,
peering at us through the cottage window.

1595
01:51:10,715 --> 01:51:13,280
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.

1596
01:51:13,315 --> 01:51:16,200
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.

1597
01:51:16,235 --> 01:51:18,845
It's ridiculous
even listening to all this.

1598
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,480
Ah. You're like a little trades union,
all of you, aren't you?

1599
01:51:21,515 --> 01:51:23,365
And if my guess is right, Crawley,

1600
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,680
<i>there's a bit of malice
in your soul toward me, isn't there?</i>

1601
01:51:26,715 --> 01:51:29,560
Crawley didn't have
much success with Rebecca,

1602
01:51:29,595 --> 01:51:32,565
but he ought to have
more luck this time.

1603
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,480
<i>The bride will be grateful
for your fraternal arm, Crawley...</i>

1604
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,445
<i>in a week or so.</i>

1605
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,400
<i>- Every time she faints, in fact.
- De Winter!</i>

1606
01:51:39,435 --> 01:51:41,365
- Maxim, please!
- De Winter!

1607
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:44,360
That temper of yours
will do you in yet, Max.

1608
01:51:44,395 --> 01:51:46,845
<i>[ Knock At Door ]</i>

1609
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,360
Oh, uh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Now, is there anything else?

1610
01:51:52,395 --> 01:51:55,525
Yes. You might bring
Mr. de Winter a sedative.

1611
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:58,200
- No, no, nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good, sir.

1612
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,965
Now, Favell,
let's get this business over.

1613
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,480
As you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully,

1614
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,880
perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive?

1615
01:52:07,915 --> 01:52:10,200
I knew you were going
to bring that up, Colonel.

1616
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,280
I've read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive.

1617
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:16,965
And if you'll all excuse me
for a moment, I'll supply that too.

1618
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,280
I wish you would go home. You ought
not to be here through all this.

1619
01:52:20,315 --> 01:52:22,165
Please let me stay, Maxim.

1620
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
<i>Surely, Colonel Julyan,you're
not going to allow this fellow-</i>

1621
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,080
My opinion of Favell
is no higher than yours, Crawley.

1622
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:28,965
But in my offiicial capacity,

1623
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,160
I have no alternative
but to pursue his accusation.

1624
01:52:31,195 --> 01:52:33,125
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.

1625
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,080
In a manner so serious as this,
we must make sure...

1626
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,925
of every point, explore every avenue,

1627
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,880
and, in fact, if I may coin a phrase,
leave no stone unturned.

1628
01:52:41,915 --> 01:52:44,480
Ah, here she is- the missing link,

1629
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:47,045
<i>the witness who will help
supply the motive.</i>

1630
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:50,245
<i>Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.</i>

1631
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:53,280
<i>- Won't you sit down?
- No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny.</i>

1632
01:52:53,315 --> 01:52:57,000
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?

1633
01:52:57,035 --> 01:53:00,017
Mrs. de Winter
always had Dr. McClean from the village.

1634
01:53:00,052 --> 01:53:03,000
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor, in London.

1635
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,165
I don't know anything about that.

1636
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,080
Oh, don't give me that.
You knew everything about Rebecca.

1637
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:11,445
You knew she was in love with me,
didn't you?

1638
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:15,160
<i>Surely you haven't forgotten the good times
she and I used to have down at the cottage.</i>

1639
01:53:15,195 --> 01:53:17,645
She had a right
to amuse herself, didn't she?

1640
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,565
Love was a game to her.
It made her laugh, I tell you.

1641
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,560
She used to sit on her bed and
rock with laughter at the lot of you.

1642
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:27,560
Can you think of any reason why Mrs. de
Winter should have taken her own life?

1643
01:53:27,595 --> 01:53:29,480
No, no, I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her,

1644
01:53:29,515 --> 01:53:31,400
and I won't believe it.

1645
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:34,245
There, you see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.

1646
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:37,160
Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that
Rebecca went to a doctor in London.

1647
01:53:37,195 --> 01:53:40,200
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

1648
01:53:40,235 --> 01:53:42,165
Oh, I understand, Danny.

1649
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,160
You think we're asking you
to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.

1650
01:53:45,195 --> 01:53:47,560
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.

1651
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:50,360
I'm trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide.

1652
01:53:50,395 --> 01:53:53,177
Mrs. Danvers,
it has been suggested...

1653
01:53:53,212 --> 01:53:55,706
Mrs. de Winter
was deliberately murdered.

1654
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:58,165
There you have it
in a nutshell, Danny.

1655
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:01,080
But there's one more thing you'll
want to know: the name of the murderer.

1656
01:54:01,115 --> 01:54:03,880
It's a lovely name that
rolls off the tongue so easily:

1657
01:54:03,915 --> 01:54:06,880
George Fortescue
Maximilian de Winter.

1658
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:15,880
There was a doctor. Mrs. de Winter
sometimes went to him privately.

1659
01:54:15,915 --> 01:54:18,565
She used to go to him
even before she was married.

1660
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,880
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?

1661
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,725
Dr. Baker, 165 Goldhawk Road,
Shepherd's Bush.

1662
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,620
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll fiind your motive.

1663
01:54:35,655 --> 01:54:38,480
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him-

1664
01:54:38,515 --> 01:54:40,760
<i>to confiirm the fact that
she was going to have a child,</i>

1665
01:54:40,795 --> 01:54:43,160
<i>a sweet, curly-headed
little child.</i>

1666
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,940
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.

1667
01:54:45,975 --> 01:54:48,565
She told Max about it.
Maxim knew he wasn't the father.

1668
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:51,480
So, like the gentleman of the old school
that he is, he killed her!

1669
01:54:51,515 --> 01:54:54,360
<i>[Julyan ] I'm afraid we shall have
to question this Dr. Baker.</i>

1670
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:58,280
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along too.

1671
01:54:58,315 --> 01:55:01,365
Yes, unfortunately, I suppose
you have the right to ask that.

1672
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:05,080
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest
postponed pending further evidence.

1673
01:55:05,115 --> 01:55:08,760
<i>I say, aren't you rather afraid that the
prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?</i>

1674
01:55:08,795 --> 01:55:11,800
You have my word for it
that he will not do that.

1675
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,760
Toodle-oo, Max.
Come along, Danny.

1676
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:18,680
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone.

1677
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,280
Are you sure you don't want me
to go with you, Maxim?

1678
01:55:31,315 --> 01:55:33,280
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.

1679
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:37,160
I'll be back the very fiirst thing in the
morning, and I won't even stop to sleep.

1680
01:55:37,195 --> 01:55:39,160
I'll be waiting for you.

1681
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,965
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.

1682
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,800
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.

1683
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,160
Dr. Baker, you may have seen Mr. de
Winter's name in the papers recently.

1684
01:56:07,195 --> 01:56:10,880
Oh, yes, yes. In connection
with a body that was found in a boat.

1685
01:56:10,915 --> 01:56:13,645
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case.

1686
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:16,080
- My condolences- - Oh, this
is going to take hours. Let me-

1687
01:56:16,115 --> 01:56:18,880
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.

1688
01:56:18,915 --> 01:56:21,125
We're trying to discover
certain facts...

1689
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:24,480
concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's
activities on the day of her death,

1690
01:56:24,515 --> 01:56:27,880
October 12, last year,
and I want you to tell me, if you can,

1691
01:56:27,915 --> 01:56:31,080
if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date.

1692
01:56:31,115 --> 01:56:34,080
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1693
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,640
I should have remembered
the name de Winter.

1694
01:56:36,675 --> 01:56:39,045
I've never attended
a Mrs. de Winter in my life.

1695
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:41,960
Well, how can you possibly tell
all your patients' names?

1696
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:45,160
I can look it up
in my engagement diary if you like.

1697
01:56:45,195 --> 01:56:49,037
<i>- Did you say the 12th of October?
- Yes.</i>

1698
01:56:49,072 --> 01:56:52,725
<i>Oh, here we are.
No, no de Winter.</i>

1699
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:56,600
- Are you sure?
- Well, here are all the appointments for that day.

1700
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:59,880
" Ross, Campbell, Steadall,
Perrino, Danvers, Mathews-"

1701
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:02,245
Danny! What the devil!

1702
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:05,680
Would you read that name again?
Did you say Danvers?

1703
01:57:05,715 --> 01:57:08,165
Yes, I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.

1704
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,445
What did she look like?
Can you remember?

1705
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:13,680
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman-

1706
01:57:13,715 --> 01:57:16,565
tall, dark,
exquisitely dressed.

1707
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:19,765
- Rebecca.
- The lady must have used an assumed name.

1708
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:25,480
Is that so? This is a surprise.
I'd known her a long time.

1709
01:57:25,515 --> 01:57:26,880
What was the matter with her?

1710
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,965
My dear sir,
there are certain ethics.

1711
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,340
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,
for Mrs. de Winter's suicide?

1712
01:57:32,375 --> 01:57:35,680
For her murder, you mean. She was
going to have a kid, wasn't she?

1713
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:37,525
Come on, out with it!

1714
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,565
Tell me what else a woman of her class
be doing in a dump like this?

1715
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:43,400
I take it the offiicial nature of this
visit makes it necessary for me to-

1716
01:57:43,435 --> 01:57:47,400
I assure you we'd not be troubling you
if it were not necessary.

1717
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:49,765
You want to know
if I can suggest any motive...

1718
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,360
as to why Mrs. de Winter
should have taken her life?

1719
01:57:52,395 --> 01:57:55,480
Yes, I think I can.

1720
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:00,760
The woman who called herself
Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.

1721
01:58:00,795 --> 01:58:04,165
She was not
going to have a child?

1722
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,845
That was what she thought,
but my diagnosis was different.

1723
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:13,000
I sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and X-rays,

1724
01:58:13,035 --> 01:58:16,645
and on this date she returned
to me for his report.

1725
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,600
I remember her standing here
holding out her hand for the photograph.

1726
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:22,645
"I want to know the truth,"
she said.

1727
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,480
"I don't want soft words
and a bedside manner.

1728
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:28,137
If I'm for it,
you can tell me right away. "

1729
01:58:28,172 --> 01:58:30,866
I knew she was not the type
to accept a lie.

1730
01:58:30,901 --> 01:58:33,525
She'd asked for the truth,
so I let her have it.

1731
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:37,560
She thanked me and I never
saw her again, so I assumed that-

1732
01:58:37,595 --> 01:58:40,480
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.

1733
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,245
<i>Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.</i>

1734
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,080
<i>An operation would have been
no earthly use at all.</i>

1735
01:58:48,115 --> 01:58:50,725
<i>In a short time,
she would have been under morphia.</i>

1736
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:54,200
<i>There was nothing that could
be done for her, except wait.</i>

1737
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:57,960
<i>[ Maxim ]
Did she say anything when you told her?</i>

1738
01:58:57,995 --> 01:59:01,125
<i>She smiled
in a queer sort of way.</i>

1739
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,920
Your wife was a wonderful woman,
Mr. de Winter.

1740
01:59:03,955 --> 01:59:06,680
And, oh yes,
I remember she said something...

1741
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:09,560
that struck me as being
very peculiar at the time.

1742
01:59:09,595 --> 01:59:12,297
When I told her
it was a matter of months,

1743
01:59:12,332 --> 01:59:15,000
she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. "

1744
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,880
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.

1745
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,525
We shall probably need
an offiicial verifiication.

1746
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,565
<i>- Verifiication?
- Yes, to confiirm the verdict of suicide.</i>

1747
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,480
<i>[ Dr. Baker ] I understand. Can I
offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?</i>

1748
01:59:29,515 --> 01:59:32,480
<i>[Julyan ] No, very kind.
I think we ought to be going.</i>

1749
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:37,080
Thank heaven we know the truth.

1750
01:59:37,115 --> 01:59:38,965
Dreadful thing, dreadful.

1751
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,645
Ayoung and lovely woman like her.
No wonder-

1752
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:46,080
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.

1753
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:49,400
I wish I had a drink.

1754
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:51,880
Will we be needed at the inquest
any further, ColonelJulyan?

1755
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,480
Oh, no. I can see to it that Maxim
is not troubled any further.

1756
01:59:54,515 --> 01:59:56,680
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you ready to start, Colonel?

1757
01:59:56,715 --> 01:59:59,125
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.

1758
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:02,965
And let me tell you, Favell,
blackmail is not much of a profession,

1759
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,600
and we know how to deal with it in our part
of the world, strange as it may seem to you.

1760
02:00:06,635 --> 02:00:08,880
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1761
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,845
But if you ever need a new car,
Colonel,just let me know.

1762
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,760
It's impossible to thank you for your
kindness to us through all this.

1763
02:00:14,795 --> 02:00:17,400
- You know what I feel without my saying anything.
- Not at all.

1764
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:20,245
Better let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.

1765
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,160
Yes, I'll phone her at once, then
we'll get straight down to Manderley.

1766
02:00:23,195 --> 02:00:26,280
Good-bye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.

1767
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,360
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?

1768
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,600
There's something you don't know.

1769
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:41,160
Oh, no, there isn't.

1770
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,365
I didn't kill her, Frank.

1771
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,280
But I know now that when
she told me about the child,

1772
02:00:53,315 --> 02:00:55,445
she wanted me to kill her.

1773
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,480
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.

1774
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:01,280
That's why she stood there
laughing when she-

1775
02:01:01,315 --> 02:01:03,800
Don't think about it anymore.

1776
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Thank you, Frank.

1777
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:13,240
Hello, Danny?
I just wanted to tell you the news.

1778
02:01:13,275 --> 02:01:17,000
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.

1779
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:20,845
Yes, suicide.

1780
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,765
And now Max and that
dear little bride of his...

1781
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:27,480
will be able to stay on at Manderley
and live happily ever after.

1782
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,680
Bye-bye, Danny.

1783
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,645
- Is this your car, sir?
- Yes.

1784
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:39,560
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.

1785
02:01:39,595 --> 02:01:41,445
Oh, isn't it?
People are entitled...

1786
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:43,525
to leave their cars
outside if they want to.

1787
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:47,000
It's a pity some of you fellows
haven't anything better to do.

1788
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,965
When you phoned,
did she say she'd wait up?

1789
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,960
I asked her to go to bed,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

1790
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,360
I wish I could get some
more speed out of this thing.

1791
02:02:00,395 --> 02:02:02,725
Is something worrying you, Maxim?

1792
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:05,680
I can't get over the feeling
something's wrong.

1793
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,160
- Frank!
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?

1794
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,125
What's the time?

1795
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,960
Oh, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?

1796
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:00,165
<i>That can't be the dawn
breaking over there.</i>

1797
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:02,760
It's in the winter that
you see the Northern Lights, isn't it?

1798
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:07,680
That's not the Northern Lights.
That's Manderley!

1799
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:32,680
Frith! Frith!
Mrs. de Winter. Where is she?

1800
02:03:32,715 --> 02:03:34,680
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?

1801
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:43,000
Maxim.

1802
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,045
Thank heaven
you've come back to me.

1803
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,960
- Are you all right, darling? Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I'm all right.

1804
02:03:49,995 --> 02:03:52,645
Mrs. Danvers. She's gone mad.

1805
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:55,680
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley
than see us happy here.

1806
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,000
<i>[ Robert ]
Look! The west wing!</i>

1807
02:04:55,001 --> 02:05:06,001
