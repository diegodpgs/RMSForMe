1
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,161
All hands on deck.
Be advised.

2
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,245
All good. All good.

3
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
How'd you pull that off, Cole?

4
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,961
Just a roughneck who got lucky.

5
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,326
I see that.

6
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,204
Hey, Mom. What are you doing?

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,041
Thinking. Avoiding the dishes...

8
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,922
- Nice out.
- It's beautiful.

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,331
Yeah, it is.

10
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,651
How are you doing?

11
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Just thinking about next fall.
About leaving.

12
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,646
What's gonna happen to me.
Just the rest of my life. No big deal.

13
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,571
You know, there are whole civilizations
that used to believe

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,126
they could see their destiny
in the stars.

15
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,731
You feel that kick?

16
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,169
Mom, are you OK?

17
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,366
Man that ramp!

18
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,091
Blowout preventer!
Hit the blowout preventer!

19
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,521
Hey, buddy! Hey, come here.
We're gonna get you out of here.

20
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,723
Hey! Hey!

21
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,520
Get him up the deck.

22
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,641
Go!

23
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,681
That's an...

24
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,205
You're the company's
hero, Mr. Cole.

25
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,363
Those two men you saved
are gonna be just fine.

26
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,410
If your vitals stay stable,
you can go home tonight.

27
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,731
It's incredible. You were in the
water almost four hours.

28
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,930
No evidence of hypothermia.
The fall alone should have killed you.

29
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,930
It's a miracle
that you're alive, Mr. Cole.

30
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,651
There's just no other
word for it.

31
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,364
Is there anyone we can call
to come get you or...?

32
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,002
Uh, no. I'm good.

33
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,528
<i>When I was young,
I looked for a shape to things.</i>

34
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,001
<i>A reason or a design.</i>

35
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,084
<i>So much of what happened to me,
though, felt like an accident.</i>

36
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,162
<i>So I guess I lost faith
in all that.</i>

37
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,291
<i>When I survived my fall,
I began to wonder</i>

38
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,966
<i>if there wasn't some purpose to
my life.</i>

39
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,042
<i>Maybe I was on a
destined path...</i>

40
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,129
<i>...even if I couldn't
see it yet.</i>

41
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,766
Go, go, go, go, go!

42
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,088
You're looking good
in there, Michael Phelps.

43
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,965
Hey, hey, have you
decided on a major yet?

44
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,890
- Not really.
- He's thinking about finance.

45
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,725
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

46
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,041
Look, it's tough out there
and it's getting tougher.

47
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,849
Finance makes the most sense.

48
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,321
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, grab me a Bud?
- Yeah.

49
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,323
All I said was he's thinking
about it.

50
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,571
Here.

51
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,889
You know, Pop, honestly the only thing
I'm thinking about is the beach

52
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,804
and what girls on the beach will
or will not be wearing this summer.

53
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,531
- Reynolds' residence.
- Amanda Collier, please.

54
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,568
Amanda Reynolds now,
but Amanda Collier.

55
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah, you found her.

56
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,967
Amanda,
my name is Morgan Dupree

57
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,084
<i>and I'm the estate attorney
for Tuck Hostetler.</i>

58
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,526
Oh, God.

59
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,725
- Hello?
<i>- Dawson Cole, please.</i>

60
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,124
Yeah, this is he.

61
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,123
<i>My name is Morgan Dupree.</i>

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,249
<i>I'm the estate attorney
for Tuck Hostetler.</i>

63
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,403
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

64
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,768
<i>Mr. Hostetler died
in his sleep last night.</i>

65
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,569
<i>He was 92.</i>

66
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,609
Look, I'm sorry about
your friend. I really am.

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,842
But we've got stuff
going on here.

68
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,331
I got to be at Tulane on Saturday
for the Sigma Nu thing.

69
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,201
Monday night we've got the dinner
with the guy from Chase and his wife.

70
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,569
Next time someone I know dies,
I'll call your secretary first.

71
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,041
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,846
Yeah.

73
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,371
Amanda?

74
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
Dawson?

75
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,691
Hey, Amanda.

76
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,881
Hi.

77
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,803
Man, I'm sorry I'm all
messed up.

78
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,889
How did you find out?

79
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,407
I got a call from a lawyer.
Something in Tuck's will.

80
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,403
I'm supposed to meet
with him tomorrow.

81
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,650
- 10:00am?
- Yeah.

82
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,404
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh.

83
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,330
It's been a long time.

84
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,122
Twenty years.

85
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,647
Well, 21, but I mean,
who's counting?

86
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,011
You look amazing.

87
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,680
I gotta go. I'm late.

88
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,524
Meeting my mom.
I'm gonna meet her.

89
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,730
- Oh, all right.
- At her house.

90
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,564
Yeah.

91
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,847
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

92
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,361
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

93
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,967
- Yeah, the lawyer.
- The lawyer.

94
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,965
It's 10:00am.
That's right. OK.

95
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,804
Hey, Dawson.
Hey, Dawson?

96
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,483
- Food's here.
- Thanks, April.

97
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,689
- How you feeling?
- She was throwing up a lot.

98
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,762
But I'm not now, so that's good.

99
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,050
- She's so pretty.
- She sure is.

100
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,166
You OK?

101
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,006
It's going to be tough, but...
her parents are really good to us.

102
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,650
They don't judge us.

103
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,085
They just want a Bible name
for the kid.

104
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
What do you
think about Aaron?

105
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,049
I think it's better than Moses.

106
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,646
I know it's crazy
and we're young, but...

107
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,808
the other day when I felt
that little heartbeat...

108
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,962
I don't know. It made
me feel happy.

109
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,685
That's good, Bobby.
That's real good.

110
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,084
It would just start I think...

111
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,448
But it's not...

112
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,851
Just try again.
Try again.

113
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,321
- I'm sorry. Tell them I'm sorry.
- April, it's fine, OK?

114
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,960
Put it in neutral. We'll push you
out of the way. Come on, Bobby.

115
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,880
What's the matter?
You forget how to drive?

116
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,001
Your dad take your
learner's permit?

117
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,402
Come on! Move your car!

118
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,363
You guys wanna get out
and help us push

119
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,647
or you just gonna sit there
and keep honking?

120
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,245
- It won't happen again.
- Yeah, sorry.

121
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,122
Thank you. Ma'am.

122
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,206
- Hey, we could be friends.
- What? Let's go!

123
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,931
Will you boys grow up!

124
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,161
Where are you going?

125
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,604
Over to the right, April.

126
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,807
Hi.

127
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,205
All right. Good.

128
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,645
OK.

129
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,689
- Should I call a tow truck?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

130
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,966
I'm sorry about my friends.

131
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,202
They try to be funny but only
succeed at being idiots.

132
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,244
- Amanda, let's go.
- Yeah, come on, let's get out of here.

133
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,483
- OK!
- Come on!

134
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,040
- Amanda.
- Seriously.

135
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,969
It's all right.
You don't have to wait around.

136
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,444
Oh. OK.

137
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,161
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah. Anytime.

138
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,164
Amanda! You're wasting
your time.

139
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,361
Thank you.

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,201
Later!

141
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,690
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way

142
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,321
'cause you're my cousin and I
love you, but you are a jackass.

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,290
Did you not see the beautiful girl who
just pushed a car to try to talk to you?

144
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,283
She was being nice, all right?
She's nice.

145
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,927
- Yeah, she is. She's also hot.
- She is hot.

146
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,608
Start her up.
She'll be fine now.

147
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,126
- Thanks, Dawson.
- Go on. It's all right.

148
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,401
See you later.

149
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,762
I turn the key and
nothing happens.

150
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,329
What do you think?

151
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,880
Karmic payback for being
party to the honking?

152
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,326
I think the universe
dispenses swift justice.

153
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,880
He speaks.

154
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,724
He's sort of funny.

155
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,444
- Hey, Amanda.
- Hey.

156
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,568
- Try it now.
- OK.

157
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,010
Thank you.

158
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,923
Your battery got disconnected.

159
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,208
It's not major. It happens.

160
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,286
All right.

161
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,642
Are you actually
about to say something else?

162
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,126
My cousin thinks you were trying
to talk to me the other day.

163
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,721
I was.

164
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,530
- He thinks I blew it.
- You did.

165
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,723
You don't know how to flirt,
do you?

166
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,805
Guess not.

167
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,683
Well, what are you gonna do
about it?

168
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,964
OK. This isn't working.

169
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,088
OK, I'll tell you what. Uh...

170
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,409
I want you to think about it
and, uh...

171
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,247
...meet me at Squeals
Saturday night at 6:00... maybe?

172
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,881
- Is that a yes?
- Yeah.

173
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,529
OK. Maybe you'll figure out
how to flirt with me by then.

174
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,249
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Where you runnin' off to,
Dawson?

182
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,728
I expect you to say hello.

183
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,761
Hello.

184
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,561
- You're cute.
- He is cute.

185
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,484
Looks like his daddy.

186
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,530
Come on in here. Sit down. Let's play
a hand of cards or something.

187
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,331
No, I'm... I got stuff to do.
I got homework.

188
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,970
He thinks he's smarter than us.

189
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,362
Abee, why don't you take that stupid
goddamn hat off in the house.

190
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,970
- Yes, sir.
- Is that true?

191
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,331
- You think you're smarter than us?
- No, sir.

192
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,807
- You too good for this family?
- No, sir.

193
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,441
That's good.
'Cause this is where you belong.

194
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
Here.

195
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,444
<i>Why don't you go out back
and tune up the Merc.</i>

196
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,888
We got a delivery upriver tomorrow
night and you're going with us.

197
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,369
I can't go tomorrow night.
I got something to do.

198
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,200
You didn't listen to a goddamn
thing I said, did you?

199
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,202
- I'm not...
- I'm not what?

200
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,844
Hey, hey, come on, Pop.

201
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,729
Let's play some cards.

202
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,087
I swear to God, Dawson,
you are a slow fucking learner!

203
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,368
That's a bad thing to be.

204
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,411
You still got someplace
to be Saturday night?

205
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,241
Yes, sir.

206
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,449
- Hit him again, Papa.
- Ted, shut the hell up!

207
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,930
You wanna hit me?

208
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,167
You hit me,
you see where that'll get you.

209
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,162
Hormones.

210
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,208
That's what his problem is.

211
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,920
You are either the worst car thief
in the history of the world...

212
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,082
...or you have a story to tell.

213
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,084
- What's your name?
- Dawson Cole.

214
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,328
- Tommy Cole's boy?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,371
Well, that is unfortunate.

216
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,922
- What happened to your eye?
- I just ran into a tree.

217
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,889
A tree with a mean right cross.

218
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,648
You got any place to stay?
Friends? Anything like that?

219
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,046
No, sir.

220
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,564
Shit.

221
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,085
Where you going?

222
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,202
That cot over yonder ought to be
more comfortable than this car.

223
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,241
Water out of the hose is good
to drink.

224
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,482
If there's any trouble, anything
goes missing, anything like that,

225
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,042
the next one to wake you up will be
a sheriff's deputy. You understand that?

226
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,009
- Yes, sir.
- Do you understand that?

227
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,286
Yes, sir.

228
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,245
All right, then.

229
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,526
Shit!

230
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,011
Good night, Amanda.

231
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,284
<i>♪ Little Miss, Little Miss,
Little Miss can't be wrong ♪</i>

232
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,090
Where is he?

233
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,451
- I decided not to come.
- Mm, yeah, I got that.

234
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,170
I didn't know how to get a hold
of you.

235
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,811
Oh, I was at Squeals. You could
have gotten a hold of me there.

236
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,408
Do you live out here?

237
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,562
Is this some kind of game
you're playing?

238
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,847
Huh? With your friends? A little science
experiment you got going on? What is it?

239
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,127
- That's crazy.
- That's crazy, is it?

240
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,611
Or maybe you just like strays.

241
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,843
Or maybe I like smart guys who
haven't had it handed to them.

242
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,888
Right.

243
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,202
God, you just don't get it,
do you?

244
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,884
I guess I don't.

245
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,888
You know, I just wanted a date.

246
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,042
I wanted to go somewhere and maybe
have some coffee or some ice cream.

247
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,600
Come on, you know, you ask me
questions, I ask you questions.

248
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,887
And if we just so happen
to like the answer, Dawson,

249
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,928
then maybe we'll go on
another one.

250
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,048
And if we don't, then we won't.

251
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,482
But God, I mean, if that's just
too much to ask, then fine.

252
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,687
Forget it. I'm exhausted.
I'm done.

253
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,607
This is why I didn't want to
go out in public.

254
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,121
Well, then take me
somewhere private.

255
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,922
So what're you
gonna do after high school?

256
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,207
Uh...

257
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,401
OK, I'll go first.
I'm going to Tulane in the fall.

258
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,450
Double majoring in child
psychology and public policy.

259
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,251
I'm hoping to intern
at a law firm while I'm there.

260
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,608
And then after law school,
I'd like to work for a non-profit.

261
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,571
Maybe in another country,
that deals with children's issues.

262
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,001
- You wanna work with children?
- Mm-hm.

263
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,923
You wanna have a family
of your own?

264
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,322
Yeah, I would.
I'd like to have a little girl.

265
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,965
Maybe name her Bea.

266
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,370
That's a real nice name.

267
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,562
It's really beautiful out here.

268
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,968
I've never seen so many stars.

269
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,406
I've always loved the stars.
I feel closer to them up here.

270
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,447
When I was a kid,
I built my own telescope.

271
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,683
- Wow.
- No, it's pretty easy.

272
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,967
Yeah, for you, maybe.

273
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,008
Humans have always
looked to the stars.

274
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,560
Instruct their way of life,
consult them.

275
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,408
You were gone
for a while.

276
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,086
Yeah, my dad made me
quit school when I was 16.

277
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,289
He said he needed me
around the home.

278
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,284
How do you feel
about that?

279
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,843
I don't know. I guess
I didn't like it much.

280
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,001
It was a hell of a fight to
come back.

281
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,649
Is it weird to be there now?

282
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,401
Kind of.

283
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,801
I mean, I just
wanna finish, get out.

284
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,084
Where do you want to
go to college?

285
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,689
Do you think everyone goes
to college?

286
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,531
People who build
their own telescopes usually do.

287
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,165
I don't know, it's just...

288
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,848
it's not something I can do
right now.

289
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,809
Is it something you want to do?

290
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,681
- Why do you care?
- Why won't you answer?

291
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,366
You are gonna be
a really good lawyer someday.

292
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,522
Do you want to go,
yes or no?

293
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,681
No.

294
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,602
You're a bad liar.

295
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,491
I like that.

296
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,162
I'd like to do this
again sometime.

297
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,441
I'd even shower and show up.
How about that?

298
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,605
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

299
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,811
I guess I wanted to do that.

300
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,803
I wanted to do that, too.

301
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,291
Good to know.

302
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,443
I wouldn't mind doing
that again.

303
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,570
Then do it.

304
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,122
Now first thing that Tuck
stipulated was for me to apologize

305
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,885
on his behalf for
any inconvenience.

306
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,851
He asked that I pass on
his gratitude

307
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,005
for your being here
and your friendship always.

308
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,889
His words.

309
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,928
He would like you
to spread his ashes together,

310
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,367
outside the cottage
of Vandemere.

311
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,171
There is to be no funeral,

312
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,050
no reception,
nor store-bought bouquets.

313
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,124
Not a dime is to be
spent on frivolities.

314
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,487
- Again...
- His words.

315
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,289
That's right.

316
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,728
He asks that you pack up his things
and he would like you to go through it,

317
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,564
and take whatever you want.

318
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,611
He left instructions that his assets
be liquidated and that the proceeds be

319
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,163
donated to the American
Pediatric Cancer Society.

320
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,329
The only asset not to be sold
is the cottage at Vandemere,

321
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,846
which he left to you both.

322
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,810
Now, typically, in situations
like this,

323
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,644
one party will buy the
other out,

324
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,281
unless you're interested
in joint ownership.

325
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,130
- We're not.
- No. No.

326
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,681
When he was in the hospital,
he wrote these. Mm-hm.

327
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,722
Excuse me. He would
like you to read them on your own.

328
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,447
Well, you still living
around here?

329
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,124
- Baton Rouge.
- Yeah?

330
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,769
- I see you got married.
- 18 years.

331
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,763
Nice. You guys got kids?

332
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,888
- Two.
- Boys? Girls?

333
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,405
You know, we don't have to do this.
Ask the questions, tell our stories,

334
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,528
pretend to want to know
about each other's lives.

335
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,250
Well, I do want to know.

336
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,485
We're not here for a reunion.
We're here for Tuck, so...

337
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,246
How about this? You go to the house
today and I'll come out tomorrow.

338
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,002
And we'll meet out at
Vandemere tomorrow afternoon.

339
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,491
We'll say our goodbyes.

340
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,122
- Does that work for you?
- Yeah.

341
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,641
Bye.

342
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,244
I'm sorry.

343
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,002
<i>You remember that thistle problem
I had in the garden last year.</i>

344
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,284
<i>Thistle is one tough weed.
You can't pull it or mow it.</i>

345
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,488
<i>You have to dig it out by the root.</i>

346
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,010
<i>While I was digging,
I got to thinking about you and Dawson.</i>

347
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,290
<i>You have wounds that
have never healed.</i>

348
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,364
<i>You've lived with them so long,
you don't even know they're there anymore.</i>

349
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,329
<i>Pain has deep roots.</i>

350
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,602
<i>The only way to dig it out is to
forgive him and forgive yourself.</i>

351
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,680
<i>- Don't you get bored out here?
- Completely.</i>

352
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,564
When are you gonna let me
get my hands dirty?

353
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,166
You want
to get your hands dirty?

354
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,926
Absolutely.

355
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,609
What? This dirty?

356
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,887
No. Dawson,
you're not gonna do...

357
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,201
'Cause I'm the grease monster
from the bayou!

358
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,123
Stop it!
Dawson! Don't!

359
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,000
You're gonna get me all dirty,
you little punk!

360
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,441
You gotta leave!
You gotta get out of here.

361
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,682
- What?
- No, please, just get out of here now.

362
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,728
- Who's that?
- Get out of here, please! Leave!

363
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,444
- Dawson! You're hurting me!
- Leave!

364
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,171
- Don't ask any questions. Get out! Now!
- Why do I have to go?

365
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,322
- Go, go, go! Go, please!
- OK, Dawson.

366
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,890
- OK.
- Go!

367
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,121
OK!

368
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,246
Time to come home, Dawson.

369
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,168
You didn't introduce us
to your girlfriend.

370
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,806
That's that Collier girl, Pop.
You know her.

371
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,484
- Collier girl.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,690
All right, get your stuff,
put it in the truck.

373
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,286
- You're coming home with us.
- No, I'm not.

374
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,331
I ain't gonna tell you again,
boy.

375
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,042
I have had it with you, Dawson!

376
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,283
You're all puffed up,
you're thinking that you're special.

377
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,364
Well, let me ask you something?
Do you really believe that that girl

378
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,764
is gonna have anything to do with
a white trash piece of shit like you?

379
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,324
No. Come on.

380
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,971
Get your stuff, put it
in the truck and let's go.

381
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,524
You touch him again,
the next one will kill you.

382
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,167
Now, I've come here for my boy
and I ain't leaving without him, so...

383
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,563
I guess you're gonna
have to shoot me.

384
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,206
All right.

385
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,286
That windshield is gonna
cost you about $1,000.

386
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,840
And those floods run about
$500 each.

387
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,130
Do you want me to keep going?

388
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,606
Go on now.

389
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,765
This is nice.
What you've done here.

390
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,891
Your wife plant these?

391
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,521
Get in the truck, Ted.

392
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,326
If I stay, they'll come back.

393
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,007
I just shot up a $17,000
pick-up truck.

394
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,969
About broke my heart to do it.

395
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,247
They'll be back
whether you're here or not.

396
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,925
Not safe for you to sleep out here
anymore. I'll fix you a place inside.

397
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,966
Well, come on.

398
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,081
Dawson...

399
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,123
- What are you doing?
- I had to see you.

400
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,407
- Well, come in.
- That's not a good idea.

401
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,086
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

402
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,925
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I mean, if you're not gonna come in.

403
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,207
- My parents think you're dangerous.
- They're right.

404
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,886
Sooner or later, I'm gonna have
to pay for what happened today

405
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,327
and I can't have you standing
next to me when I do, OK?

406
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,926
- I can't have you getting hurt.
- I'm not gonna get hurt.

407
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,968
You hang around with me
long enough and you will.

408
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,362
I don't care! I don't care!

409
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,731
I mean, Dawson, do you want this?
Do you want me?

410
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,401
I do.

411
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,721
I do.

412
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,001
All right.

413
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,442
- Just give me one second.
- Sure thing.

414
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,931
You work here?

415
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,124
No, sir. Just picking up
some stuff for my uncles.

416
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,002
You look a lot like
an old friend of mine.

417
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,166
- People tell me I look like my dad.
- Yeah?

418
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,326
Bobby Cole?

419
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,806
You knew him?

420
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,444
Goddamn it, Aaron. How many
times I gotta tell you that you...

421
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,048
Well, as I live and breathe.

422
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,441
Man 2: The Prodigal Son returns.

423
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,922
You might wanna stay away from
that shit. Good talking to you.

424
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,202
It's been a long time,
Dawson!

425
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,926
About 20 years?

426
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,401
Thank you.

427
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,361
Thank you.

428
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,967
- You know who that is, Aaron?
- That's Dawson Cole.

429
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,125
I thought maybe you'd
need a hand.

430
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,525
Hey. I thought you might
want this.

431
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,890
You can take it.

432
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,486
I just didn't want to pack things away
if you might want to keep 'em.

433
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,962
It's OK. I don't want much.
I'll make my own box.

434
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,041
OK.

435
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,203
- What? What is it?
- Nothing.

436
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,250
Is there something you
want to say?

437
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,810
No.

438
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,041
I guess I just want to know
if you're happy.

439
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,806
You want facts?

440
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,530
I... went to Tulane, as planned.

441
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,608
Got pregnant sophomore year,
not planned.

442
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,803
Got married, moved to Baton Rouge.
Bought a house.

443
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,726
Had another baby. Did some volunteer
work. Bought a bigger house.

444
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,641
Law school?

445
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,728
I didn't finish college.

446
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,204
I had so many plans
and I don't know what happened.

447
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,520
Life?

448
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,041
I guess. Anyway.

449
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,567
Am I happy?
Being a mother makes me happy.

450
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,723
Look what I found.

451
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,441
Oh, wow.

452
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,330
I forgot he had this.

453
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,730
She's a real beauty.

454
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,966
Thanks.

455
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,447
So if you're not going to college,
then why do you study so much?

456
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,769
Oh, wait, I know why.
Because you are going to college.

457
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,446
You'll definitely get in.
You'll probably get a scholarship.

458
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,761
- Grab the stuff from the back, please?
- I got it.

459
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,125
All right, these are
applications.

460
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,360
- I know what they are. I've seen them.
- All right. Well, get started on them.

461
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,290
- There's a problem.
- Already? You haven't even started yet.

462
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,441
They want a home address.

463
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,690
You live with Tuck.
Why don't you ask him?

464
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,569
- No, don't ask Tuck, please.
- Why?

465
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,770
He's private. He won't like you snooping
around and stuff... Amanda!

466
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,086
- OK!
- Amanda.

467
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,410
- Tuck?
- In here.

468
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,849
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

469
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,366
Wow, you look handsome.
Here, I got you these.

470
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,364
They're chocolate covered pralines.
I hope you like them.

471
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,364
- Can I ask you a couple questions?
- OK.

472
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,371
- Do you have an onion?
- I do.

473
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,329
Good. 'Cause we forgot one.

474
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,370
Second thing, we were just going over
Dawson's college applications

475
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,410
and we were wondering, can we use
your address as his home address?

476
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,411
- That'll be fine.
- Great.

477
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,961
Let's get cooking.

478
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,124
- Maybe you should set the table.
- Maybe I should set the table.

479
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,243
Wow, those are beautiful.

480
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,927
Yeah, they came in real good this year.
It was a wet spring.

481
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,365
- These are my wife's favorite.
- Oh, yeah?

482
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,850
How long were y'all married?

483
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,365
We're still married.
We're just on different schedules.

484
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,643
She had a stroke
four years ago this May.

485
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,245
I'm sorry.

486
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,563
There's still times that
I'll step outside there at night

487
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,404
and have a little chat
with Clara.

488
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,121
Ain't that foolish?

489
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,606
<i>All I'm saying is when two cars
break down on consecutive days,</i>

490
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,763
that bring two people together
that fall in love, that's destiny.

491
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,367
Destiny? No, Destiny is the name
the fortunate give to their fortunes.

492
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,680
What is that supposed to mean?

493
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,331
That means that people
never call bad things destiny.

494
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,482
You are absolutely impossible.
Why can't you just agree

495
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,289
with anything that I have
to say, Dawson? Why?

496
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,648
- Tuck, please help me out here.
- Come on, Tuck.

497
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,324
- What?
- What do you think?

498
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,165
I never did believe
in any of that stuff.

499
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,442
But I will tell you one
thing now.

500
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,566
Uh, back in the war,

501
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,167
I was in the Navy,
I'm serving aboard a destroyer.

502
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,251
And at the Leyte Gulf, we...
we took a Jap torpedo.

503
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,926
Blew me right off the deck.
Broke my back.

504
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,171
There I am bobbing around in
the water like a fishing cork,

505
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,847
all hell breaking loose
all around me and l...

506
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,365
I started singing.

507
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,523
This old Irving Berlin song.

508
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,367
<i>What'll I do with just a photograph
to tell my troubles to?</i>

509
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,647
<i>What'll I do? What'll I do?</i>

510
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,050
<i>What'll I do?</i>

511
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,562
Well, after a few verses of this,

512
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,849
this calm just, poof,

513
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,363
came over me and I knew right
then I was gonna be all right.

514
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,330
That I was gonna go home,
that I was gonna...

515
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,561
I was gonna hold my wife again.

516
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,481
Well, a few years pass by, we built
that little cottage at Vandemere and...

517
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,685
...I walked outside one day and Clara
was out there in the garden singing...

518
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,362
<i>What'll I do?</i>

519
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,641
Now, she saw the look on my face
and so I told her the story.

520
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,324
And then she told me hers.

521
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,323
It seems like right about that
same time, she'd had a dream.

522
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,842
A dream where I was
singing to her.

523
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,524
And you care to take a guess
at the name of the song?

524
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,369
Come on. Get out of here, Tuck.

525
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,570
Well, now, I don't know exactly
what you'd call that, but

526
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,564
whatever you call it,
it got me home.

527
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,645
Would you dance with me?

528
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,448
- You can dance?
- No.

529
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,126
But I figured you'd make me
learn sooner or later.

530
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,809
I guess you have a good point.

531
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,561
- Now, don't step on my feet.
- I'll try not to.

532
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,485
Hey, look at me.

533
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,321
Dawson?

534
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,131
I'd like to talk to you.

535
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,602
Four years after Jared was born,
Frank and I had another child.

536
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,761
A wonderful little girl.

537
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,802
She was so full of joy.

538
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,371
Tuck loved her.

539
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,011
"She shines with her own light,"
he said.

540
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,051
He was right about that.

541
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,805
She was diagnosed with leukemia a few
weeks after that picture was taken.

542
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,051
She'd just turned two.

543
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,171
And I remember that day.

544
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,170
You know, it was just a day.

545
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,011
And you want so much
to go back to just a

546
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,401
not-so-special day like that,
you know.

547
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,280
But you never can.

548
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,410
I can't imagine how difficult
that must have been for your family.

549
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,568
We both started drinking
too much.

550
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,529
I quit. He never did.

551
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,806
I wish I'd have been
there for you.

552
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,400
Yeah.

553
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,290
That didn't happen.

554
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,801
That's life.

555
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,481
What was her name?

556
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,330
Bea. Her name was Bea.

557
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,564
Bea.

558
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,162
You've gotten better at that.

559
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,811
Yeah, 20 years later,
I can chop an onion.

560
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,681
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

561
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,604
I bet you're the smartest guy
on the rig, huh?

562
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,170
Well, of course I am.

563
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,041
Yeah, you know, I got pretty good
at computer, actually,

564
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,122
and the boss wanted me
to go back to school,

565
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,124
get certified as an
IT specialist.

566
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,451
And let me guess.
You don't want to do that.

567
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,923
- I like my job.
- But you might like the new one more.

568
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,889
I don't know why you don't
go to college and get the piece...

569
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,086
Piece of paper.

570
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,686
- Well, I don't.
- Yeah, that's her.

571
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,924
That's the girl who
just wouldn't let me settle.

572
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,841
Yeah, well, I haven't
seen much of her lately, so...

573
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,851
Yeah, but there she is.

574
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,324
To her.

575
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,561
<i>Does it ever
get lonely out there?</i>

576
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,688
I mean,
are you asking me if I'm single?

577
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,886
Are you?

578
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,290
Well, I've had, you know,
relationships, I guess.

579
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,011
And things...

580
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,211
I mean, nothing...
Yeah, no, not right now.

581
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,805
You ever been in love?

582
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,766
With you.

583
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,722
<i>That was 20 years ago.</i>

584
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,847
Twenty-one.

585
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,445
Well, what do you want me to say,
you set a high bar.

586
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,130
Seriously?

587
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,527
Are you saying that
I'm the reason that you're alone?

588
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,648
Don't ask questions
if you don't want any answers.

589
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,245
That's ridiculous.

590
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,722
I mean, honest to God.

591
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,170
What? Why are you laughing?

592
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,730
I don't know. I guess I just...

593
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,122
I miss this.
I miss... you getting all mad at me.

594
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,123
I'm not mad.

595
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,531
You're being a little pushy.

596
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,965
I'm not pushy.

597
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,644
You just care so much, Amanda.

598
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,764
You just can't help yourself.

599
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,966
I should go.

600
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,767
- What?
- This is dangerous.

601
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,931
We've had wine...

602
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,811
...and somehow you have gotten
better looking, which is so annoying.

603
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,487
Couldn't you have gotten bald
or fat or something? Jesus!

604
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,485
You know, it seems a little silly to
take two cars to Vandemere tomorrow.

605
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,689
I have a confession to make.

606
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,407
OK.

607
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,689
It wasn't destiny when
my car broke down at school.

608
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,082
I disconnected the battery myself
so you could save me.

609
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,643
- I know.
- What?

610
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,120
I know. I knew the minute I saw
your battery line yanked out.

611
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,562
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you tell me?

612
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,611
How often is the mechanic
the hero of the story?

613
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,282
<i>Oh, I gotta go to Vandemere.
Tuck's been putting it off for weeks.</i>

614
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,409
<i>Now his back's out,
he's worried about the garden.</i>

615
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,164
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

616
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,969
You go take care of
Tuck's garden.

617
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,682
<i>He needs you. I just want you.</i>

618
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,206
- Maybe next weekend.
- Can't wait.

619
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,725

be a public broadcast on fly fishing.

- I guess it's just a gift.

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,886

- I've been practicing.

- Tuck.

So, Dawson, tell me,
what are your plans for the future?

689
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,164
Well, I hope to go to
college next year, sir.

690
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,007
He is going to college.
He got a 4.0 and 1520 on his SATs.

691
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,765
Well, that's good, son.
Where did you apply?

692
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,242
I applied to Tulane,
Loyola and LSU.

693
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,563
I mean, I'll probably end up at LSU.
It's the most realistic.

694
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,244
Yeah, and it's not too far
from New Orleans,

695
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,163
that way we could
still see each other, right?

696
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,322
I take it you know
a few things about cars.

697
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,086
- Yeah, a little, I guess.
- I got a bunch of them in the back.

698
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,242
Yeah, Amanda said you
have a collection.

699
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,561
- How many cars you own?
- Too many.

700
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,084
A few. Would you like to
see them?

701
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,051
- Recognize that one?
- It's a '71 Oldsmobile 442.

702
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,849
You know why they call it that?

703
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,129
Yeah, a four barrel carb,
four speed gear box, dual exhaust.

704
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,010
It's a beautiful car, sir.

705
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,004
Smart boy. I can see why she
likes you.

706

Wow.

709
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,768
Say, have you given any thought
to how you'll pay for college?

710
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,607
There's... There's scholarships,
financial aid, loans, stuff like that.

711
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,526
Tuition's a killer. And you need money
for books, room and board.

712
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,241
It's expensive.
It can be prohibitive for kids like you.

713
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,926

714

I'd like to help you, if you'll let me.

715
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,361
Well, how's that, sir?

716
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,166
Well... four years of school,
say...

717
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,802
$15,000 a year for tuition.

718
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,043
Another five to live
comfortably.

719
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,644
You want to give me $80,000?

720
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,165
If you'll let me.

to make something of yourself.

724

This isn't personal, son.

725

726
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,405
and I can't have her
anywhere near your family.

727
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,124
It's gonna end anyway.

728
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,607
This way, you get something out
of it.

729
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,884
- I don't want your money.
- What's that?

730
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,531

My dad's an asshole.

01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,411
He's right,

You're gonna do great things.

739
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,762
I don't want to get in the way
of that.

01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,723

me?

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,920

745
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,164
There's not enough money
in the world.

746
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,720
Well, I mean, if he was gonna throw in
that Cobra, I'd have to think about it.

747
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,524

777
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,686
We do.

778
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,127
Oh! Oh, shit. Oh!

779
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,445
- Just scatter it.
- Yeah?

780
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,601
Yeah, just...

781
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,845
Oh! OK. Well, maybe we throw it.

782
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,647
- That was much better.
- Yeah. OK. Here.

783
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,843
- To Tuck.
- To Tuck.

784
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,001
- Sure you don't want another one?
- No. Nah, I'd better not.

785
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,362
- When are you going home?
- Tomorrow.

786
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,846
Last time I was out,
there was this explosion.

787
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,487
Wait, that was your rig?
You were on it?

788
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,722
Yeah, I fell 100 feet into
the water.

789
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,244
I still have no idea why I
didn't drown.

790
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,130
I wasn't wearing a vest.
Doctors couldn't figure it out either.

791
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,285
- God, you were lucky.
- Maybe.

792
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,527
I saw you.

793
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,801
I had, like, a...

794
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,726
It wasn't a dream.
You were there with me.

795
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,640
And it was strange 'cause
I hadn't seen you in so long.

796
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,763
And then I get out of the hospital
and I get this call about Tuck.

797
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,530
Then I come here and
I see you.

798
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,161
And it's like...

799
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,366
I don't know. Just strange.

800
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,005
I'm glad you're OK.

801
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,491
What are you gonna do,
Amanda?

802
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,601
What do you mean?

803
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,090
If you're unhappy.

804
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,967
Wait.

805
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,091
You got all this advice
for me, you know?

806
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,006
What are you gonna do?

807
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,248
You know what this feels like
to me?

808
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,449
Fate. That's what it feels like
to me.

809
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,087
I'm trying to get my head around it
since it all happened.

810
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,642
Why the hell am I still here?
And maybe it's 'cause of this, you know?

811
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,281
Maybe it's a chance
to see you again and...

812
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,764
a chance to tell you how sorry
I am.

813
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,402
And tell you how much I still
love you.

814
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,448
You want me to fall back
in love with you?

815
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,641
How do I do that
if I haven't ever stopped?

816
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,845
- Tuck?
- Yeah.

817
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,642
I... I got you something.
It's not much at all, but...

818
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,920
...I didn't want you to have to worry
about a dry spring anymore.

819
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,040
Yeah.

820
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,445
She'll need one of these.

821
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,608
Tuck, no one's ever treated me
like you have.

822
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,966
No one's ever shown me

823
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,566
- this kind of dignity and respect.
- Your tie is crooked.

824
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,440
- How about a smile, Tuck?
- This is a smile.

825
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,811
Oh, shoot.

826
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,801
Whoo!

827
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,006
Get down there!
Get on down there!

828
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,762
- Come on, g-up, mule.
- Smile pretty.

829
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,691
Oh, oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.

830
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,402
Wake up, you gotta wake up.
I want you to see this.

831
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,684
Now, look at that.

832
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,491
- There it go! There goes the squash.
- Whoo!

833
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,644
Just about ready to pick.

834
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,085
Let me ask you something.

835
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Those pretty tulips right there,
all those flowers.

836
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,281
Not the tulips.

837
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,011
Did you and your wife plant those?

838
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,323
Come on, you get a good look.
Get a good look.

839
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,207
Hey, I forgot Amanda's flower thing.
Can we turn around?

840
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,123
- Oh, yeah, it's just right there.
- Yeah.

841
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,124
Mayhall can't even tie his shoe.

842
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,242
It's Tuck! Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Get out, get out!

843
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,804
Tuck! Tuck!

844
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,888
Call 911! Go, now!

845
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,129
Bobby, you go help!
Go help, go help, go help!

846
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,482
Tuck! Tuck, what happened?

847
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,929
I ran into a tree.

848
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,530
Bobby, you stay with him.
You help him.

849
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,281
Tuck.

850
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,846
Someone's on their way, Tuck.
OK? You're gonna be OK.

851
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,370
- Dawson! What are you gonna do?
- Go on, stop him now.

852
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,201
- Dawson, don't do this!
- Just talk to me!

853
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,526
Give me the gun.

854
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,204
- Just give him the gun, Dawson!
- Get out of the truck, Bobby.

855
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,169
Don't do this. It's what
he wants.

856
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,049
- Get out of the truck, Bobby!
- No!

857
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,647
- Bobby! No!
- Stay with Tuck. Stay here with Tuck.

858
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,643
- It's gonna be OK.
- Bobby!

859
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,721
Dawson.

860
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,725
- Bobby!
- Stay here.

861
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,489
Cool down, cool down,
cool down!

862
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,401
Just think!

863
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,926
Dawson, come on.
Turn the car around. Come on!

864
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,321
Stop! This is stupid.

865
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,325
Dawson, you don't want
to do this.

866
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,890
Told you he'd come back.

867
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,530
- Stay back, Bobby.
- Dawson.

868
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,971
- Stay there!
- Uh-oh.

869
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,601
You know, the last person
that pointed that rifle at me,

870
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,284
he had an accident.

871
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,686
He tripped down his
wheelchair ramp.

872
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,806
Look at him.

873
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,882
Look at you,
you're all dressed to kill.

874
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,247
Is that what you are?
You're a killer now?

875
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,641
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill all three of us?

876
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,326
No. Just you.

877
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,682
Why don't you go on and
do it then?

878
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,127
- Put down the gun, Dawson!
- Oh, he will.

879
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,528
Don't worry, Bobby.
I know this one.

880
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,451
He ain't no killer.

881
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,562
You're not a killer, son. Here.

882
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,851
You ain't nothing.

883
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,089
- Hell, no.
- Ted! Hey, Ted!

884
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,731
Get up!

885
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,040
Get up!

886
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,767
I gotta tell ya.
I didn't see that coming.

887
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,201
Yeah, Papa!

888
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,206
Come on, hit him!

889
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,891
Get up, Papa!

890
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,610
You got this.

891
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,361
Dawson, that's enough!
You're gonna kill him. Come on!

892
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,645
Come on, Dawson.

893
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,167
Dawson, look out!

894
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,565
Bobby. Bobby!

895
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,931
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, no, no.
Bob, Bob, look at me, look at me.

896
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,331
Look at me, Bobby!

897
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,051
Bobby...

898
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,602
I'm so sorry!

899
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,524
<i>Bobby was getting out.</i>

900
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,124
<i>He was gonna be a dad.</i>

901
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,807
<i>Tuck, he was gonna be
such a good dad.</i>

902
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,882
<i>He's the only family I ever had.</i>

903
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,406
Look at me, son.

904
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,084
I said look at me.

905
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,049
The DA doesn't want you.

906
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,564
He wants Tommy.

907
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,328
If you help them,
then they will help you.

908
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,925
I killed him, Tuck.

909
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,164
I deserve to be here.

910
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,402
Yeah, you showed up there
with a loaded gun

911
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,926
and...

912
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,930
...you're gonna have to
do some time for that.

913
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,368
But, son, there is a reason
that you are here.

914
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,522
You have a life to live.

915
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,207
And you're gonna fight back and
you're gonna keep fighting back.

916
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:42,604
'Cause no matter what you think,
you are not just your father's son.

917
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,208
Dawson, you are not
like them other boys.

918
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,328
You're a good boy.

919
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,408
And you're
my boy.

920
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,767
You hear me?

921
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,649
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

922
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,965
Yes, sir.

923
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,049
<i>This is the DEA.
We have the house surrounded.</i>

924
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,210
Ted!

925
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,124
Do you see any of those individuals
present in the courtroom at this time?

926
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,326
I do.

927
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,131
Can you point out
Abee Cole at this time?

928
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,203
Can you also point out
Theodore "Ted" Cole at this time?

929
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,406
Yes.

930
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,885
Can you also point out Thomas
"Tommy" Cole at this time, please?

931
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,284
- Hey.
- Hey.

932
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,804
I brought you some books
and things.

933
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,721
Thanks.

934
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,530
You just let me know if I need
to bring anything else for you

935
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,523
and I'll bring it next time,
all right?

936
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,047
- There can't be a next time.
- What do you mean?

937
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,524
I got eight years.

938
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,210
I mean, it's, what, four before
I'm even eligible for parole?

939
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,123
- I'll wait.
- No.

940
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,009
No, I can't let you do that.

941
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,642
You don't get to make
that choice.

942
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,200
If this was the last time
you're gonna see me...

943
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,851
...what would you say?
- Please don't do this.

944
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,925
I'd say thank you.

945
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,402
- I'm not walking away.
- I'd say I love you.

946
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,370
- Dawson.
- I always will.

947
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,647
Dawson, please don't do this.
Please.

948
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,688
I love you.

949
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,041
Wait, Dawson! Dawson!

950
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,446
Dawson! Dawson!

951
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,125
- Ma'am, I need you to come with me.
- OK.

952
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,770
- OK.
- Please.

953
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,643
- Oh, God.
- Please come with me. Come with me.

954
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,971
- Right this way.
- OK.

955
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,400
Thank you.

956
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,690
Excuse me.

957
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,491
<i>Brentwood,
please come to the front.</i>

958
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,767
He's not taking any visitors.

959
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,644
Collier.

960
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,247
I'm sorry, Miss Collier.
He doesn't want to see you.

961
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,406
OK.

962
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,723
- Man. Back again, huh?
- Yeah.

963
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,531
<i>I went every day for a
month,</i>

964
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,807
and then every week for a year.

965
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,964
Did they tell you that I came?

966
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,565
They told me.

967
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,324
I guess maybe I hoped
they didn't.

968
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,324
Do you even know that I went
when Frank and I started dating?

969
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,000
I told him I was going
to see my parents.

970
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,371
They told me every time.

971
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,120
- And you didn't want to see me?
- That's the only thing I did want.

972
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,162
I never stopped loving you,
Amanda. Not once.

973
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,163
- Then why didn't you?!
- Because I...

974
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,163
- I know this doesn't make sense...
- It doesn't.

975
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,402
All right, Amanda. Listen to me.

976
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,882
I wanted to do something good.

977
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,368
And I wanted to save you
from some of the pain.

978
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,249
You didn't save me
from anything.

979
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,210
I lived with the pain every day
of my life, Dawson, and I blame you.

980
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,567
I blame you for thinking you knew
what was best for me

981
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,008
- when it was you that was best for me.
- I know.

982
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,162
I couldn't have you
wait for me.

983
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,403
- There was so much you wanted to do.
- But I wanted to do it with you.

984
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,642
And I would have waited
for as long as it took.

985
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,849
- I didn't deserve you, Amanda.
- Oh, deserve me?

986
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:57,328
Jesus, Dawson.
Don't you understand?

987
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,368
When I had Jared,
and I know this is wrong,

988
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,001
but do you know that when I had him
I wanted to tell you.

989
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:09,081
And when I lost Bea...
I wanted you to hold me.

990
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,769
And when I was alone
at night, I wanted...

991
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,883
I wanted you and I cried for you

992
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,804
and I hated you
and I hated you because...

993
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,882
because I would have chosen you
no matter what,

994
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,088
and you took that away from me.

995
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,563
- I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

996
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:32,486
I did. I hurt you.

997
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,563
But see, I still love you.

998
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,284
I still love you.

999
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,644
<i>Do you remember
the last time we</i>

1000
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,768
<i>were here and I turned
on the radio?</i>

1001
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,045
- <i>"Sweet Jane."</i>
- Yeah.

1002
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,205
God, I knew a song
would come in and then it did.

1003
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,089
- Clear as day.
- I know.

1004
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,007
As if it was cued up for us.

1005
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,367
You know, I used to feel that
way about everything.

1006
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,247
I'd just blindly trust
in life to work out.

1007
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,125
And then it would.

1008
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,368
I don't feel that way anymore.

1009
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,080
What?

1010
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,851
Where you going?

1011
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,680
Anymore, I don't like
to leave things to chance.

1012
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,321
Wow.

1013
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,571
You're not stepping on
my feet anymore.

1014
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,971
Well, not yet.

1015
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,961
Would you do one thing for me?

1016
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,769
Would you forgive yourself?

1017
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,083
You're a good man, Dawson.
Believe it.

1018
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,124
That shirt looks a lot better
on you.

1019
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,563
It's so cold.
Do you remember it being so cold?

1020
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,165
Nah, don't be a baby.

1021
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,205
- I'm not a baby.
- Come here.

1022
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,126
Lie back.

1023
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,567
- Happy?
- Yeah.

1024
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,922
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

1025
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:45,201
Hi, Jared. Yeah, I'm doing OK.

1026
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,326
How are you?

1027
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,484
Are his parents going?

1028
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,040
I just don't want you to get in the car,
you know, if anyone's been drinking.

1029
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,841
I know, but Mike can
barely drive if he's sober.

1030
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,604
All right, well,
just ask your dad.

1031
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,365
I miss you, too.

1032
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,283
All right, I'll see you
in a couple of days.

1033
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,328
OK, be careful. Bye.

1034
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,080
- Sorry. It's Jared.
- It's OK.

1035
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,163
We can't do this, can we?

1036
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,485
I know you, Amanda.

1037
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,331
I know your heart.

1038
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,849
You're the girl who came every day
for a month and every week for a year.

1039
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,805
You have a husband.

1040
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,127
And you have a son
that you love very much.

1041
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,728
You won't give up easy.

1042
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:57,121
These past few days
have been so good.

1043
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,491
A chance to see you
and to talk to you.

1044
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,604
To heal a little.

1045
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,124
To love you again.

1046
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,523
People spend their whole life looking
for that and they never find it.

1047
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,886
But we did.

1048
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,529
We're the lucky ones.

1049
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,130
No matter what happens, Amanda,
I want you to know

1050
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,929
how grateful I am.

1051
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,649
'Cause at the end of it all...

1052
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,970
...I get to say I know what it's like
to have loved someone.

1053
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,161
Truly love someone
because I've loved you.

1054
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,088
I have to go back.

1055
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,326
And I don't know how
I'm gonna say goodbye to you.

1056
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,530
I'll always be here.

1057
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,044
And I'll always love you.

1058
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,688
I'm gonna trust in the stars.

1059
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,120
Hello?

1060
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,687
Hey. I'm home.

1061
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,561
- You just get back?
- I did.

1062
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,605
How was it?

1063
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,566
Nice... Sad.

1064
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,411
How's your mom?

1065
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,446
She missed us at Easter.

1066
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,681
- It's a busy time of year.
- I said.

1067
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,291
- I got to, uh...
- I'll get dinner started.

1068
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,001
Wow.

1069
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,805
Cheers.

1070
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,006
Sorry.

1071
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,610
Hello, Chas.

1072
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,845
Uh-huh. Right, pal. No.

1073
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,764
Brooksie already told me
you shot eight over par, so...

1074
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,321
Eat.

1075
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,765
...you're busted.

1076
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,209
What the hell
are you doing out there, man?

1077
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,328
I saw you hacking away like it
was a...

1078
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,250
Oh, yeah, OK, no.
Blame it on the partner, that's good.

1079
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,846
Is that what you said about me
last week, you son of a bitch?

1080
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,491
<i>Dawson, over the years
I've come to know Amanda pretty well.</i>

1081
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,570
<i>She's got a lot of good
inside her.</i>

1082
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,449
<i>A lot of pain, too...</i>

1083
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,360
<i>...about the past, about you.</i>

1084
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,522
<i>I got you together here because I don't
want either of you living with regret.</i>

1085
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,085
<i>You two were meant to
love each other.</i>

1086
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,084
<i>You needed a chance to
remember that.</i>

1087
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,927
<i>I'm not saying you're gonna be
together. I don't know that.</i>

1088
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,363
<i>And if it doesn't work out,
you'll miss her so much</i>

1089
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,647
<i>you'll barely be able to move.</i>

1090
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,924
<i>You'll feel you have
no purpose...</i>

1091
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,203
<i>...no reason to go on.</i>

1092
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,247
<i>But there's nothing to do
but wait.</i>

1093
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,527
<i>Wait and it'll get clear to you.</i>

1094
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:44,046
<i>You'll get on with your life
and gifts will come into it.</i>

1095
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,361
<i>I was lost when Clara died.</i>

1096
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,681
<i>Then one day this kid
walks into my garage.</i>

1097
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:56,650
<i>I want you to know the gift you
were to me. I thank you for it.</i>

1098
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,445
I knew you were back.

1099
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,288
I saw the flowers on
Bobby's grave.

1100
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,921
I haven't had a chance
to do that in a while, April.

1101
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,362
We've been getting the money.

1102
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,244
You don't have to send that.

1103
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,044
You don't owe us anything.

1104
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,409
How'd you know it was me?

1105
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,051
Who else would it be?

1106
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,890
Who else would send cash
through the mail?

1107
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,926
I figured if I wrote you a check with
my name on it, you wouldn't cash it.

1108
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,523
We told him to get out
of the truck.

1109
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,322
We both did.
It wasn't your fault.

1110
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,289
It's just something that
lives in my head, you know?

1111
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,848
I play it over and over.

1112
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,851
Look at me. Look at me!

1113
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,848
Dawson, you didn't kill him.

1114
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,651
They killed him.

1115
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,688
And now it's Aaron.

1116
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,410
What do you mean?

1117
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,280
Ted and Abee started coming around
when he was about 14.

1118
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,364
They took him out. Eased him in.

1119
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,564
<i>You know, girls and cars
and booze</i> and...

1120
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,210
<i>So he's been
hanging around out there?</i>

1121
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,442
<i>All the time.</i>

1122
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,888
<i>He didn't get in any real trouble until
your father took him under his wing.</i>

1123
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:27,325
<i>And how he's running errands for them
and making deliveries.</i>

1124
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,409
<i>He's a good kid.
He's not like them.</i>

1125
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,010
<i>He's like his dad.</i>

1126
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,210
<i>He just doesn't know it.</i>

1127
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,811
What are you doing here?

1128
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,762
Aaron. I want you to
come with me.

1129
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,966
Why the hell would I do that?

1130
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,646
Dawson.

1131
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,801
They told me you were here.
What a surprise.

1132
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,763
It's not even my birthday.

1133
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:04,051
What line of bullshit
is he feeding you, son?

1134
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,728
He lives here now, with family.

1135
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:15,204
This is no family. It never was.

1136
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,169
Well, not to you, maybe.

1137
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,883
But you never figured that blood
counted for much, did you?

1138
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,204
I'll tell you what I do know.

1139
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,561
There was never an ounce
of love in this house.

1140
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,847
Oh... love.

1141
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,491
You're a weak piece of shit, Dawson.
You know that?

1142
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,484
You always were, you always
will be.

1143
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,927
- I'm weak?
- Mm.

1144
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,441
You were my father and you
treated me like an animal.

1145
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,761
I tried to make a man
out of you.

1146
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,685
But you didn't appreciate
a goddamn thing I gave you.

1147
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,643
And what did you give me?

1148
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,241
These?

1149
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,724
You are weak.
And you're not worth it.

1150
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,442
And I'm not gonna let you
ruin another person's life

1151
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,760
like you tried to ruin mine.

1152
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:06,481
I'm taking the boy, if he'll go.

1153
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:10,529
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me,

1154
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,444
because you're just a scared
old man

1155
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,568
who doesn't want to go
back to prison.

1156
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,405
Don't get in my way.

1157
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,446
It's all right.

1158
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,530
Amanda!

1159
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,561
Yes?

1160
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,805
I didn't know you were there.
Did you see my golf glove?

1161
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,688
- Can I talk to you?
- Nothing is where I left it.

1162
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,888
- Jesus, Frank.
- What?

1163
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,890
What do you want to talk about?

1164
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,125
Us.

1165
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,124
Come on, Amanda, I'm 20 minutes
late for my tee time with Hal.

1166
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,804
I can't do marriage counseling.

1167
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,161
- I've lied to you, Frank.
- About what?

1168
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:11,330
For a long time I have lied.
But I want to tell you the truth.

1169
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,966
OK.

1170
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,407
I saw someone this weekend.

1171
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,244
Someone I fell in love with
a long time ago.

1172
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,844
What, you mean, the guy,
the kid...

1173
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,206
- Dawson.
- Cole?

1174
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,647
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1175
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,169
I'm still in love with him.

1176
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,089
I didn't know I was going to see him.
I didn't expect to.

1177
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,767
But I'm glad I did because it made me
realize how completely lost

1178
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,729
- I have been.
- You sound a little crazy.

1179
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,802
I don't expect you
to understand.

1180
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,764
When I lost him,
I lost who I was.

1181
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,249
- Right.
- I lied to you, Frank.

1182
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,482
I have lied to you
and I have lied to myself.

1183
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,649
And I've tried to
make it work. We both have.

1184
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,609
But I can't do it anymore.

1185
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:06,048
So what? You want me to stop drinking?
Is that what you want?

1186
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,885
What I want is to stop sleepwalking
through my life.

1187
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,644
Then stop!

1188
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,929
I mean, just listen to yourself.
Get over it.

1189
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,923
No.

1190
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,810
Look, this is my life, too.
You don't just get to choose.

1191
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,247
Yes, I do.

1192
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,164
And I am done pretending.

1193
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:31,531
OK. Good.

1194
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,369
- What are you doing?
- Does it matter?

1195
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,205
<i>Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.</i>

1196
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:13,325
I was hoping maybe we
could talk.

1197
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,880
A lot of things have changed
since I last saw you.

1198
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:24,370
<i>And well, I just...
I want to say I love you.</i>

1199
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,569
I do, Dawson.

1200
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,090
<i>And I always have.</i>

1201
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,602
<i>All right, call me if you
have a moment.</i>

1202
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,961
Hello?

1203
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,329
Yes, this is his mother.

1204
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,683
Frank, it's the fourth time I've called.
Jared's at Delta West.

1205
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,888
I need you to come
as soon as you get this.

1206
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,491
Mrs. Reynolds?

1207
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,801
- How's my son?
- Post-op.

1208
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,486
We went in, had a look around.
He's stable for now.

1209
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,370
- All right, what happened?
- His car hit a tree,

1210
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,124
- he was thrown from the vehicle.
- Oh, my God.

1211
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,483
The blunt trauma from the accident has
resulted in serious damage to his heart.

1212
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,403
- What does that mean?
- Amanda!

1213
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,008
- Sorry. I was...
- Wait, Frank.

1214
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,326
What's happened?

1215
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,641
- Frank, just listen!
- What's going on? Where's my son?

1216
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,251
It means one of the valves
of his heart is torn.

1217
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,641
<i>It's my determination
that we can't repair it.</i>

1218
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,324
<i>What does that mean,
exactly?</i>

1219
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,130
<i>He needs a transplant
and very soon.</i>

1220
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,962
<i>Doctor, I have lost one
child already. I cannot lose another.</i>

1221
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,605
<i>I understand.</i>

1222
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,886
<i>Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.</i>

1223
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,366
<i>I was hoping maybe we
could talk.</i>

1224
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,841
<i>A lot of things have changed
since I last saw you.</i>

1225
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,449
<i>I wanted to say I love you.</i>

1226
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,125
<i>I do, Dawson.</i>

1227
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,321
Come on!

1228
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,486
Abee! Abee!

1229
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,921
Ted!

1230
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,283
Oh, hell! Where is he?

1231
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,449
What's going on? What happened?

1232
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,444
They're prepping him for surgery.
They found a heart.

1233
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,529
He's got a chance now.

1234
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,770
Amanda.

1235
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,321
Dawson.

1236
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,167
What are you doing here?

1237
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:26,484
Mom. I overslept.
I gotta get back to the hospital.

1238
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,245
Jared's all right, sweetheart.
I just spoke with Frank.

1239
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,601
All right. Let me get dressed.
You'll come with me, right?

1240
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,880
Jared will want to see you.

1241
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,931
Amanda.

1242
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,805
Yeah, Ted and Abee. Both down.
All right, thanks, sheriff.

1243
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,331
No, I can bring 'em down.
That's all right.

1244
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,640
I got nothing but time.

1245
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,370
I can bring 'em to you.
That sounds good.

1246
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,244
- Dawson Cole!
- You got it.

1247
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,131
I'm so sorry.

1248
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,770
Oh, God!

1249
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:29,362
I commend the soul
of Dawson Cole to God.

1250
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,321
Amen.

1251
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,206
Children's Legal Defense Fund.
Yes, of course, hold please.

1252
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,045
- Hi, doll. Your ex called.
- Thanks, Jamie.

1253
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,447
- Hey. So what'd you figure out?
- Hey.

1254
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,841
Well, after weighing everything
that we discussed,

1255
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,844
it is my recommendation that
we go all the way back to 1959.

1256
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,844
We can look at the UN's declarations
of the rights of the child

1257
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:23,082
and we can structure
our argument from there.

1258
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,844
Good. Thank God for paralegals.

1259
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,524
But if we do that, we have to
make sure that we

1260
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,921
keep in mind the 1976...

1261
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,411
Sorry, it's my son.

1262
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,801
Well, we are the
Children's Defense Fund.

1263
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,328
- Hi, Jared.
- Hey, Mom.

1264
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,404
<i>- Everything OK?</i>
- <i>Uh,</i> yeah.

1265
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,320
Why wouldn't it be?

1266
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,768
<i>Well, this is your third phone call
in two days. That's a record for you.</i>

1267
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,921
Very funny.

1268
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,322
<i>No, I'm actually calling because there's
something that I wanted you to know.</i>

1269
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,886
<i>You remember how Dr. Charbonneau
told me that if I waited a year</i>

1270
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:54,361
<i>I could file a request to find out
who donated my heart?</i>

1271
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,284
Yeah. Did you decide
to go ahead with it?

1272
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,601
<i>Well, actually, I did go ahead
with it.</i>

1273
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,011
Oh.

1274
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:04,727
And I got the information yesterday.
So, here, give me one second.

1275
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:09,409
<i>Yeah, it says he was 39 years
old when he died.</i>

1276
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,289
<i>Get this, he was actually
from St. Olivia,</i>

1277
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,647
<i>so I thought that maybe you
knew him.</i>

1278
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,324
<i>Dawson Cole.</i>

1279
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,685
Mom, you there?

1280
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,729
Yeah. I'm here.

1281
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,489
<i>So, did you know him?</i>

1282
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,608
Yes. I knew Dawson.

1283
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,963
Great, so when I'm home for Spring Break
maybe you can tell me a bit about him.

1284
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,966
- I <i>would love</i> that.
<i>- Oh, hey, Mom, I gotta go.</i>

1285
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,289
<i>I'm meeting this girl for lunch.
She's in my English class.</i>

1286
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,726
<i>- OK.
- I'm totally loving it here.</i>

1287
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,288
<i>All right, I love you, Mom. Bye.</i>

1288
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,726
Everything all right?

1289
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,250
Yes. It is.

1290
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,801
Good.

1291
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,203
So, like I was saying,
if we start in 1959, we can...

1292
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,603
<i>Dear Amanda,</i>

1293
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:30,002
<i>when I was young,
I looked for a shape to things.</i>

1294
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,042
<i>A reason or a design.</i>

1295
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,528
<i>So much of what happened to me,
though, felt like an accident.</i>

1296
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,682
<i>So I guess I lost faith
in all that.</i>

1297
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,524
<i>When I survived my fall,
I began to wonder...</i>

1298
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,961
...if <i>there wasn't some
purpose to my life.</i>

1299
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,891
<i>Maybe I was on a destined path,</i>

1300
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,724
<i>even if I couldn't see it yet.</i>

1301
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:59,209
<i>When I saw you again, I believe
we'd been given a second chance.</i>

1302
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,366
<i>That the universe
had decided to give us that.</i>

1303
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,524
<i>You have commitments,
I understand,</i>

1304
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,125
<i>and you want to keep them.</i>

1305
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,529
<i>I can only love you more
for that.</i>

1306
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:16,165
<i>I hope to see you again someday,
but if I don't...</i>

1307
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:21,490
<i>...just know that these last days
have been the best of my life.</i>

1308
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,086
<i>I love who I am
when I'm with you, Amanda.</i>

1309
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,049
<i>You are my dearest friend,
my deepest love.</i>

1310
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,648
<i>You are the very best of me.</i>
