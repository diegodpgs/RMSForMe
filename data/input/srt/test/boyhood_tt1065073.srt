1
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,615
Hey, love bug.
You ready?

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,735
Yeah.

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,375
Hey, guess what, Mom?
What?

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,215
I figured out where
wasps come from.

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,855
Yeah? Where?

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,135
Well, I think it must be,

7
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,455
if you flick water into the air
just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,375
Hey!
Yep.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,606
That's cool.

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,175
So, how was your day at school?

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,015
Fine.

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,215
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler
this time. I kind of liked her.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,175
What'd she say?

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,895
Well, she said that you weren't
turning in your homework assignments.

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,175
And I told her,
"I know he does them,"

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,855
"'cause I check them
every night."

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,405
She said she found
a big chunk of them

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,855
crumpled up at the bottom
of your backpack.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,495
She didn't ask for 'em.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,251
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're
just supposed to turn them in.

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,085
And she said you're still
staring out the window all day.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,210
Not all day.

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,884
And she said that you destroyed
her pencil sharpener.

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,935
Not on purpose!

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,167
Wait! She said that you crammed
a bunch of rocks in it.

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,215
I thought if we could
sharpen pencils,

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,055
maybe we could sharpen rocks.

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,605
Well, what were you gonna do
with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,050
I was trying to make arrowheads
for my rock collection.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,535
Dude, my turn!

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,607
Hold on.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,448
Mason!

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
Samantha!

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,362
Tommy! Is Mason down there?

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,761
Yeah.

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,655
Well, tell him he has to
come home to dinner.

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,170
Okay.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,495
Hey.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,648
Hey, sweetie.
Why aren't you ready?

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,055
Hey, Mason.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,127
Hey, Ted.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,206
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go.

43
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,215
What time is it?
It's 9:00. Let's go, let's go!

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,415
Okay, I meant to call you,
'cause Janice flaked out.

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,895
I don't have a sitter.

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,295
Why didn't you
call somebody else?

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,815
I can't get a babysitter now.
It's 9:00.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,775
But you're welcome to
hang out with us.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,495
Well, no!
I mean, we have plans.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,363
The guys are expecting me.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,967
Well, you can go.
All right.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,722
I'll come back in
a couple of hours.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,410
Is that okay?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,368
Yeah. Yes, it's okay.
All right.

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,895
"'Turn back! Turn back! I don't
wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle."

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,415
"'Who? said Harry,
as they backtracked quickly."

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,895
"'She haunts one of the toilets"

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,135
"in the girls' bathroom on the
first floor, said Hermione."

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,295
"'She haunts a toilet?"

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,935
"Yes, it's been
out of order all year,"

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,095
"'because she keeps having
tantrums and flooding the place!"

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,200
"'I never went in there
anyway, if I could avoid it."

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,045
"'It's awful trying to have a
pee with her wailing at you."'

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,695
Why can't you just say that?

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,879
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,695
- I don't wanna go with you.
- You're sorry, that's bullshit!

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,055
That's right. I wanna
stay here with my kids.

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,175
That's what I'd rather do.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,282
Would you stop using
your kids as an excuse?

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,535
I know you have to stay here
with your kids! You're acting...

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,535
You have this immature life.
You have no responsibility!

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,615
I have an immature life!

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,935
I have responsibility.
I have an immature life.

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,015
You don't know what
it's like to be a parent.

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,055
No, I don't!

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,135
And why am I responsible
for your mistakes in life?

77
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,455
Don't call my kids mistakes!
Don't!

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,695
I didn't call your kids...

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,535
You said, "Your mistakes in your
life," pointing at my kids.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,975
I know what I said, you know. And
immediately you use your kids again.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,335
This is the reality.
I'm a parent!

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,135
- That means responsibility.
- I know you're a parent.

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,975
I would love to
have some time to myself!

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,895
I would love to just
go to a fuckin' movie!

85
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,135
You don't think I'd like that?

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,335
Go have some dinner,
go to a bar!

87
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,775
I don't even know
what that's like!

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,855
I was someone's daughter, then I
was somebody's fuckin' mother!

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,609
Okay? I don't know
what that's like!

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,761
Stop!

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,441
Quit it!

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,961
Quit it!

93
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,450
Mom!

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,329
What the hell is
going on in here?

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,055
Do you guys
know what time it is?

96
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,811
He's throwing things at me.

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,015
Mason! Do not throw
things at your sister!

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,935
She's faking, she hit me first!

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,615
Listen, both of you!

100
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,695
I'm going back to bed.

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,975
I don't wanna hear another
peep out of here for an hour.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,001
Go to sleep.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,531
- Faker!
- Guys!

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,649
Awesome!

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,321
Look what I found in the street.

106
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,681
Dude!

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,691
I know, right?

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,684
Look at those.

109
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,010
Look at those!

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,161
Awesome!

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,615
So listen, guys, I wanna
talk to you about something.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,295
And you might not like
this idea at first,

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,970
but we're moving to Houston.

114
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,361
When?

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,655
Well, soon.

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,815
We should be out by the first,

117
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,600
so we don't have to pay
two rents next month.

118
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,095
No, Mother, we're not moving.
Nope, nope.

119
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,726
Sorry, Mom. Nope. Nope.

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,368
Samantha, I have to
go back to college,

121
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
so I can make us
a better living.

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,011
With this job, I can't take
care of us the way I'd like to.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,495
I can't keep going this way.

124
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,170
And Grandma said
she'd help us out,

125
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,135
and it would be nice
to be near her.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,127
Fine, Mother.

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,575
You can do whatever you want,

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,523
but we're not moving.

129
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,645
And what about our friends?

130
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,095
Baby, we can
email them or write.

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,724
We can come back to visit.

132
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,055
And guess what?

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,535
This place that
Grandma found us,

134
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,086
you'll each have
your own room. Right?

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,084
And there's a pool.

136
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,647
Mom, do you still love Dad?

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,769
I still love your father,

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,565
but that doesn't mean it was
healthy for us to stay together.

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,088
What if after we move he's
trying to find us and he can't?

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,648
That won't be a problem.

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,015
He can call Grandma
and she'll tell him,

142
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,610
or he can call Information.

143
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,331
We won't be hard to find.

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,570
Is he still in Alaska?

145
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,206
Well, that's what your uncle says.

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,206
Probably taming
polar bears or something.

147
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,965
Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him.

148
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,335
Here, wanna help me out?

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,535
Sure.

150
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,615
Okay. Take this paint
very carefully

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,935
and paint any little
smudge or mark or anything

152
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,375
on the baseboard there,

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,802
behind the door and all around
the doorways on the inside.

154
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,335
She says we're gonna come visit

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,488
and I'm gonna write
and call you.

156
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,002
Wait, hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

157
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,085
Hello?

158
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,055
Sorry, Tommy.

159
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,615
Mason can't come over today.
We're moving.

160
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,055
And I'm on the other line.

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,127
Bye.

162
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,925
Althea?

163
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm gonna be sending
Sailor Scout instructions.

164
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,171
Email and write back telling me
how the other scouts are doing.

165
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,841
Well, because
you're the leader now.

166
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,895
Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna
get there before it gets dark.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,535
Goodbye, yard. Goodbye, crape myrtle.
Goodbye, mailbox.

168
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,135
Goodbye, box of stuff Mommy
won't let us take with us,

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,815
but we don't wanna throw away.

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,841
Goodbye, house.

171
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,055
I'll never like Mommy as
much for making us move!

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,415
Samantha!

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,295
Why don't you say goodbye to that
little horseshit attitude, okay?

174
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,335
'Cause we're not taking
that in the car.

175
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,490
Goodbye, old lady who listens
to rock music and rides a motorcycle.

176
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,041
Hey!

177
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,210
What's happening back there?
Stop, put the barrier up.

178
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,375
Hey! Put the pillow
between you.

179
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,095
Make a barrier,
come on. Stop.

180
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,895
We're gonna play a game
called The Game of Silence.

181
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,084
Whoever can stay quiet for the
longest period of time wins.

182
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,322
You guys think you can do that?

183
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,082
Okay, go.

184
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,882
The bus will be here
in 10 minutes.

185
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,321
Put that homework
in your backpack.

186
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,450
Go eat!

187
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,415
Baby, go eat.

188
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,726
I am!

189
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,895
Speak English!

190
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,935
Shut up! Mom!

191
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,849
She's speaking that
stupid language again!

192
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,882
Samantha!

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,775
I was speaking perfectly
clear English, Mother.

194
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,723
He's a little slow in the head.

195
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,455
He did officially
flunk first grade.

196
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,655
Sit your butt down!

197
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,284
Yes, sir, Mother, sir!

198
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,935
All right, listen up, guys. Grandma's
gonna pick you up after school.

199
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,335
Your dad's in town for the day.

200
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,771
So you're gonna spend
the afternoon with him.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,082
Is he moving back?

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,775
I don't know.

203
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,087
We haven't seen him
in about 80 years.

204
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,090
Like a year and a half.

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,695
Please.

206
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,615
Can we please eat here?
The bus is coming.

207
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,687
Who wants syrup?

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,884
All right, nice cursive.

209
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,175
Okay, Mason, when I check the
mobiles, am I gonna find yours?

210
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,255
No.

211
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,375
And why not?

212
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,215
'Cause I didn't finish it.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,015
Well, it's time to finish it.

214
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,415
Just a minute.

215
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,886
No, let's do...
Apple Quit.

216
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,483
Time to finish your work, Mason.
"Apple Quit."

217
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,045
So this is my history test.

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,721
"A+", very good.

219
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,375
And that's another history test.

220
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,129
And another

221
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,243
Yeah, it doesn't have
a plus, but, well.

222
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,015
And then, um, that's
my report on lizards.

223
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,455
Let me see your pictures.

224
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,895
Yeah.
These are my pictures.

225
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,135
What is that?

226
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,335
Well, that's called a dewlap.

227
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,935
A dewlap, okay.

228
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,495
Yeah, this is a math test.

229
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,695
"A" again.

230
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,455
Mase, that's the last
candy, okay?

231
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,084
Okay.

232
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,841
We need to put this stuff up.

233
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,603
That's him.

234
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,091
Daddy!

235
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,335
My God! Look at
you, you're so big!

236
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,895
Hey, MJ.

237
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,255
What's happenin', buddy?

238
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,375
You guys ready to have some fun?

239
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,415
Yeah!

240
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,169
Yeah! All right.

241
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,175
Hey, Catherine, how are you?
Mase, I'm good.

242
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,295
Good to see you.
Yeah.

243
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,335
What time should
I have these rascals back?

244
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,095
I don't know,
around 7:30, I guess.

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,295
I gotta get them
home by 8:00.

246
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,415
You know what, why don't I
take 'em over to their mom's?

247
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,135
No, that's okay.
She's expecting me.

248
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,335
No, that's all right. You guys
know where it is, don't you?

249
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,015
Yeah. All right. I'll do it.
It's no problem.

250
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,175
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

251
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,615
Look, it's no problem.
All right?

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,575
You guys ready to go? Let's do it, go!

253
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,255
Go? Wait a minute.
You gotta get your stuff.

254
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,930
You got backpack, your purse,

255
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,644
homework, go to the bathroom.

256
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,935
Can't believe how big they are.

257
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,281
Yeah. Time's going by.

258
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,815
Must be nice for you,
having 'em here in Houston.

259
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,650
I love it, yeah. I'm
volunteering at their school.

260
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,604
Yeah? What you doing
over there?

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,923
I'm in the library. You know,
reading to the little ones.

262
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,929
Great.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,525
So, Alaska?

264
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,721
Yeah.

265
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,245
Are you back?

266
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,601
We'll see.

267
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,881
How's Liv?

268
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,364
She's a busy girl.

269
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,049
She's back in school.

270
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,135
But she's working
and single parenting.

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,003
A lot to juggle.

272
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,815
- You guys got everything?
- Yeah.

273
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,975
All right, say goodbye
to your grandmother.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,135
Bye, Grandma.

275
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,208
All right, let's roll.
No, wait a second.

276
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,135
You're not the type of kids
who like presents, are you?

277
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,730
Yes!
No, you don't.

278
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,888
Of course we do. Presents?
Really? Let's do it!

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,286
Yay!

280
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,095
I call front seat!

281
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,375
I wanted the front seat, though.

282
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,135
All right. Well, Mason
gets it on the way there

283
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,810
and Samantha gets it
on the way back.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,002
- Hop in there.
- Seat belts!

285
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,095
Seat belts.
All right. Seat belts.

286
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,645
Don't forget your seat belts.

287
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,485
It's not like this car
has any seat belts.

288
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,695
Nice. Nice. Nice!

289
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,935
Come here, come here, yes!

290
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,008
That was awesome!

291
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,495
Get up there, Mason! Get up there!
It was so good!

292
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,760
Come on.

293
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,175
Let 'em know who you are, buddy.

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,964
Let 'em know who you are.

295
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,283
Yes! Yes! Yes!

296
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,249
All right. All right,
don't worry about it.

297
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,165
Wish we could use the bumpers.

298
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,215
Bumpers are for kids!

299
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,215
What are you, two years old?

300
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,855
You don't want the bumpers.

301
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,928
Life doesn't give you bumpers.

302
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,775
There we, there we go. There we go!
We got something there!

303
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,695
We got something!
We got something!

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,129
Last time I went bowling, we had
bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,015
You don't want the bumpers,
all right?

306
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,495
You bowl a strike
with the bumpers

307
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,135
and it doesn't mean anything.

308
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,207
Trust me.

309
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,121
Just lay it out on the lane.

310
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,961
One, two, three and...

311
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,775
Let's hear it for the father!

312
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,801
Boom!

313
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,015
- Get up there!
- Great shot!

314
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,281
Get out there, girl!

315
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,935
<i>Four Blackwater
operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

316
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,495
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

317
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,935
<i>The bodies and cars were set on
fire after insurgents started...</i>

318
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,689
Look at this!
It's a disaster.

319
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,815
Let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, all right?

320
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,415
Exactly what every thinking
person in the world

321
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,575
knew was gonna happen
before they got started.

322
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,295
But Bush and his little numb-nut
fanatics he's got around him,

323
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,560
they don't give a rat's ass.

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,761
That's a quarter.

325
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,215
What's a quarter?

326
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,605
You said A-S-S.

327
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,655
Sorry. My bad.

328
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,935
And my teacher says
it's a good war,

329
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,935
because it's better
to be safe than sorry.

330
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,175
That's what they're
teaching you in school?

331
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,415
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?

332
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,935
That is the lie.
That's the big lie.

333
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,575
Iraq had nothing to do with what
happened at the World Trade Center.

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,601
You know that, right?

335
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,287
I guess.

336
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,410
Who you gonna vote
for next fall, MJ?

337
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,135
I don't know.

338
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,810
He can't vote.
He's not 18.

339
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,280
All right,
who would you vote for?

340
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,575
Kerry?

341
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,215
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

342
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,163
Are you gonna move back?

343
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,444
I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.

344
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,366
Are you and Mom
gonna get back together?

345
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,761
I don't know.

346
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,929
That's not, entirely
up to me, you know?

347
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,415
I remember when I was six,

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,175
you and Mom
were fighting like mad.

349
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,443
You were yelling so loud
and she was crying.

350
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,815
That's what you remember?

351
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,895
Yep.

352
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,215
You don't remember
the trips to Galveston,

353
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,535
camping in Big Bend,
all the fun we had?

354
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,561
Nope.

355
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,335
You ever get mad at your mother?

356
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,439
Yeah.

357
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,090
You ever get mad at your brother?
Yeah.

358
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,295
Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Yeah.

359
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,575
Doesn't mean you
don't love him, right?

360
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,815
Look, the same thing happens
when you're grown up, all right?

361
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,375
You know, you get mad at people.

362
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,721
You know, it's not a big deal.

363
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,724
What'd you do in Alaska?

364
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,370
I worked on a boat
for a while. Um...

365
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,322
I tried to write some music.

366
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,295
Did you see any polar bears?

367
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,415
No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.

368
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,855
It was fuckin' huge!

369
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,929
Dad! That's 50 cents
for the F-word!

370
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,655
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,889
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.

372
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,167
You guys are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me. Okay?

373
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,735
I missed you two real bad while I was
gone, okay, I want you to know that.

374
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,082
I just needed to take some
time, you know, to...

375
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,441
Just...

376
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,242
Your mom and me, okay...

377
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,735
Well, your mother, okay,
is a piece of work, all right.

378
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,003
I think you know that
by now, all right?

379
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,645
And I'm just...

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,571
I'm so happy to be
with the two of you, okay?

381
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,935
And I'm sorry about
that bumper business.

382
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm gonna get better
at stuff like that, okay?

383
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,895
I got that one
at Dripping Springs,

384
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,287
and, um, my friend Rodney
gave me that one.

385
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,935
- Yeah?
- And I bought that one.

386
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,455
You bought this one?
Yeah.

387
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,775
You found this at Dripping Springs?

388
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,006
Wow.

389
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,735
What else do you got?

390
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,842
Well, um,
these are snake vertebrae.

391
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,566
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting.

392
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,200
Mason, I don't want you collecting
snake vertebrae anymore.

393
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,415
Is this the feather I sent you?

394
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,975
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it is.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,295
Dad! Um, I forgot to show you,
um, these basketball pictures.

396
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,975
You're on a basketball team?
Yeah.

397
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,455
Wow! Check you out!

398
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,855
These are beaver claws.
Beaver claws?

399
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,881
That's me.

400
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,975
- Yeah. No.
- What, you hunting beaver?

401
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,815
You see, that's McKinney,
that's Meg and that's Gem.

402
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,895
Those are my friends.

403
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,135
What position do you play?

404
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,295
Um, guard.

405
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,655
This is dried Canadian grass.

406
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,975
Wait, have you
scored any points?

407
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,215
Well, about eight or 10 a game.

408
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,455
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!

409
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,735
Once, she didn't score any
and she cried!

410
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,815
You cried?

411
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,055
Well, only a little bit.
Aw...

412
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,815
Hello!
Pomegranate.

413
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,495
Mason, Mom's home!

414
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,695
Mom's home!

415
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,846
Mom's home.

416
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,375
Mom! Hi! Look at this owl
Daddy gave me!

417
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,528
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!

418
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,486
And look at this bracelet. It
was made by Indians in Alaska.

419
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,175
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved
grizzly bear and this tiki.

420
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,015
- It's a totem.
- And guess what else?

421
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,169
We went bowling and I made four strikes!

422
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,895
Yeah, and we got to ride
around in Dad's car! Wow.

423
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,855
Hey, Liv.
Hey.

424
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,405
I know you wanted me to drop
them off at your mom's.

425
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,204
I just thought it'd be easier
if I brought 'em over here.

426
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,882
Well, it really
screwed up my plans.

427
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,175
Well, we just wanted
to show him our rooms.

428
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,295
Yeah.

429
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,360
Did you guys eat anything?

430
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,375
Well, we had some French
fries at the bowling alley.

431
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,695
Did you do your homework?

432
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,801
No.
Not yet.

433
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,448
Okay. Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

434
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,645
Yeah. Sure.

435
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,641
They had more than French fries.

436
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,410
Do you think he's gonna
spend the night?

437
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,088
Doesn't look like it.

438
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,527
<i>Okay.
An unconditioned stimulus,</i>

439
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,007
<i>something that produces
an unlearned,</i>

440
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,121
involuntary,
unconditioned response.

441
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,535
Now, in Pavlov's experiment,

442
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,927
what was the stimulus
that he used?

443
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,935
Come on now, people! Tough weekend?
What's the deal here?

444
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,775
Meat, right? Meat.
Meat powder, actually.

445
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,535
Whatever meat powder is,
it worked on this dog.

446
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,135
Okay, he put
the meat powder in there

447
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,575
and it produced an unconditioned
response in the dog, which was?

448
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,295
Salivation! All right?

449
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,655
Now, who can give me
another example

450
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,215
of an unconditioned
stimulus response pair

451
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,844
that happens to you every day?

452
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,329
It's probably happening
to some of you right now.

453
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,405
How about sex?

454
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,255
Sure, you know,

455
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,295
you see an attractive member
of the opposite gender,

456
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,415
you have an automatic response.

457
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,535
You don't have
to think about it.

458
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,324
Mick Jagger wrote
a song about it.

459
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,855
"When they call your name,"

460
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,895
"I salivate like
a Pavlov dog."

461
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,846
Thank you very much.
Class dismissed.

462
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,364
Doctor Welbrock.

463
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,286
This is my son Mason.

464
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,175
Mason, this is
Dr. Welbrock.

465
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,295
Your son.

466
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,129
Now see, I thought
this was a boy genius

467
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,607
who was taking my college course.

468
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,095
He wasn't feeling well today, so I
thought I'd bring him with me.

469
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,055
No fever.
It's a con job.

470
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,935
I can tell because I have a nine-year-old
son, he pulls this all the time.

471
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,535
Same kind of deal.

472
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,855
Hey, you play soccer?
No.

473
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,895
Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
He likes computers.

474
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,735
My 11-year-old daughter
loves soccer!

475
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,015
Who can figure?

476
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,855
Maybe we can get all you
guys together sometime?

477
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,405
Maybe, yeah.

478
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,615
Well, you ready to go?

479
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,641
Yeah.

480
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,923
Nice to meet you, Mason.
Nice to meet you, too.

481
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,247
And thanks for
coming to my class.

482
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,241
Olivia.

483
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,009
Nice kid.
Thanks.

484
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,085
So, you think, Grandma might be
available for a little babysitting?

485
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,328
Maybe.

486
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,815
Really?
Yeah.

487
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,365
Well, great.

488
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,895
<i>Dead man, dead man, wake up!</i>

489
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,242
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, you're alive!</i>

490
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,442
My turn.
Kids, they're here!

491
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,775
- They're home, they're home!
- Come on!

492
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,131
Hurry, hurry.

493
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,691
Hi!
Hi!

494
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,175
We're here!

495
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,328
How was it? How was it?
Hey! We've returned!

496
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,055
Honey, it's so good to see you.

497
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,815
Hi, Dad!
Samantha, Mason. Hello.

498
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,415
Thank you.
That's very nice.

499
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,442
Hey, Mom.
How are you?

500
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,815
Mom, Mom!

501
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,080
They give you trouble?
Look at the sign we made.

502
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,295
- Samantha and I made it all ourselves.
- Yeah.

503
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,055
I know the boys helped
you with that a lot.

504
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,003
No, not at all!

505
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,815
- That's good. Look at this.
- Okay. There you go.

506
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,888
Pass out the goodies.
This is for the girls.

507
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,135
Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.
It's in the...

508
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,295
Let's pour.

509
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,775
You take this big elevator up,

510
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,135
and when we got to the top,

511
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,215
we flew a paper airplane off.

512
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,575
- And what happened?
- It flew!

513
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,647
It flew away, it went for miles.

514
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:19,325
Went under the Arc de Triomphe, you know.

515
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,648
Did you guys kiss
under the Bridge of Sighs?

516
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,851
Yes.
Yes, we did.

517
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,935
Mom, can we see
your wedding ring?

518
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,291
Sure.

519
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,041
Wow.

520
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,775
Technically,
that's a fancy step out

521
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,802
surrounded by
miniature brilliant.

522
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,735
I wish we could've
gone to Europe.

523
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,807
Yeah.

524
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,455
Yeah, we'll go as
a family next time.

525
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,815
But you didn't
miss much, really.

526
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,975
We just stayed in the hotel room

527
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,495
the whole time
playing video games.

528
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
Really?

529
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,055
And the hotels are really
small and really old.

530
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,135
Squeaky.

531
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,415
Can I get you anything else?

532
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,771
Would you like to see
a dessert menu?

533
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,015
Listen, I told you
to put that away.

534
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,655
Would you put that
in your purse, please?

535
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,002
Computer games at the table. Yes,
please, another bottle of wine.

536
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,091
- Um, Coke.
- Um, you know what?

537
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,015
Mason, you're okay with water.

538
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,895
No more Cokes.
Thank you.

539
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,095
And how about you? Did
you finish your science project?

540
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,043
Not quite yet.

541
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,041
Well, did you work on it? Did you
build anything or plan anything or...

542
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,444
A little. Did he work
on it at all, Mindy?

543
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,801
No.

544
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,855
Did he sit around playing video
games with Mason the whole time?

545
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,211
Yeah.

546
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,335
You were supposed to finish
that by the time I got back.

547
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,407
Remember?

548
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,241
Hey.

549
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,215
Grievous is the best, man.

550
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,055
Yoda!
No, Yoda is, man!

551
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,375
Yoda! Yoda, man.

552
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,575
He has four arms.

553
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,215
Yoda, represent!

554
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,403
I hate Miss Burnsby. Everybody's
been saying she's lesbian.

555
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,922
She is. She hit on Stacey.

556
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,975
Man, that's gross.

557
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,135
Think it's true?

558
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,686
She's always walking
in the locker room.

559
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
I think I still have
a couple of those...

560
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,922
Hey, Paul, tell us a joke.

561
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,521
Damn. Fuck.
Go to hell. Ass.

562
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,575
Blew you up.

563
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,648
Heck, man.
That was not fair.

564
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,815
No, actually it was.

565
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,444
That's, like,
the fairest thing ever.

566
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,971
Where are you?

567
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,487
Once again, I take you down.

568
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,935
<i>The Mask?</i>

569
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,485
<i>Three Musketeers?</i>

570
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,365
First word.

571
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,855
- Chicken. Bird.
- Chicken. Bird.

572
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,881
Second word.

573
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,169
Hood. Big hair. <i>Robin Hood!</i>

574
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
- Whoo!
- Brilliant child!

575
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,446
Second word.

576
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,767
Blanket?

577
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
Hey, you can't use props!

578
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,655
Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,975
Cut it out. Judges speak.
No props. No props.

580
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,129
Can't use props. You can do it
without that. Think, think, think.

581
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,735
- Um, folding.
- Bunch!

582
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,695
The Gathered? Folded.
Is it like... Um...

583
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,495
It's just messing around
with a blanket. Wrinkling it...

584
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,695
<i>A Wrinkle In Time!</i>
Wrinkle.

585
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,165
Whoo!

586
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,415
What are the guards of Azkaban?

587
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,771
Dementors.

588
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,528
<i>Front of the fine,
are you ready?</i>

589
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,211
<i>Countdown with me, ladies
and gentlemen. Ten!</i>

590
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,695
<i>Nine! Eight! Seven!</i>

591
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,015
<i>Six! Five! Four!</i>

592
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,015
<i>Three! Two! One!</i>

593
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,375
<i>Let's go!</i>

594
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,401
<i>Whoo!</i>

595
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,165
Thank you.

596
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,601
Thanks.

597
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,015
All righty. Here we go.

598
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,855
No, no, no. Back up and take a
practice swing first, remember?

599
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,815
Nice and easy. Sweep the floor.
Sweep the floor.

600
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,365
That's good.

601
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,815
Don't swing too hard, Randy.

602
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,410
He always swings too hard.

603
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,764
Hey! All right!
Very good!

604
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,775
Back your feet up a little bit.
Yeah, like that.

605
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,450
Now you're gonna hit
it straighter. Okay.

606
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,055
All right, go up
and hit it. That's good.

607
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,809
Nice slow swing is
gonna be better for you.

608
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,611
All right!

609
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,495
I don't know, man,
you must've been...

610
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,575
See, your feet
are too open, Randy.

611
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,602
Nice and natural.

612
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,095
Yes! Go! All right!

613
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,415
Give me five! Good
putt, son, good putt.

614
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,615
Did you see that, Randy?
That's the way to do it!

615
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,926
All right.

616
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,207
Birdie putt.

617
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,762
God damn it.
Son of a bitch.

618
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,528
Get my clubs, would you?
Get the ball.

619
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,969
This is just in case we
have guests this weekend.

620
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,130
He always says that,
but we never have guests.

621
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,295
Samantha, I think
I heard your dad pull up.

622
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,375
All right.

623
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,890
You guys finish your chores?

624
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,411
Not quite.

625
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,210
Just about.

626
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,935
How about the dusting, Sam?

627
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,610
I haven't done that yet.

628
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,604
Well, I saw you working
on your art project.

629
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,775
You had time to finish
your little art project,

630
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,529
but you didn't have time
to finish your chores?

631
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,775
I thought we talked about that.

632
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,335
Dad, it's fine,
I can finish the dusting.

633
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,455
No, it's not fine, Mindy.

634
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,055
You have your own chores to
do and Sam has hers to do.

635
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,844
It's simple.

636
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,731
Poor choice there, Sam.
And hurry up.

637
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,561
Mason!

638
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,970
Your dad's here.

639
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,215
You guys aren't setting
any speed records, are you?

640
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,641
What'd you do, get about half done?
Hey, hey, hey.

641
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,335
So, did you finish?

642
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,361
No.

643
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,049
Is the job complete?

644
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,486
So, what are you
gonna be doing tomorrow?

645
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,681
Same thing, right?

646
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,564
Yeah.
Okay. Go.

647
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,975
Bye, Mom.

648
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,047
Bye, babe, I love you.

649
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,895
Bye, Mama.

650
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,935
Bye, honey.
Have fun with your dad.

651
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,450
Just a minute, Mason.

652
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,535
The boys didn't
finish raking leaves.

653
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,562
Samantha did not finish dusting.

654
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,895
So tomorrow,
when they come home,

655
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,215
instead of swimming
and all the other

656
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,455
little stuff that
they want to do,

657
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,655
they're going to do
their chores. Right?

658
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,735
Right.

659
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,255
Okay, guys,
you had this conversation,

660
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,486
you understand?
Tomorrow?

661
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,081
Okay.

662
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,095
Thank you. I just wanted
you to back me up on that

663
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,175
so I'm not the only one
yelling at them all the time.

664
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,202
Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?

665
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,415
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores?

666
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,966
They don't hear it. Goes in
one ear and out the other.

667
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,255
But, Dad, I mean,
dusting is pointless.

668
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,203
It's not pointless,
you just don't like to do it.

669
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,842
But, I mean, who dusts anymore?

670
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,048
You do when we ask you to!

671
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,455
And don't... Olivia, don't
let her back talk me

672
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,295
in front of the other kids,
please. Thank you.

673
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,481
Samantha, please.

674
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,655
Whatever!

675
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,935
Bye-bye.
Have a wonderful weekend.

676
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,121
Sam...

677
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,448
Okay. Bye, guys. Love you.

678
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,055
I'm sorry, but I thought
we talked about it.

679
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,015
You have to draw a line,
you have to back it up.

680
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,566
Okay. It's just you have
so many lines, Bill.

681
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,975
Everything's a line.

682
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,055
Hey, Randy!
Hey.

683
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,375
Bye.
Bye.

684
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,455
Hey, you two.
How you doing?

685
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,925
Shotgun.

686
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,335
Here, let me get
these bags here.

687
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,495
You doing okay, darling?

688
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,851
Yeah.
Yeah?

689
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,495
What about you, cowboy?
Pretty good.

690
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,965
Yeah?

691
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,524
All right. Let's roll!

692
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,050
You guys ready for the big game?

693
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,695
Yeah.

694
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,655
Sam, who are the Astros
playing tonight?

695
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,775
I don't know.

696
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,455
The Milwaukee Brewers,
all right?

697
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
Get to know 'em,
get to hate 'em.

698
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,575
Mason. How you been?
How was your week?

699
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,647
Pretty good.

700
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,285
Yeah? What you been up to?

701
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,335
Not much.
No?

702
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,695
You still hanging
with that kid Joe?

703
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,449
Yeah. And he's still
your best friend?

704
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,921
Yeah, I guess.

705
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,775
Okay.

706
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,095
How about you?
How was your week?

707
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,175
Fine.

708
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,775
What you been up to?

709
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,801
Nothing, really.

710
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,935
You, um, still working on
that sculpture project?

711
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,015
Yeah. Almost finished.
Yeah?

712
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,041
What's it of?

713
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,647
Nothing.

714
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,415
All right, no, no, no.

715
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,215
No, that is not how we are going
to talk to one another. All right?

716
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,165
No, I will not be that guy. You cannot
put me in that category, all right?

717
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,535
"The biological father that I
spend every other week with,"

718
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,335
"and I make polite conversation"

719
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,455
"while he drives me places
and buys me shit."

720
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,528
No! Talk to me.

721
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,375
Samantha, how was your week?

722
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,295
"I don't know, Dad,
it was kinda tough."

723
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,215
"Billy and Ellen broke up,
and Ellen's kinda mad at me,"

724
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,368
"'cause she saw me talking
to Billy in the cafeteria."

725
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,895
"And you remember that
sculpture I was working on,"

726
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,255
"well, it was a unicorn,"

727
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,250
"and the horn broke off,
so now it's a zebra," okay?

728
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,415
"But I still think I'm
gonna get an right?"

729
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,375
Mason, how was your week?

730
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,255
"Well, Dad, you know
it was kinda tough."

731
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,175
"Joey's kind of a jerk,
actually."

732
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,495
"He stole some cigarettes from his
mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em,"

733
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,935
"but I said no because I knew"

734
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,895
"what a hard time you had
quitting smoking, Dad."

735
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,815
How 'bout that?
Is that so hard?

736
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,775
Dad, these questions
are kind of hard to answer.

737
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,770
What is so hard to answer about
what sculpture are you making?

738
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,291
It's abstract.

739
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,255
Okay. Okay, that's good.

740
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,935
See, I didn't know that.

741
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,247
I didn't know you were even
interested in abstract art.

742
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,255
I'm not.
They make us do it.

743
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,487
But, Dad,
why is it all on us, though?

744
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,655
What about you?
How was your week?

745
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,015
Who do you hang out with?

746
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,281
Do you have a girlfriend?
What have you been up to?

747
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,610
I see your point.

748
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,455
So we should just let it
happen more natural, right?

749
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,095
That's what you're saying?

750
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,255
Okay, that's what we'll do.

751
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,361
Starting now.

752
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,090
Check this out.

753
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,564
That would be a...

754
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,287
That would be a Magnificent Owl.
<i>Caligo atreus.</i>

755
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,055
- What's that one? Look at this.
- Whoa!

756
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,135
What kind is that?

757
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,686
That looks like a Zebra Longwing.
All right.

758
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,895
Cool.

759
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,855
This one's incredible.
That's the owl one, right?

760
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,326
Yeah.
Magnificent Owl.

761
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,807
I think he went
pee-pee on you, bud.

762
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,848
One, two, three, four, five.

763
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,007
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

764
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,569
Yo, Mase, look at me here. Make a
diamond with your hands, all right?

765
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,455
Fingers and thumbs.

766
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,925
Keep your hands soft.

767
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,846
Sam. Very nice.

768
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,175
That's how you want to
catch it, just like that.

769
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,255
Even when you're running,

770
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,884
that's what you're thinking
about, that diamond.

771
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,055
That diamond and soft hands.

772
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,445
There it is.

773
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,405
No, no, no.

774
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,135
No!
Yes!

775
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,242
Don't let her get...
No, no, no!

776
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,610
Let's go, Roger!

777
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,568
That's it, Roger!
Yeah!

778
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,610
Guy's incredible.
He's unhittable this year.

779
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,695
Now, just so you know, what
we're watching here is history.

780
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,960
Now, you see this guy out here?

781
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,895
This dude is like 43 years old,

782
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,095
and he's striking out
guys half his age.

783
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,603
This guy's ERA is 1.47, all right?
Can you believe that?

784
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,162
Now, if the Astros could just get a
few runs, maybe we'd win a game.

785
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,963
Dad, do you have a job?

786
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,775
Why would you ask me that?

787
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,175
I don't know.
Mom wanted to know,

788
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,095
and I didn't know what the answer was.
Mom wanted to know.

789
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,935
All right.
Well, you can tell Mom

790
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,530
that I just happen
to have passed

791
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,484
my second actuarial exam,
all right?

792
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,015
So, tell her that.
How's she doing?

793
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,095
Is she finishing school?

794
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,121
Yep, all A's.

795
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,244
All A's? Like mother,
like daughter, right?

796
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,815
He got that!
That's out...

797
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,855
Yeah! Look at that!

798
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,415
Yeah!

799
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,849
Mason! Yes!

800
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,850
Whoo!

801
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,846
Yeah!

802
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,841
Yeah!

803
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,526
Whoo!

804
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,055
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Samantha!

805
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,255
Hey. What's up, Jimmy?

806
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,851
What's going on, Mason, man?

807
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,495
Astros won.

808
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,855
You went to the game?

809
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,175
What, I'm the only one
with any arms around here?

810
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,884
Nobody else can carry anything?

811
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,215
Help their old man out?

812
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,685
What you watching?

813
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,129
Come on, Jimmy, man! You knew
the kids were coming this weekend.

814
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,175
Can't you just help
me out a little bit?

815
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,486
I'm sorry, muffin.

816
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,975
Yeah, don't
"muffin" me, all right?

817
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,200
Don't put me in that position.

818
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,601
I'm not your fuckin'
Tony Randall.

819
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,006
Dad, it's always a mess.

820
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,771
It was not a mess
this morning. Okay?

821
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,695
I mowed the lawn.

822
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,563
Yeah? Great.

823
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,175
Come on, man!
Turn this shit off.

824
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,362
Come on, give me that thing.

825
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,775
Did you watch the game?
No.

826
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,535
Lane won it
with a three-run homer.

827
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,289
It was beautiful, wasn't it?

828
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,135
Sam lost her mind.

829
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,764
She's a huge Astros fan.

830
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,241
Sure.

831
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,129
<i>Saturday night
was a lunar eclipse</i>

832
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,411
<i>I sang 'em a song
Went something like this</i>

833
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,523
<i>Well, go to sleep,
my weary babies</i>

834
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,642
<i>Let the sounds roll on by</i>

835
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,482
<i>Tonight we're safe
here in Houston</i>

836
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,962
<i>With this, your daddy's lullaby</i>

837
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,487
<i>Your mother's got
a new husband now</i>

838
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,281
<i>He seems all right</i>

839
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,684
<i>I wonder if he's
reading them stories</i>

840
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,051
<i>And kissing them good night</i>

841
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,808
<i>Well, babysitters say
they miss me</i>

842
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,646
<i>I know
I shouldn't hope it's true</i>

843
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,935
<i>Teacher says my son
paints pictures of a family</i>

844
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,201
<i>All in blue</i>

845
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,569
<i>She says she caught him
whispering to the window</i>

846
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,370
<i>Will Daddy please come home?</i>

847
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,246
<i>I know I could call him up</i>

848
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,329
<i>But what if his mother
answers the phone?</i>

849
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,242
You brush your teeth?
What?

850
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,815
Did you brush your teeth?

851
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,320
Yeah. Yeah.

852
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,975
You gonna fall asleep with
those things in your head?

853
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,001
Maybe.

854
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,335
Yeah, well, try not to, all right?
Okay.

855
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,362
Want me to turn off the light?
Okay. Sure.

856
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,487
Good night, Sam.
Night, Dad.

857
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,961
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Jimmy.

858
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,050
Hey. That was
a fun day, right?

859
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,009
Yeah, it was. Sorry.

860
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,442
Why? That Mason had to
be there, you know.

861
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,122
Good night.
Good night.

862
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,480
Dad?

863
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,763
There's no, like, real
magic in the world, right?

864
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,450
What do you mean?

865
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,004
You know, like elves and stuff.

866
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,569
People just made that up.

867
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,131
I don't know.

868
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,415
I mean, what makes you think
that elves are any more magical

869
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,442
than something like a whale?

870
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,375
You know what I mean? What
if I told you a story about

871
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,615
how underneath the ocean,

872
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,655
there was this giant sea mammal

873
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,615
that used sonar and sang songs

874
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,535
and it was so big that its
heart was the size of a car

875
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,370
and you could crawl
through the arteries?

876
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,015
I mean, you'd think that
was pretty magical, right?

877
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,405
Yeah.

878
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,975
But, like, right this second,

879
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,085
there's, like, no elves
in the world, right?

880
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,451
No. Technically,
no elves.

881
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,848
Love you, guys. All right.
Be well. See you, Dad.

882
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,335
Have a great week. Sam,
I'll see you next weekend?

883
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,095
All right. Yeah, that's right.
What?

884
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,175
Suzy has a birthday party
next Saturday.

885
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,255
A sleepover?
Yeah.

886
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,095
All right. I'll talk
to your mom about it.

887
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,335
Bye, Dad.
Don't worry about it, okay?

888
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,283
Have a great week. Okay.
Had a great time.

889
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,800
How do you guys not know how to do this?

890
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,043
I'll make you some bookmarks.
Just a second. Pictures...

891
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,324
She looks nice.

892
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,368
Randy, Mason, Dad wants
you guys downstairs.

893
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,521
Why?
You're getting haircuts.

894
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,680
This is gonna
look so much better.

895
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,883
You're gonna look like a man,
instead of like a little girl.

896
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,724
You're taking the eyebrows
off next, right, Byron?

897
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,963
Mason, we're leaving.

898
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,850
You're not sick.

899
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,208
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.

900
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,560
Where's Mason?

901
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,855
He doesn't feel too good. I don't
think he's going to school.

902
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,281
He's totally faking it.

903
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,926
Bye.

904
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,642
Mason, what's going on?

905
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,895
I don't feel good.

906
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,175
Yeah, well,
your head feels fine.

907
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,645
So get your ass out of bed.

908
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,895
I'm gonna drive you to school.

909
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,571
You got five minutes,
and don't make me late.

910
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,048
I mean, he didn't even ask!
He just cut it.

911
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,125
It's my hair!

912
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,520
Well, no wonder you were angry.
I'd be angry, too.

913
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,522
I look like a Martian now.

914
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,328
Honey, you know what? I'm gonna
talk to him about it later. Okay?

915
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,649
Yeah, I tried to call you, but
you didn't answer your phone.

916
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,883
I'm so sorry. I've been
so busy with school.

917
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,887
For what it's worth, it's
hair and it will grow back.

918
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,485
And now I can see your pretty
eyes and your foxy face.

919
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,095
Why did you even marry him?

920
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,201
He's such a jerk!

921
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,086
Well, Bill has
his good qualities.

922
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,285
You know, nobody's perfect.
And now we have a family.

923
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,050
We already had a family.

924
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,295
I pledge allegiance to the flag

925
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,215
of the United States
of America...

926
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,449
...and to the
Republic for which it stands,

927
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,815
one nation, under God,

928
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,775
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

929
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,531
Please join me
in the Texas Pledge.

930
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,975
Honor the Texas flag.

931
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,526
I pledge allegiance to thee,

932
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,371
Texas one and indivisible.

933
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,255
Thank you.
You may be seated.

934
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,925
All right.

935
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,335
All right, class, as you know,

936
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,575
we've been working on
our mythology projects,

937
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,375
and you're going to be writing
papers about gods and goddesses.

938
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,095
We've listed those gods and
goddesses here on the board.

939
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,575
We added a couple of monsters

940
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,935
for some of you who might
be interested in that.

941
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,375
And you're going to write your
essay about your god and goddess,

942
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,175
and to make sure that
you cover everything,

943
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,775
let's make sure that we do all
of these things right here.

944
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,282
First of all, you need to name
your god or goddess,

945
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,530
and you need to include who,
what, when, where, why and how.

946
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,535
So make sure that
you cover all those things

947
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,244
when you're writing your essay.

948
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,568
There's a bump right there.

949
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,335
I'll see you later, guys.

950
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,486
Yeah.

951
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,815
- Mom, are you okay?
- What happened?

952
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,895
No.

953
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,415
Go in the house! Go! Go in the house!
Go in the house!

954
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,011
Your mother
had a little accident.

955
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,215
Now she's being dramatic.

956
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,047
Get off the fucking
floor, Olivia. For Christ's sake!

957
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,843
I'm having a drink
with my dinner.

958
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,366
Anybody else have
a problem with that?

959
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,883
Samantha?
No.

960
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,535
Mindy?

961
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,561
No.

962
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,887
I didn't think so.

963
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,400
You don't like me
much, do you, Mason?

964
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,562
That's okay. I don't like me either.

965
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,204
You think that's funny?

966
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,640
You think that's fuckin' funny?

967
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,175
What's the matter, you
feeling a little left out?

968
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,855
Clean it up, God damn it!
Clean it up.

969
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,455
Bill! Clean it up, God damn it!

970
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,970
I hate squash!

971
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,135
<i>Pearl.</i>

972
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,735
<i>I'm gonna pay you.</i>

973
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,135
<i>I'm working
three jobs right now.</i>

974
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,640
How many times can
you watch that, Mason?

975
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,809
It's funny.
<i>I'm driving a cab.</i>

976
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,215
<i>I'm inside with my buddy right
now just going over my résumé.</i>

977
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,288
<i>Okay, you know what?
You need to relax.</i>

978
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,775
<i>Look, why do you need your
money so fast? Come on.</i>

979
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,695
- Has he ever gotten this bad before?
- No.

980
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,415
But he's yelled a lot.

981
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,410
Yeah, but he hasn't
thrown and broken stuff.

982
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,400
<i>Yeah.
You're drunk. I knew it.</i>

983
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,089
<i>You're already drunk.</i>

984
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,402
Give me your cell phones.

985
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,762
So nobody talked to her?

986
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,087
Mason?

987
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,121
No.

988
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,255
Mindy?
No.

989
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,281
I believe you.

990
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,015
Samantha?

991
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,041
No.

992
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,042
I didn't talk to her.
She left a message.

993
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,447
What'd she say?

994
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,201
Nothing much.

995
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,565
What did she say?

996
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,210
She said she'd be back later.

997
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,848
And that's all,
"I'll be back later," click?

998
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,495
She said, "Stay in your rooms.
I'll be back later."

999
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,569
I'll be back later, stay in your rooms.
And that's all?

1000
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,975
Yeah.

1001
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,047
Where is she?

1002
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,855
I don't know.
Where is she?

1003
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,881
She didn't say!

1004
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,366
All right. Everybody,
get in the car.

1005
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,642
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

1006
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,135
It's still not working.

1007
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,241
Bullshit.

1008
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,205
She took it all.

1009
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,921
All right, Randy, go cash this.

1010
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,121
Tell them I'm not feeling well
or something. I don't know.

1011
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,204
Mason, go with him.

1012
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,561
Here. There's my ID.

1013
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,731
Hi, good afternoon, fellas.
What can I do for you today?

1014
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,927
Now what's this?

1015
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,615
Can't read this.

1016
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,766
Hey!

1017
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,440
This isn't you!
Who is this?

1018
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,765
It's our dad.

1019
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,129
He's not feeling well.

1020
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,402
Hey! Yeah, I know him.
Okay, here we go.

1021
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,935
Five hundred bucks.

1022
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,611
One, two, three, four...

1023
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,920
Five hundred bucks.
All right?

1024
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,408
Don't forget your dad's ID.

1025
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,888
Now take care of your dad now, son.
You only got the one.

1026
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,046
Damn it.

1027
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,610
Get outta the way.
Jesus Christ.

1028
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,366
God...

1029
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,245
Calm down!

1030
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,367
Samantha! Mason!

1031
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,167
Samantha!

1032
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,295
Where the hell have you been?

1033
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,880
I'm leaving you, Bill.
We're moving out.

1034
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,775
I doubt that.

1035
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,375
Samantha, Mason!
Come down!

1036
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,335
No, don't think so.
Who's this?

1037
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,040
- I'm not here for you!
- Really?

1038
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,408
I know, you're here
to protect my wife from me.

1039
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,000
Well, thank you so much, you two.
Okay, stay back!

1040
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,615
Why don't you come inside here?
Come inside here.

1041
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,095
Where the hell are you going?

1042
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,175
Get your ass upstairs!
You're not going anywhere.

1043
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,770
Stop! Come on!

1044
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,135
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Get upstairs!

1045
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,695
What the hell... Nobody's
going anywhere, God damn it!

1046
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,370
No, God damn it!
Stop it.

1047
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,655
Don't touch my kids!

1048
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,975
All right, take 'em.
Go on, go on.

1049
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,200
- Don't touch them!
- Take 'em.

1050
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,295
Take 'em then, just take 'em!
Get in the car.

1051
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,367
Go!

1052
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,005
Get upstairs! Olivia!

1053
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,686
Seat belts! Put your seat belts on.

1054
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,646
Where are we going?

1055
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,604
We're going to stay with Carol
and her family for a while.

1056
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,044
Don't look back.

1057
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,164
It's gonna be okay.

1058
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,455
<i>And we see that</i>

1059
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,643
<i>We're all in this together</i>

1060
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,963
<i>And it shows
When we stand hand in hand</i>

1061
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,735
Hey, Lee and Mason.
Guys, when you want

1062
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,728
to take a break, here's a snack.

1063
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,215
<i>...going on...</i>

1064
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,495
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it loud</i>

1065
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,335
<i>Wildcats everywhere</i>

1066
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,964
<i>Wave your hands up in the air</i>

1067
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,289
Abby, why don't you
come and help me with this?

1068
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,244
Why couldn't Randy
and Mindy come with us?

1069
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,895
I'm not their
legal guardian, honey.

1070
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,215
That would be kidnapping.
I can't just...

1071
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,895
What's gonna happen to them?

1072
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,295
What happens when their legal
guardian is dangerous and abusive?

1073
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,055
I don't know, honey.

1074
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,289
I called their mom. I called
the Child Protective Services.

1075
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,135
I have you and your brother.

1076
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,735
We are in a dangerous situation.

1077
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,524
You're my responsibility.

1078
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,248
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

1079
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,055
I don't know.

1080
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,320
I hope so.

1081
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,840
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

1082
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,570
Not long. We're...

1083
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,971
I don't...

1084
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,128
I don't know. I don't
have the answer, baby.

1085
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,975
Listen.

1086
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,810
We are happy to have you
here as long as you want.

1087
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,404
As long as you need.

1088
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,881
This is fun for us, isn't it?

1089
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah, it's like
having a big sister?

1090
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,695
Like having a brother.

1091
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,175
We're gonna help out, right?

1092
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,735
You're not even gonna
know we're here.

1093
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,205
Okay.

1094
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,095
Mom, this is awful.

1095
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,855
You're dumping me in some
parking lot of this school

1096
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,370
where I don't even know anyone!

1097
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,975
I'm leaving all my friends, and I
didn't even get to say goodbye!

1098
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,365
I don't know where to go!

1099
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,015
Samantha, you go
right through that door.

1100
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,975
The office is right there.
They're expecting you.

1101
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,135
They're gonna give you
your schedule.

1102
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,375
Here's your lunch money.

1103
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,085
I will pick you up
right here at 3:30.

1104
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,207
I'm wearing dirty clothes because you
wouldn't even let us get our stuff!

1105
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,850
We don't even have
a place to live!

1106
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,361
This sucks!

1107
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,127
Samantha, I'm doing
the best I can!

1108
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,335
And you're right, it sucks!

1109
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,603
But it doesn't suck half as
much as having a drunk fool

1110
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,370
slam your head against a wall!

1111
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,815
So out your horseshit attitude!

1112
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,729
Put your seat belt on!

1113
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,735
You know, if you need anything,
I'm in Room 112, right?

1114
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,761
Okay.

1115
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,008
This is Mrs. Darby's room.

1116
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,015
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

1117
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,166
Mom.

1118
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,442
Dude, did you see that?

1119
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,415
That concert was awful.

1120
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,081
Hook, I mean, when he smashed that
board against that microphone...

1121
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,975
Are you Mason?
Yeah.

1122
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,935
Hi, I'm Mrs. Darby.
I'm glad to meet you.

1123
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,883
Why don't you sit here?

1124
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,735
Kenny! Off.

1125
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,761
Yes, ma'am.

1126
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,255
Kenny, this is Mason,

1127
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,089
and I want you to show
him around today, okay?

1128
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,805
Got it.

1129
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,041
Hey, dude.
Welcome to the suck.

1130
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,562
Everybody, listen up!

1131
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,455
We have a new student
joining us today.

1132
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,448
His name is Mason,
he's sitting in the back row.

1133
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,735
Kenny's going to be his buddy,
but I want each one of you

1134
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,001
to take the time today
to introduce yourselves

1135
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,010
and welcome him
to school. Okay?

1136
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,687
All right?
Let's get started.

1137
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,726
What?

1138
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,961
Hi.

1139
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,775
Can I put an Obama sign
in your yard?

1140
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,849
Do I look like a Barack
Hussein Obama supporter?

1141
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,127
No.

1142
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,215
This is private property.
Get off.

1143
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,295
I could shoot you!

1144
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,855
What a dick.

1145
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,928
He had a Confederate flag
on his house.

1146
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,481
I love it.

1147
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,171
Young Obama supporters out
on the trail, this is great!

1148
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,175
Are you doing this
through your school?

1149
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,770
Um, our dad's a big supporter.

1150
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,135
That's great.

1151
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,975
I mean, we have just got to pull
together to get this win, right?

1152
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,055
Yeah.

1153
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,162
I just love him so much!

1154
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,975
I have these dreams
where I'm just kissing him,

1155
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,335
'cause I just love him so much!

1156
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,695
He's so cute, isn't he?

1157
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,960
Yeah.

1158
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,135
You know, I made these
T-shirts for my kids.

1159
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,924
"My Mama's For Obama."

1160
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,055
Do you like it?
Yeah.

1161
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,815
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

1162
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,047
- Thanks for the sign!
- No problem.

1163
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,449
All right! Looks good!

1164
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,655
How many you got left, two?

1165
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,375
All right, all right, we're done.
Let's get out of here.

1166
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,855
Come on, Sam.

1167
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,041
Go get that McCain sign,
would you?

1168
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,403
What? Get the McCain sign.
Go rip it up, come on.

1169
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,040
Get it, get it, get it,
go. go, go!

1170
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,170
Good job, good job.
Proud of you, son.

1171
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,255
You guys
are gonna get us arrested.

1172
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,575
Look, I'm a patriot, all right?

1173
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,251
And sometimes in this life
you gotta fight.

1174
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,087
And what is it that you do
at these parties?

1175
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,455
I don't know. Talk,
dance, listen to music.

1176
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,895
And that's more fun
to you than going camping

1177
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,575
with your brother and
your father who love you.

1178
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,080
Yes. Sorry.

1179
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,765
Wow. Is there gonna
be alcohol there?

1180
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,080
Probably not.

1181
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,921
Maybe some of the seniors.

1182
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,615
I know what this party is.

1183
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,975
The parents are
out of town, right?

1184
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,055
Somebody's scored a keg, right?

1185
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,735
You guys are gonna have a good
time, trash the whole house.

1186
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,895
Right? Am I right?
No.

1187
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,161
No, Dad.
Amy's really responsible.

1188
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,606
Who's gonna be there?

1189
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,687
Marie, Christine, Amy.
Everyone.

1190
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,810
Is that guy on your Facebook
page, is he gonna be there?

1191
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,575
Who?

1192
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,455
Come on, the guy that's got
his arm wrapped around you,

1193
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,095
with his hair over his eyes.

1194
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,255
Garret?

1195
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,335
Garret. Is that his name?
All right.

1196
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,495
Is Garret gonna be there?

1197
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,601
Probably.

1198
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,010
Probably.
You see?

1199
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,415
I learn more about her
from her Facebook page

1200
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,335
than I do from our
scintillating conversation.

1201
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,486
Is he your boyfriend?

1202
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,641
Kind of.

1203
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,495
Have you met him? Has he
been around the house?

1204
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,615
Sometimes.

1205
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,324
Sometimes? Zzz?

1206
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,331
You have a boyfriend!

1207
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,201
Wow.

1208
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,815
Have you heard of Sarah Palin?

1209
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,295
Yes.

1210
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,735
What's the one thing
you know about

1211
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,120
Sarah Palin's
17-year-old daughter?

1212
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,770
She's pregnant?
That's right.

1213
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,655
And what is the one thing
that you are not going to be

1214
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,921
in a couple of years
when you turn 17?

1215
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,722
Pregnant?
That's right!

1216
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,524
All right, now,
what are the two ways

1217
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,926
that you can achieve that goal?

1218
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,366
First is

1219
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,409
not have any sex, okay?

1220
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,895
That's the first way, okay?
Just not engage in that.

1221
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,207
That did not work out very
well for your mother and me.

1222
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,250
And what's the second way?

1223
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,535
Where you going?
Bathroom.

1224
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,655
You don't have to go
to the bathroom.

1225
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,126
Sit down, Mason, just sit down.

1226
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,601
What's the second way?

1227
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,095
Has your mother talked to
you guys about this stuff?

1228
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,175
No, Dad!

1229
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,760
No, come on, has she
talked to you about

1230
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,051
contraception?

1231
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,415
What, has she...
Condoms?

1232
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,335
She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.

1233
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,521
What?

1234
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,211
Does Garret have a condom?
God!

1235
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,855
Dad! What? Come on.

1236
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,895
Sam, we have to be able to
talk about this, all right?

1237
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,735
Come on, we do. We can
do it, we can do it.

1238
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,375
Just stay with me here,
all right?

1239
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,175
It's as hard for me as it is for you.
But seriously, all right?

1240
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,735
I read an article in the paper
the other day that said

1241
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,095
that although US teenagers are
not the most sexually active,

1242
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,681
we have the highest rate
of teenage pregnancy, okay?

1243
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,081
Hey.

1244
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,855
Hey, Tammy, how you doing?
What's going on?

1245
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,847
Nice to see you.

1246
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,575
Yeah, good to see you. Yeah.

1247
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,615
Um, Tammy, this is my
daughter Samantha. Hey.

1248
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,369
And this is,
Mason Junior right here.

1249
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,695
- Mason Junior.
- Tammy.

1250
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,735
Say hi.
Hi.

1251
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,735
Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you guys.

1252
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,375
What're you doing here?

1253
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,895
I'm just here with some friends.

1254
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,895
Wow.
Yeah.

1255
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,015
What are you guys up to?

1256
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,215
Um, we're going camping.

1257
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,255
Well, no, this one
is not going camping.

1258
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,815
This one is going to a party.

1259
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,410
Fun.

1260
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,364
But we, the men,
are going camping.

1261
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,775
The boys are going camping.

1262
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,245
All right, very nice.

1263
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,055
Well, we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1264
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,095
No, I'll drop him off at 7:00
and then I'll just call you.

1265
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,167
Okay.
Right?

1266
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,415
Great. It was really
nice meeting you both.

1267
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,441
Take care.

1268
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,768
Talk to you soon. Bye. I'll see you.
I'll see you.

1269
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,615
Don't look at me
like that, all right?

1270
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,961
Look, just to finish
the point, okay?

1271
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,615
I was 23 when your mom had you, all right?
So was she.

1272
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,895
All right, and we didn't
put ourselves

1273
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,844
in the best position
to be great parents.

1274
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,804
And I wish that...

1275
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,335
I wish I were a better parent
to you guys, all right?

1276
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,295
And I hope that you
can learn from my mistakes, okay?

1277
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,775
All right. So wear a condom, okay?

1278
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,135
Or get Garret to...

1279
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,286
I don't know, whatever.

1280
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,842
Listen to this song, all right?

1281
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,807
<i>I try to stay busy</i>

1282
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,375
Just straight-up...
The lyrics in this,

1283
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,084
straight-up
old-school country song.

1284
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,811
<i>I do the dishes I mow the lawn</i>

1285
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,895
Listen to
the production of this.

1286
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,764
Production's like
<i>Abbey Road</i> or something.

1287
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,455
<i>Even though I know
You're not coming home</i>

1288
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,815
You know, his old woman's gone.

1289
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,895
Straight-up.
Nothing fancy.

1290
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,526
<i>I try to keep
the house nice and neat</i>

1291
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,964
<i>Make my bed I change the sheets</i>

1292
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,407
<i>I even learned how to use
the washing machine</i>

1293
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,851
<i>Keeping things clean
Doesn't change anything</i>

1294
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,335
Yeah, I think she's about
to get her master's degree.

1295
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,335
Well, then she's gonna start
applying for teaching jobs?

1296
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,655
I think she already has.

1297
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,935
Really? Where?

1298
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,086
All over.

1299
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,615
All over Texas?
Yeah.

1300
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,335
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
move, you know? It's no big deal.

1301
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,364
We can handle that. I'll still
come get you every other weekend.

1302
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,895
I mean, unless she moves
500 miles away or something,

1303
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,535
it'll just be a little bit
more car time.

1304
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,855
No big deal.

1305
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,215
I'm just kind of sick of moving.

1306
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,735
Well, I bet you are.

1307
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,815
But, you know, you never know.

1308
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,375
I might have
to move. Right?

1309
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,375
I'm working for this
insurance company now.

1310
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,615
These places get bought
and sold all the time.

1311
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,086
You know,
we'll just roll with it.

1312
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,615
I thought you were a musician.

1313
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,766
I am,

1314
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,926
but life is expensive, you know?

1315
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,615
Guy's got to be responsible.

1316
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,815
What do you think?

1317
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,046
Hey! Hey!

1318
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,055
You!

1319
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,560
Punk kid!
You got no respect!

1320
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,095
You know that redhead
at the bowling alley?

1321
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,407
Sure.
What about her?

1322
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,935
Do you know her well?

1323
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,440
You know,
we've hung out a little bit.

1324
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,568
Is she your girlfriend?

1325
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,775
How do you mean?

1326
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,928
Like, have you kissed her?

1327
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,521
Um...

1328
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,368
Yeah. Yeah,
I've kissed her.

1329
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,888
What about you?
Have you got a girlfriend?

1330
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,286
Sort of.

1331
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,841
Really?

1332
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,962
Have you, kissed her?

1333
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,451
Not really.

1334
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,015
Yeah? What have you done?

1335
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,295
Well, we talked on the phone.

1336
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,415
Yeah!

1337
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,815
How did that go?

1338
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,935
Pretty terrible.

1339
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,281
Why?

1340
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,375
Well, when we're at school,
we got plenty to talk about,

1341
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,135
but when we're alone
or on the phone,

1342
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,935
it's like we have
nothing in common.

1343
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,166
Nothing?

1344
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,008
She's not interested in
music or video games or...

1345
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,415
Three best movies this summer.
Right.

1346
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,255
<i>Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight</i>
and <i>Pineapple Express.</i>

1347
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,175
Yeah, what about 'em?
She said they all sucked.

1348
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,043
Okay, what's she interested in?

1349
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,319
I don't know.

1350
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,775
Going to the mall with her
stupid friends?

1351
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,775
Well, is she cute?
Watch your step there.

1352
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,455
Yeah.
Yeah? All right.

1353
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,051
Well, here's what
you do, all right?

1354
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,655
First off, you gotta
ask her a lot of questions.

1355
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,575
Then you have to listen to
the answers, all right?

1356
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,135
Actually be interested
in her, all right?

1357
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,415
If you can do those things,

1358
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,250
you're gonna be light years
ahead of all the other guys.

1359
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,161
Okay. This is the best s'more I
ever made in my life, all right?

1360
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,495
This is absolute peak. Look at this.
Yeah. Yeah.

1361
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,815
Honey brown, no burn.

1362
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,960
Look at that?

1363
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,495
Sell that in the store.

1364
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,975
That's like advertisement worthy.

1365
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,295
Advertisement quality.

1366
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,401
Yeah.

1367
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,575
You think they ever will
make another <i>Star Wars?</i>

1368
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,815
I don't know. I think if they
were gonna make another one,

1369
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,535
that the period
where this game is set

1370
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,055
is where it would have to be,

1371
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,295
'cause there's
nothing after, really.

1372
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,655
Yeah. No, Return of the Jedi, it's over.
There's nothing...

1373
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,886
Yeah, there's nothing else
to do there.

1374
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,495
You gonna turn Han Solo into a Sith Lord?

1375
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,880
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
Right.

1376
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,523
Good morning.
Morning.

1377
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,255
You gotta pee?

1378
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,281
Sure.

1379
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,255
Hit the campfire.

1380
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,567
Ancient Native American custom.

1381
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,015
You're gonna give back to the
Earth what you take from it,

1382
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,247
and you don't burn
the forest down.

1383
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,281
Okay, guys, have a good day!

1384
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,935
Mason, don't forget,
I have to teach late today.

1385
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,644
Sam's gonna pick you up.
Right, Sam? Yeah.

1386
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,895
All right.
Okay. Bye, guys.

1387
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,160
See you.

1388
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,361
Hey.

1389
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,255
That's what I was
talking to you about.

1390
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,135
Yeah. Good luck with that.

1391
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,605
See you, man.

1392
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,165
Don't bump into me!
Little bitch!

1393
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,295
I didn't!

1394
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,775
You calling me a liar?

1395
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,801
No.

1396
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,448
Don't act like you're
tough shit, motherfucker.

1397
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,843
I don't think pretty boy's
hair's good enough.

1398
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,768
Don't touch me, faggot!

1399
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,164
You're a fuckin' asshole.

1400
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,415
<i>Hey, Mason!</i>

1401
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,487
<i>Hey, Jill.</i>

1402
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,295
So, where're you going?

1403
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,446
Over to the college.

1404
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,335
What's going on there?

1405
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,735
My mom's a teacher.

1406
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,366
Cool.
What does she teach?

1407
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,768
Psychology, I think.

1408
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,295
What're you up to?

1409
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,015
My mom owns Needleworks.

1410
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,769
The arts and crafts
store over there.

1411
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,495
So I'm just kinda hangin' out.

1412
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,455
But I'm supposed to be going
to the hospital soon.

1413
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,766
How come?

1414
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,844
You know Courtney?

1415
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,295
Girl with the dyed black hair
and the nose ring?

1416
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,695
Wears Hot Topic every day?

1417
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,210
I think so.

1418
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,055
We used to be
best friends growing up,

1419
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,923
but we've kind of grown apart.

1420
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,135
She sorta got all emo,
she thinks I'm a prep,

1421
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,015
but I still consider
her a friend.

1422
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,495
Anyway, she cut
one of her wrists.

1423
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,285
I don't know how bad, but I
think I should go visit.

1424
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,455
So what're you reading?

1425
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,563
It's <i>Breakfast of Champions.</i>
Kurt Vonnegut.

1426
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,726
I think my older brother
likes him.

1427
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,735
I'm reading <i>To Kill a
Mockingbird</i> for the third time.

1428
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,295
My friends make fun of me.

1429
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,175
I think I'm the only girl
in the whole school

1430
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,975
who doesn't like
the Twilight books.

1431
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,215
Have you read 'em?

1432
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,366
Sure haven't.

1433
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,135
I tried,

1434
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,844
but it was so cheesy!

1435
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,442
So, how do you like San Marcos?

1436
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,415
I like it all right.

1437
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,081
It's a lot smaller than Houston,
but it seems pretty cool.

1438
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,575
Have you always lived here?

1439
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,775
Yeah.

1440
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,175
If you want
the big city around here,

1441
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,655
you have to drive
to San Antonio or Austin.

1442
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,535
Have you been there yet?

1443
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,415
I went to San Antonio for a day,

1444
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,966
but I haven't been
to Austin yet.

1445
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,895
That's where all
the high school kids go

1446
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,763
on weekends for shows and stuff.

1447
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,735
That's what I've heard.

1448
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,808
So, are you going to
Shauna's party next weekend?

1449
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,015
Um, I think I heard about it.
I'm not really sure, though.

1450
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,175
Well, you should!

1451
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,440
Why's that?

1452
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,855
Well, LeeAnne has
a big crush on you,

1453
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,295
and I know she was
hoping you would go.

1454
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,255
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

1455
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,375
Not currently.

1456
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,015
Well then, you should come.

1457
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,615
I'll tell Chase to
make sure you're there.

1458
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,801
Okay.

1459
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,175
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.
She'd kill me.

1460
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,486
I won't.

1461
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,775
Well, I better get going.

1462
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,211
See you later.
Bye.

1463
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,083
His cognitive theories,
his interviews with orphans,

1464
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,615
ethology theorists' work,

1465
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,971
and then he in turn

1466
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,527
was supported strongly by Harry
Harlow's rhesus monkey study.

1467
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,615
Now, you guys, you gotta think,

1468
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,961
this is the 1950s,
this was radical!

1469
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,015
This flew in the face of
traditional learning theory,

1470
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,681
of B.F. Skinner's classical
and instrumental conditioning.

1471
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,887
Now, Bowlby's gonna argue that

1472
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,443
human survival depends
on us falling in love.

1473
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,327
It depends on me falling
in love with my mother

1474
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,415
and my mother
falling in love with me.

1475
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,522
And if that doesn't happen,

1476
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,965
we're pretty much doomed.

1477
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,775
Now think about it.

1478
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,724
A tiger chases her tribe
out of a cave

1479
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,846
Now, an ideal mother goes,

1480
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,735
"My baby! I love you,
I'll protect you!"

1481
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,685
Or, "Well, you, why am I gonna pick you up?
You're gonna slow me down."

1482
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,335
"You are
tiger kibble!"

1483
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,975
So, next week,
we are gonna get into

1484
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,446
Bowlby's four stages
of attachment.

1485
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,415
Professor Douglas and I...

1486
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,055
Some of you might
have classes with Elena.

1487
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,448
She and I are hosting a little
pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place,

1488
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,484
so if anyone wants to come,
please stop by.

1489
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,082
I'm not the greatest cook.

1490
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,200
Thanks.

1491
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,331
Samantha!

1492
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,855
Why the hell didn't you pick up your
brother like you said you would?

1493
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,803
Okay. Mom... Mom, I know
what you're gonna say.

1494
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,375
She was running late
and we couldn't turn around.

1495
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,695
No, no! No excuses!

1496
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,615
The bottom line is you didn't do
what you said you were gonna do!

1497
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,375
You stranded your brother!

1498
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,095
It's embarrassing to ask
my friend to turn around

1499
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,775
and go get some kid
at the middle school.

1500
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,768
What do you mean "some kid"?
He's your brother!

1501
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,528
And you know what? We've
helped Janey out before.

1502
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,255
She lives right around the corner.
It's no big deal.

1503
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,486
Sorry.

1504
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,495
You know what, Samantha?

1505
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,735
You need to start thinking long
and hard about who you wanna be.

1506
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,206
Do you wanna be
a cooperative person

1507
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,815
who's compassionate and
helps people out...

1508
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,735
...or do you wanna be
a self-centered narcissist?

1509
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,135
You know what? You're right.
I am this horrible person.

1510
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,735
But, honestly,
he's not a baby anymore.

1511
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,335
You don't have to
treat him like one.

1512
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,126
He's in eighth grade, and he can
find his way home if he wants to.

1513
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,455
You know what?

1514
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,404
When Gabi leaves, you and
me are gonna have a chat.

1515
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,766
Awkward.

1516
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,724
Dude, that sucks.

1517
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,095
Hey, man, what's up?

1518
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,455
Hey. We're going
camping tonight.

1519
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,615
You in?

1520
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,775
Who's going?

1521
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,804
My brother, one of his
friends, and Tony maybe.

1522
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,201
Yeah, let me check with my mom.

1523
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,320
Mom, can I go camping
with Chase tonight?

1524
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,801
Camping? Where?

1525
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,169
At that house that his family's
building. It's pretty much finished.

1526
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,846
Well, will any adults be there?

1527
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,720
His brother's a senior.

1528
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,175
You have your cell phone?
Yeah.

1529
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,815
Is it charged?

1530
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,841
Okay, do me a favor.

1531
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,241
Leave his parents' number and
the address on the counter.

1532
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,487
Okay.

1533
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,455
Yeah! What
I'm talking about!

1534
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,535
That's it.

1535
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,615
You ready?
Check this shit out.

1536
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,375
That was all right, but
this is gonna be badass.

1537
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,095
All right, let me see.
Let me see what you can do.

1538
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,009
All right.
This is your face.

1539
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,362
I'm about to break
his face, right here.

1540
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,121
All right, man. All right, now check
this out. You might want to move.

1541
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,284
That'd be painful.

1542
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,286
In the kidneys, right?
The stomach? Something.

1543
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,001
Check this out, man.

1544
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,129
Pancreas.

1545
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,575
That shit's lethal.

1546
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,455
Yeah, that would be painful.

1547
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,895
Man, have a beer, man.
That was awesome. Here.

1548
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,175
It's beer 30, children.

1549
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,361
Nice.

1550
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,575
No, thanks.

1551
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,681
Come on, man.

1552
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,495
What are you?
A pussy?

1553
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,727
I just don't feel like
drinking a beer right now.

1554
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,535
Man, if you're too chickenshit
to even have a beer,

1555
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,722
I know for a fact that you
have never gotten any pussy.

1556
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,095
Like you guys have.

1557
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,175
Sure have.

1558
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,201
When?

1559
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,527
Last summer.

1560
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,895
- With who?
- It was awesome.

1561
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,571
Chase went down easy street
and fucked this whore Nancy.

1562
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,735
At least, that's what he said.

1563
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,175
I did. Would I lie?

1564
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,855
Bullshit. Quick,
where were you?

1565
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,135
At Tober's house.

1566
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,335
And she fucked
a couple other guys, too.

1567
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,095
His first piece
of ass was sloppy seconds.

1568
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,135
What about you, Mason?
You ever got any?

1569
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,640
Yeah, you ever made her,
howl into the night?

1570
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,603
A few times.
Really?

1571
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,735
Yeah, right, what was her name?
Lucky?

1572
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,055
No. Jennifer.

1573
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,764
She doesn't live here, though.
She's back in Houston.

1574
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,445
You're fucking lying.

1575
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,455
I don't care if you assholes
believe me or not.

1576
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,415
Let me guess, you were pulling
all kinds of ass back home,

1577
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,335
but once you got
down here, lefty.

1578
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,615
Hey, fuck you.

1579
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,495
I would, but none of
the girls here want to.

1580
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,285
Dude, it's not what they want,
man, it's what you want.

1581
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,975
True dat.

1582
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,095
You know what you
should do, join a band.

1583
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,695
That's all it takes, man.

1584
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,815
Yeah?
Fuck, yeah, dude.

1585
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,655
You don't even have
to play that well.

1586
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,095
You start playing
your instrument,

1587
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,202
and they line up
to give you blowjobs.

1588
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,455
Except for you.

1589
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,655
It doesn't impress
the ladies so much

1590
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,364
when you play flute
for the marching band.

1591
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,335
I'm not in the
fucking marching band.

1592
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,495
Dude, you sure? I heard
you play the skin flute.

1593
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,404
All right, I got
a question for you guys.

1594
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,880
If you think you're so cool,

1595
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,815
why you hanging out with a bunch
of 8th graders on a Friday night?

1596
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,615
Hey. Fuck you,
you little penis wrinkle.

1597
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,971
You're lucky to even be here.

1598
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,455
This is our camp-out.

1599
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,175
The only reason you little
cum gums are here

1600
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,015
is because fucking
Charlie's mom made him

1601
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,815
bring his little asshole brother

1602
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,135
and then he drags along
you little dice danglers.

1603
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,481
Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!

1604
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,975
It's all good, man.

1605
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,775
These little fuzz nuts are going
to get their chance soon enough.

1606
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,325
We got some whores
coming by later.

1607
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,046
- Yeah?
- Hell yeah!

1608
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,695
Now, I know Chase
will fuck anything.

1609
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,175
I mean, I've seen this kid
mount boulders before.

1610
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,521
But what about you guys?
You in?

1611
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,535
- Whatever.
- All right.

1612
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,655
Good man.
All right.

1613
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,255
What about you, Peter Puffer?

1614
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,575
I don't know. Maybe.

1615
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,855
Dude, it's okay to be gay.
We understand.

1616
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,769
Just, you know,
sleep over there.

1617
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,800
I'm not gay.

1618
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,649
Give it some time, man.
You'll realize.

1619
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,087
Fuck y'all.

1620
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,402
See, that's exactly
my point, man.

1621
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,015
Nah, but we don't have
whores coming over.

1622
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,095
We were just fucking with
you to see what you'd say.

1623
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,168
And you just earned
your vag badge.

1624
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,055
Put it next to your bitch card.

1625
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,615
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
you're a bitch.

1626
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,530
Now hold this like
the bitch you are, bitch.

1627
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,602
All right, this shit is
called the death punch.

1628
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,488
Whoa, Jesus!

1629
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,126
Hey.

1630
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,882
You guys made it! Good.

1631
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,289
There you are.
Wow.

1632
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,521
And here you go, hostess.

1633
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,246
Thank you.
Can I get you a bite?

1634
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,215
That's cool.
Thanks.

1635
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,571
You did that?

1636
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,966
Yeah.
Wow.

1637
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,480
How long have you
been doing that for?

1638
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,523
Not very long. Um...

1639
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,648
I went to this camp thing
just this past summer.

1640
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,055
They have a camp for graffiti?

1641
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,082
Well, they call it
"urban art."

1642
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,170
So it sounds, you know,
less illegal,

1643
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,647
but it was really just a way
to get free spray paint.

1644
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,535
Cool. So is this your tag?

1645
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,608
Is that...
Do they still call it...

1646
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,604
Yeah, but you know, it's just
letters that I'm good at writing.

1647
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,087
It's a "K..."

1648
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,095
E.

1649
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,895
"E-Z-J-O."

1650
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,695
Kez Jo.
That's cool.

1651
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,722
It doesn't really
mean anything, though.

1652
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,806
Is that your dad?

1653
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,241
Yeah.

1654
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,441
Where's he live?

1655
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,561
In Houston.

1656
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,451
Get to see him much?

1657
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,331
Yeah. Some weekends
and over the summer.

1658
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,615
Cool.

1659
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,563
So, you're a student
of my mom's, right?

1660
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,695
Yeah, I got one class with her.

1661
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,085
Yeah, she's cool.

1662
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,575
How's she doing? You know, is she
a good teacher and everything?

1663
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,855
Yeah, she's great!

1664
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,375
She's super-smart
and she cares, you know.

1665
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,731
She makes it interesting.

1666
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,651
She's probably even
my favorite teacher.

1667
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,975
So, anyway, we figured
out a way to rig up our iPods

1668
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,923
to the external speakers
on the ASB.

1669
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,535
So every time
we come rolling into town,

1670
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,335
you knew
the 4-56 was there

1671
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,815
'cause we were bumping
House of Pain.

1672
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,015
It was like,
"Jump around, jump around."

1673
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,215
And the whole family's
coming outside,

1674
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,815
you got the kids and,
the mom and the dad

1675
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,410
and they're all
bouncing up and down,

1676
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,975
we're throwing out
candies for the kids

1677
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,615
and soccer balls and Beanie
Babies and Frisbees,

1678
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,775
smokes for the adults,

1679
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,575
and, they loved, they
absolutely loved Gatorade.

1680
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,683
But for some reason, you know,
they hated the lemon-lime flavor.

1681
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,375
I don't know what it was.

1682
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,335
Yeah.
Couldn't give it away.

1683
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,520
How long were you over there?

1684
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,567
I did two tours in Iraq
and one in Bosnia.

1685
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,727
Wow.

1686
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,167
Did you enlist?

1687
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,975
Yeah, I was, um,
Army National Guard,

1688
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,650
and, you know, coming
straight out of high school,

1689
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,215
needed money for college.

1690
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,495
Seemed like a decent paying job.

1691
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,851
And, did my tour.

1692
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,440
And whenever I got done
I told them,

1693
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,370
if there's a world-changing
event, I'll come back.

1694
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,202
And, three months later 9/11
happened, and I was back 9/12.

1695
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,455
And I'm proud to say the 4-56,
the whole time we were there,

1696
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,975
we never lost a guy,
not one casualty.

1697
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,729
But is that odd?
Is that unusual?

1698
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,855
Yeah.

1699
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,723
Almost impossible.

1700
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,175
Like, the guys that came along
after us and replaced us,

1701
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,375
they didn't listen
to any of our advice.

1702
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,055
They did, basically, the polar
opposite of what we did,

1703
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,481
and they lost seven guys
in the first month.

1704
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,721
Wow.

1705
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,765
What did you guys
do differently?

1706
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,295
I like to think it's just a matter
of mutual respect, you know.

1707
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,215
All the time we spent over
there building trust,

1708
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,895
these guys basically
destroyed it in three days.

1709
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,287
So, what did the locals think
about why we're there?

1710
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,048
Oil, plain and simple.

1711
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,530
Hey, Mason.
One last hit.

1712
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,695
Hey.

1713
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,610
Mickey Mouse Club.
Get the fuck out of my car.

1714
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,525
Just crawl out the back
window or something, man.

1715
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,655
I'm gonna miss you.

1716
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,330
I'll see you on Sunday night.

1717
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,881
All right. You better text me.

1718
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,522
Do you have any gum?
Um...

1719
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,563
Yeah, I do, actually.
Here you go.

1720
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,444
Thanks. See ya.

1721
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,295
And they're buying this party line
that they're supposed to feel bad

1722
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,655
and trade off their own pension,

1723
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,335
as if that's what's been
corrupting this nation.

1724
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,175
Yeah, because
those who heart Fox,

1725
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,935
in my opinion,
are being lied to.

1726
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,655
Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin.

1727
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,335
We have to follow that example.

1728
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,805
You're right.

1729
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,764
Hey, Mason, what time is it?

1730
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,281
Like 12:15.

1731
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,361
Happy birthday.

1732
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,000
Happy birthday!

1733
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,815
Mason.

1734
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,855
It's your birthday?

1735
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,375
Just now, I guess.

1736
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,815
Yeah, how old are you?

1737
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,375
Fifteen.

1738
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,815
Fifteen. Give me a hug.

1739
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,684
Happy birthday.
My goodness!

1740
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,370
Have you been drinking?

1741
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,607
Have you?

1742
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,248
Yeah, a little.
Have you?

1743
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,571
A little bit.

1744
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,680
Have you been...

1745
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,324
A little bit.

1746
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,330
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1747
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,042
Talk in the morning?

1748
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,406
Hey, Dad.

1749
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,841
Hey! How you doing? Good.

1750
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,135
Whose car is that?
That's our car.

1751
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,375
Hop on in there.
Hey.

1752
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,970
Hi, sweetie.

1753
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,695
Hey, Cooper.

1754
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,882
Hey! How's it going?

1755
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,885
Hello, little brother.

1756
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,655
He's so cute.

1757
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,695
Can we just replace
that part of the pipe?

1758
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,451
No, is no good.
Everything is no good.

1759
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,041
Everything. Yes, <i>Mira.</i>

1760
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,935
This one is...

1761
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,215
Stronger.

1762
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,810
Yes. This is better,
yes, yes, yes.

1763
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,846
Hey, listen, thanks for
that camera you got Mason.

1764
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,295
Yeah, Mason's all into the photography.
He's loving that thing.

1765
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,455
Yeah, I know.

1766
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,615
He's actually talking about turning
his, closet into a darkroom.

1767
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,015
Like the red light and the
developing, the whole nine...

1768
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,121
You all right with that?

1769
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,368
I probably won't see him for a week.
Yeah. Right.

1770
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,925
But he's having a good time.

1771
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,455
At least he's focused on something.
Yeah. Yeah.

1772
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,200
That's what I like.
Yeah, he's all about it.

1773
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,488
Okay, let's go <i>grande.</i>

1774
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,643
It's good? It's better, yes.
It's good.

1775
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,375
You know, you're smart.
You should be in school.

1776
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,290
I like school, I need school,

1777
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,520
but it's hard,
I working all day.

1778
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,690
Go to night school at community college.
It's pretty affordable.

1779
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,095
You're doing a nice job with the house.
It's looking great.

1780
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,255
Thanks.
Really great.

1781
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,775
Yeah, you know, some
fix-its here and there.

1782
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,815
We got a good deal on a foreclosure,
so now I'm finding out why.

1783
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,081
Yeah, really. Hey, bud! Hey.

1784
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,089
Happy birthday?
What's that?

1785
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,329
What's that? That's our new car.
Get in it.

1786
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,602
All right.
Have a good weekend.

1787
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,289
How you doing?

1788
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,495
Good to see you.
You, too.

1789
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,885
Hey!

1790
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,735
Hey, how are you?

1791
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,089
You look great.
Thanks.

1792
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,495
Look at him!
Aw, he's got Mason's nose.

1793
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,055
- Yeah, isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

1794
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,855
- All right!
- Love you guys.

1795
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,120
We got a big drive ahead of us.

1796
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,615
Bye, Sam.

1797
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:05,960
You guys drive safe.

1798
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,215
All right. Well,
we'll be back tomorrow night.

1799
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,720
Bye, honey.
I'm so glad you were born!

1800
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:31,204
So, this is like Annie's car
and you drive the GTO?

1801
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,215
I guess you can't really put
a baby seat in that thing.

1802
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,244
Yeah, no. But I had
to sell that anyway.

1803
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,455
You what?

1804
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,289
Yeah, I had to sell that.

1805
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,215
So it's gone?

1806
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,655
Yeah, some sucker
collector from California

1807
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,575
paid 22 grand for it,
which is great

1808
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,095
'cause I basically got
to pay for this in cash.

1809
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,691
I only paid $8,500 for
that thing way back when.

1810
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,135
Cars are generally a terrible
investment, you know.

1811
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,415
Soon as you drive
them off the lot,

1812
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,535
you got a used car
on your hands,

1813
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,495
and the value's only
dropping from there.

1814
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,255
But if you take care
of it, you know,

1815
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,855
and you get lucky
and it's a classic,

1816
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,415
the value starts going up again.

1817
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,175
Shit, you got guys paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars

1818
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,123
for some Shelby Cobra.

1819
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,206
What?

1820
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,645
You don't remember?

1821
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,568
Remember what?
Really?

1822
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,367
You said that was going to
be my car when I turned 16.

1823
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,495
What? No,
I didn't. I never said that.

1824
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,455
I remember.
I was in third grade

1825
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,015
and you were taking me over to Anthony
Nadar's house for his birthday,

1826
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,611
and we were there early, so we
gave him a ride around the block,

1827
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,455
and he was talking about how
much he loved your car,

1828
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:48,241
and so you were all like, "This is
gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."

1829
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,575
All right, first off, I have
no memory of that, all right?

1830
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,126
Second of all, I would
never say that. Never.

1831
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,135
You did, though.

1832
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,366
What?

1833
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,846
Mason.

1834
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,601
Come on, what about your sister?

1835
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,975
I'm just gonna forget about her?

1836
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,128
Come on, how's that fair?

1837
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,529
Anthony Nagar. What...

1838
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,895
Are you...

1839
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,331
Come on!

1840
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,842
I mean, you're not...

1841
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,695
Look, you can sit there like there's
a death in the family, all right,

1842
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,615
but bottom line is, that was my car.
All right?

1843
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,895
I paid for it,
I took care of it,

1844
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,695
and I can do whatever
I want with it. All right?

1845
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,295
I'm sorry if you had other ideas
about it, but when you get older,

1846
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,415
you can save up
and buy a car of your own.

1847
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,647
Be cool like I used to be.

1848
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,167
Or you can get a minivan.

1849
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,015
Does your mom actually
let you watch this?

1850
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,122
Yeah. She likes it, too.

1851
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,245
My God.

1852
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,685
Okay, well, have you ever
seen her in concert?

1853
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,215
No, but she's coming
to Houston in April.

1854
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,015
She's coming to Houston?

1855
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,215
Your dad and I could get you tickets
and you could stay with us.

1856
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,083
That'd be great!
Yeah.

1857
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,735
- Hey, Annie?
- Yup.

1858
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,735
Will you get me the little
birthday present for Mason?

1859
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,895
Here, babe.
All right.

1860
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,641
This one needs
a little explanation, okay?

1861
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,615
Open it up.

1862
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,615
I call that
the Beatles Black Album.

1863
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,455
What it is, is the best of
John, Paul, George and Ringo,

1864
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,482
solo, post-breakup.

1865
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,615
Thanks.

1866
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,535
Basically, I put the band back
together for you.

1867
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,415
Whenever you listen
to too much of the solo stuff,

1868
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,055
it kind of becomes a drag,
you know?

1869
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,455
But you put them next
to each other, right,

1870
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,135
and they start
to elevate each other,

1871
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,491
and then you can hear it.

1872
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,251
It's The Beatles, you know?

1873
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,850
I don't know. I think I always
just liked Paul the best.

1874
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,565
It doesn't matter, you know,
you're missing the point.

1875
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,775
There is no favorite Beatle!

1876
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,895
That's what I'm saying.
It's in the balance.

1877
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,095
That's what made them
the greatest fucking rock band

1878
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,335
in the world, okay?

1879
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,455
And there's this decade
of music out there

1880
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,935
that's been scattered,
all right,

1881
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,175
and now it has been carefully
found, arranged and ordered for you

1882
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,775
by your loving father.

1883
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,655
Very arranged
and very organized,

1884
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,001
over and over again
by your loving father.

1885
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,455
Yes, yes, yes.

1886
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,295
So, I mean,
look at that, look at that.

1887
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,535
Top of Volume II,
first four tracks,

1888
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,855
you've got <i>Band on the Run</i>
into <i>My Sweet Lord</i>

1889
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,804
into <i>Jealous Guy</i>
into <i>Photograph.</i> Come on!

1890
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,575
It's like the perfect segue.

1891
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,975
You got Paul,
who takes you to the party,

1892
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,975
George who talks
to you about God,

1893
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,335
John is just, "No,
it's about love and pain,"

1894
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,415
and then Ringo who just says,

1895
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,295
"Hey. Can't we enjoy what
we have while we have it?"

1896
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,561
It's a good record.
I shit you not.

1897
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,241
Cool.

1898
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,215
Hey, there, Cliff.
Hey, how you doing?

1899
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,720
Good. How you doing?
Hi, birthday boy!

1900
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,015
It's good to see you.

1901
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,883
It's great to see you. Yeah.

1902
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,495
You made it all right?

1903
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,735
Yeah, we sure did.
We sure did.

1904
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,841
How are you, darling?

1905
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,015
Let's just get this one...
All right, we ready?

1906
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,087
Yeah.

1907
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,281
Wait.

1908
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,935
Hey, Sam.

1909
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,803
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

1910
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,535
Hey, still sleeping here?

1911
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,735
Yeah.

1912
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,000
Hey, buddy.

1913
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,522
Make a wish, make a wish.

1914
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,695
Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait.
Here, sweetie.

1915
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,760
Sam, would you get us
a knife so we can cut this up?

1916
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,161
All right.

1917
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:30,286
I hope you like it. I
heard you didn't have one, so.

1918
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,687
It's a Bible. This is your first Bible.

1919
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,202
Look, there's your name.

1920
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,895
Wow. In gold. And
wait, wait, wait.

1921
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,535
Look at this.

1922
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,735
It's a red-letter edition,

1923
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,889
and that means that everything
that Jesus said is in red.

1924
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,535
Thank you. You like it?
All right.

1925
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,369
I love you, sweetie.
Happy birthday.

1926
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,895
And this one's from us.

1927
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,615
Yeah, here.

1928
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,855
It's not going to make all
your dreams come true here.

1929
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,335
Just keep your expectations low.

1930
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,535
No, you need it.
It's...

1931
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,735
Come on, right? You gotta have it.
You need this.

1932
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,255
You got life ahead of you.

1933
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,775
And the shirt is blue.

1934
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,935
You got dances
and job interviews.

1935
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,695
Here, I'm going to get
it all wrinkled here.

1936
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,043
Mason? Come here, son.

1937
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,322
Pull that off.

1938
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,207
There's a 20-gauge shotgun.
Wow.

1939
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,455
My dad gave it to me when I was
a little younger than you,

1940
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,655
and his dad gave it to him.

1941
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:36,481
Well, you're 15 and I'd like
for you to have it, all right?

1942
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,882
Here, you hold it.

1943
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,920
Yeah?

1944
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,655
Thank you.
Congratulations, son.

1945
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,215
I'll teach you how to clean it,

1946
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,083
teach you how to fire it.

1947
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,695
I'll teach
you a little bit of safety.

1948
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,135
Now cock it.
All right, there you go.

1949
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,655
Now, what you want to do is line up
the front sight with the back sight.

1950
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,091
Here, you see this little V right here?

1951
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,335
Now which one you aiming at?

1952
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,415
The middle can.

1953
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,885
The middle can? All right.

1954
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,206
Now fire at will, all right?

1955
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,805
Ho! Whoa!
Yeah!

1956
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:09,729
All right, watch out, watch out.
Whoa. Be careful. All right.

1957
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,361
Ready?

1958
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,361
Pull!

1959
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,363
You hit a little low.

1960
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,295
Wait till it gets up high,
then shoot, all right?

1961
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,290
'Cause then it's a better
aim coming down.

1962
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,775
Remember, second trigger.

1963
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,484
Ready?

1964
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,166
Pull!

1965
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,084
Look what you did! Well,
you nailed it, didn't you?

1966
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,975
How did that feel?
Felt good.

1967
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,604
Yeah, it felt good. Good.

1968
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,885
<i>Well, I want for
us to be together forever</i>

1969
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,135
<i>But to wander wherever I may</i>

1970
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,055
<i>I want you to be easy and casual</i>

1971
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,575
<i>But still demand I stay</i>

1972
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,285
<i>I want for you
to know me completely</i>

1973
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,368
<i>But still remain mysterious</i>

1974
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,215
<i>Consider everything deeply</i>

1975
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,720
<i>But still remain fearless</i>

1976
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,775
<i>Climb to the top
Look over the ledge</i>

1977
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,975
<i>Dance barefoot on a razor's edge</i>

1978
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,975
<i>Reach for the stars
Grab a tiger by the tail</i>

1979
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,255
<i>If I don't try, I'll never fail</i>

1980
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,965
<i>If you go
home You're rolling the dice</i>

1981
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,775
<i>Can't step
in the same river twice</i>

1982
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,883
<i>You love too much
It'll turn to hate</i>

1983
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,935
<i>You never leave home
You'll never be late</i>

1984
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,335
<i>You eat too much
You're gonna get fat</i>

1985
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,015
<i>If you buy a dog
You'll piss off your cat</i>

1986
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,095
<i>So take a deep breath
and enjoy the ride</i>

1987
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:48,401
<i>'Cause arrivals and departures
Run side by side</i>

1988
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,126
You're our first
audience, you know?

1989
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,095
Mason demanded we work
on it the whole time.

1990
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,455
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1991
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,970
It's a work in progress.

1992
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,615
A week later, we don't know why

1993
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,895
Thomas wasn't there
the first time,

1994
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,935
but a week later,
Thomas comes back

1995
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,455
and joins the other disciples.

1996
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,655
They say, "The Lord's
alive, we saw him!"

1997
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,455
"I won't believe it until I
put my finger into his side,"

1998
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,455
"and I wanna see those
nail prints in his hands."

1999
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,495
About
that time, here comes Jesus

2000
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,895
standing right
next to him, okay?

2001
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,447
And he turns to Thomas. Don't you
know, Thomas felt some shame.

2002
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,735
He turns to Thomas and says,

2003
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,535
"Thomas, here, stick
your finger in my side."

2004
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,483
"Look at these nail prints.
It's me."

2005
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:37,000
And Thomas says, "My Lord
and my God, I believe."

2006
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,001
And Jesus said,
"Well, that's good,"

2007
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,804
"but blessed are those who
can believe without seeing."

2008
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,922
It's a lot easier when you
can see and feel and touch,

2009
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:53,408
but like us, we haven't
seen him in the flesh,

2010
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,415
we haven't felt him
in the flesh,

2011
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,761
but we have experienced
him in the spirit.

2012
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,360
At least, I have,
and I hope y'all have, too.

2013
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,202
The pond's right up here.

2014
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,895
It's low.

2015
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,206
Yeah.

2016
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,335
You know, my dad could
take you fishing

2017
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,655
next time you're here
if you want.

2018
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,886
Thanks.

2019
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:20,729
Hi, baby.
What's goin' on?

2020
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,895
No, I think we're just gonna
hang here for a minute.

2021
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,415
You want me to stay with you?

2022
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,855
No, it's okay.
You sure?

2023
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:27,881
Yeah. Thanks.

2024
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:36,610
Mason, why are you
such a stick-in-the-mud?

2025
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,215
What are you even talking about?

2026
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,055
You guys don't mind coming
back here on the 20th, do you,

2027
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,215
for Cooper's baptism?

2028
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,415
No, that's fine.
Sam?

2029
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,015
I appreciate it.

2030
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,884
It means a lot to Annie
and her folks, you know.

2031
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,444
Were we baptized?

2032
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,407
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with the state of your soul.

2033
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,415
We can do it now,
though, if you want.

2034
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,535
No, I think I'm all right.

2035
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,495
You and Cooper together,
you know.

2036
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,090
Dunk your heads.

2037
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,295
You're not becoming one of those
God people, are you, Dad?

2038
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,135
And what's that
supposed to mean?

2039
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,049
I can hear you!

2040
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,055
Wow.

2041
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,321
I think that shotgun should
live at my house?

2042
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,681
I don't think your mom would love that.

2043
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,455
Look out, Sam.

2044
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,403
Let me show you how it's done.

2045
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,640
Nice, Dad.

2046
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,689
Still got the goods?

2047
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,935
How long you been
in here, Mason?

2048
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,041
I'm not sure.

2049
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,975
I'm sure.

2050
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,525
All class.

2051
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,685
Did you complete
your image diary?

2052
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,001
Not yet.

2053
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,135
Completed your,
digital contact sheet?

2054
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,084
Not quite, but it's
not gonna take me long.

2055
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,847
Not yet. Not quite.

2056
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,447
Dark room time
is extra-curricular.

2057
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,135
I mean, technically, you don't ever
have to be in here these days,

2058
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,735
and certainly not until you've
completed your assignments.

2059
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,807
That's the deal.

2060
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,326
Sorry.

2061
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,444
I'm worried about you, Mason.

2062
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,135
Why is that?

2063
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,286
I'll tell you why.

2064
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,842
The images you're turning
in, they're cool.

2065
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,455
You're looking at things
in a really unique way.

2066
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,209
Got a lot of natural talent.

2067
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,135
Thanks.

2068
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,175
Yeah, but that and 50 cents

2069
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,044
will just get you a cup of
coffee in this old world.

2070
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,888
I've met a lot of talented
people over the years.

2071
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:47,935
How many of them
made it professionally

2072
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,255
without discipline, commitment

2073
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,521
and a really good work ethic?

2074
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,689
I can tell you. I can
count it on two fingers.

2075
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,647
Zero.

2076
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,935
It's not gonna happen
for you, Mason.

2077
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,735
The world is too competitive.

2078
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:06,175
There are too many talented people
who are willing to work hard,

2079
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,124
and a butt load of morons
who are untalented

2080
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,083
who are more than
willing to surpass you.

2081
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,255
As a matter of fact, a lot of them
are sitting in that classroom

2082
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,695
out there right now?

2083
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,815
You know what they're doing?

2084
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,495
They're doing their assignments.

2085
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,535
Which is what you're supposed
to be doing, but you're not.

2086
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,735
You're in here.

2087
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,091
Now why is that?

2088
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,295
You special, Mason?

2089
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,415
No, but the things
you're talking about,

2090
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,255
like work ethic or whatever,

2091
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,930
I feel like I do
work pretty hard.

2092
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,969
I spend the whole weekend
taking pictures a lot of times.

2093
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,962
You like football, Mason?

2094
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,364
Not really.

2095
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,575
Yeah, I know you don't.

2096
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,655
That's why
I've just assigned you

2097
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,735
to shoot the football
game tonight. Okay?

2098
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,975
It starts at 7:30, I want
you to get there early,

2099
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,055
I want you to shoot a full card, 300
images, I want them downloaded,

2100
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,607
I want them sorted, and I want to
see them very first thing Monday.

2101
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,525
You want to know
why I'm doing this?

2102
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,855
I guess.

2103
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,609
Who do you want to be, Mason?

2104
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,575
What do you want to do?

2105
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,524
I want to take pictures.
Make art.

2106
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,448
Any dipshit can
take pictures, Mason.

2107
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,766
Art, that's special.

2108
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,327
What can you bring to it
that nobody else can?

2109
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,404
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

2110
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,655
Try harder.

2111
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,615
Maybe in 20 years you can call old Mr.
Turlington and you can say,

2112
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,455
"Thank you, sir,"

2113
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,290
"for that terrific darkroom
chat we had that day."

2114
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,280
Get back to class
and do your work.

2115
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,684
Hey, man, you're walkin'
a little funny.

2116
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,455
Fuck you.

2117
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,485
I'm just saying, you guys were
in there for a long time.

2118
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,011
Just hope he bought
you dinner first.

2119
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,365
Mason! Honey,
come down for dinner.

2120
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,535
Samantha! You didn't post these
pictures and their descriptions?

2121
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,775
Come on. This auction is
gonna end on Sunday, honey.

2122
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,768
You've gotta get those posted.

2123
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,735
Why are we even doing this?

2124
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,615
It's like an online junk shop.

2125
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:34,935
I thought you had a good job.

2126
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,406
I do. We're what
you call house poor.

2127
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,415
Everyone's got to do their part.

2128
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,680
Your brother took the pictures.

2129
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,655
You have to help.

2130
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:44,015
Who even buys this shit?

2131
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,535
Hey. Sam, watch your mouth,
all right?

2132
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,175
Don't disrespect your mother.

2133
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,840
You like a roof over
your head, don't you?

2134
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,655
Yeah, and you like
having electricity

2135
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,200
so that you can charge
your cell phone?

2136
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,641
I'm not even gonna
be here next year.

2137
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,725
I'm a senior.
I should be having fun.

2138
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,401
Nice nails.

2139
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,251
Yeah, some girl did
that in sixth period.

2140
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,855
You planning on keeping them?

2141
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,042
Until it comes off, I guess.

2142
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,205
Last summer it was the
earrings, and now the nails.

2143
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,295
You got a purse
to go with all that?

2144
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,608
A lot of guys do that.
He's just trying to be cool.

2145
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,003
When I was in high school,
having a job,

2146
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,764
being responsible, being able
to afford a car, that was cool.

2147
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,761
Mason, honey,

2148
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,611
why don't you get you and
your sister some water.

2149
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,975
Hey, man, Turlington says to cut
the artsy crap and shoot the game.

2150
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,295
So take your lens
and point it that way.

2151
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,375
Jesus Christ.

2152
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,655
Also, we got a ride.

2153
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,175
McCormick's gonna
take us to the party.

2154
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,975
We're gonna head out
after the game.

2155
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,135
You're goin', okay?

2156
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,215
Okay.

2157
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,890
Shoot the game.

2158
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:24,929
First one! What was that?
What was that? What is up?

2159
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,855
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

2160
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,095
How's it goin'?

2161
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,495
Pretty good.

2162
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,010
How long have you been here?

2163
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,015
I don't know.
Awhile, I guess.

2164
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,371
Awhile?

2165
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:57,535
I just feel like there are so
many things that I could be doing

2166
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,375
and probably want to be
doing that I'm just not.

2167
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,447
Why aren't you?

2168
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,535
I mean, I guess it's just being
afraid of what people would think.

2169
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,369
You know, judgment.
Yeah.

2170
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,495
I guess it's really easy
to say like,

2171
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,090
"I don't care
what anyone else thinks,"

2172
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,375
but everyone does, you know?
Exactly.

2173
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,765
Deep down.

2174
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,895
I find myself so furious at all these
people that I'm in contact with

2175
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,575
just for controlling me
or whatever,

2176
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,763
but, you know, they're not
even aware they're doing it.

2177
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,611
Yeah.

2178
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:33,135
So, in this perfect world, where
no one's controlling you,

2179
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,561
what's different?
What changes?

2180
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,615
Everything.

2181
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,723
I mean, I just wanna be
able to do anything I want,

2182
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,291
because it makes me feel alive.

2183
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,402
As opposed to giving me
the appearance of normality.

2184
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,843
Whatever that means.

2185
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,086
I don't think it means much.

2186
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,287
You're kinda weird, you know that?

2187
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,807
Yeah?

2188
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,095
Is that a compliment?

2189
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,090
I don't know.
Do you wanna be weird?

2190
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,845
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids
at the park, or anything like that.

2191
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,166
I really like talking with you.

2192
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,935
I don't usually even try
to vocalize my thoughts

2193
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,371
or feelings or anything.

2194
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,363
I don't know, it never sounds right.
Words are stupid.

2195
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,601
So, why are you trying with me?

2196
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,327
I don't know.
I guess I feel comfortable.

2197
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,210
I'm glad.

2198
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,135
Hey, Jim.

2199
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,366
I'm sorry I'm so late.

2200
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,607
What time are you
supposed to be home?

2201
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,842
I don't know.
A while ago.

2202
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,526
While ago like, 30 minutes
ago, an hour ago?

2203
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,535
'Cause truthfully
nobody even knew

2204
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,215
where you were
until your sister told us.

2205
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:55,924
She's been home for a while.

2206
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,531
I'm sorry.

2207
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,970
Yeah, been hearin'
a lot of that lately.

2208
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:06,295
See, but you
don't actually care.

2209
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,166
You just kinda come
and go as you please,

2210
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,815
and you don't care
if your mom's upset,

2211
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,127
or what time you gotta be home.

2212
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,930
Is that what's up?

2213
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,335
I don't know what to tell you.

2214
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,015
Stop mumbling!

2215
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,804
You know, speak up!

2216
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,495
I can't understand a word
comin' out of your mouth.

2217
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,535
It's just like...

2218
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,535
And I ask you questions
and you just...

2219
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,131
Can I just have one day where
everyone isn't all over my ass?

2220
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,883
I'm up your ass?

2221
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,695
This is my house.
All right?

2222
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,535
If you wanna live in my house,

2223
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,935
then you get home when you
say you're gonna be home.

2224
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,450
You know, Jim,
you're not my dad.

2225
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,295
No, I'm not your dad.

2226
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,449
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm actually here.

2227
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,767
I'm the guy with the job,
payin' the bills,

2228
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,766
takin' care of you, your
mom, your sister?

2229
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,570
I'm that guy!

2230
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,084
Morning.
Morning.

2231
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,206
Hey. Which one of you guys used the
downstairs bathroom last night?

2232
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,127
I don't know.
I didn't.

2233
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,964
That tall guy, what's his name?

2234
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,695
Phillip?

2235
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:41,255
Yeah, Phillip. He did it.
Can Phillip read?

2236
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,375
You know, there's
a big sign on the door.

2237
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,095
It says, "Do not use this
bathroom, it's broken."

2238
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,282
I mean, how difficult is that?

2239
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,128
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

2240
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:56,160
I think I'm gonna put the
house on the market.

2241
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,735
Why?

2242
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,295
This house is too big for us.

2243
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,935
You're going to
school eventually.

2244
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,008
It's too expensive.
I'm done.

2245
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,609
Why did you even buy it
in the first place then?

2246
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:11,295
Because I really enjoy
making poor life decisions,

2247
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,800
keeping us on
the brink of poverty.

2248
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:18,175
I've spent the first half of my
life acquiring all this crap,

2249
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,975
and now I'm gonna spend
the second half of my life

2250
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,655
getting rid of all this stuff.

2251
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,887
Really? Like what?

2252
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,655
Well, I got rid of
a couple husbands,

2253
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:28,055
now I'm gonna get rid
of a mortgage,

2254
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,455
some maintenance,
the tchotchskes,

2255
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,246
the homeowner's insurance, the
property tax, the plumbing.

2256
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,535
You know what?
From now on,

2257
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,528
I am gonna be Mommy Monk.

2258
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,202
Simple. Celibate.

2259
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,209
Don't be gross, Mom.

2260
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,686
Fine.

2261
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,335
I'll be a poor whore
with a big house.

2262
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,811
Is that better?

2263
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,085
Okay.

2264
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:05,646
Mason, please, don't leave
me that dirty dish to wash.

2265
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,206
I do dishes all day.

2266
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,175
Great! Honey,
then you're a professional.

2267
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,215
Come on, you could do one or two
more for your poor old mom.

2268
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,401
Okay.

2269
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,843
Thank you.

2270
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,885
You want one?

2271
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,295
God!

2272
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,481
She didn't even
touch them, seriously.

2273
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:45,965
I watched her the whole time.

2274
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,925
I bet you did watch her,
you little pervert.

2275
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:54,015
It's like we're on a date.

2276
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,769
Cheers.

2277
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,444
It's a night of romance.

2278
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,082
Yeah, except
I'm not gonna kiss you.

2279
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,802
I will blow you, though.

2280
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,735
Mason! We are in
the weeds out here!

2281
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,125
I'm goin' as fast as I can.

2282
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,455
Then I must be confused then,

2283
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,295
'cause I just saw you
chattin' it up with April,

2284
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,095
when I got a salad bar
that needs a refill,

2285
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,655
I got a six-top,
two four-tops I can't use

2286
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,966
because they
haven't been bussed!

2287
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,368
Enrique is not here.
I'm tryin'.

2288
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,255
Well, while you're tryin',
we're dyin'!

2289
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,135
What am I supposed
to tell my customers?

2290
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:37,095
"I'm sorry that your table's
got dirty plates on it,"

2291
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,645
"but Mason's trying."

2292
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,815
"At least that's
what he told me."

2293
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,650
"After he was flirtin' with April
and eatin' your leftover shrimp."

2294
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,881
Now it is a challenge
out there today, I know,

2295
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,529
but I wanna share
something with you.

2296
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,255
I got you pegged
for fry cook this summer,

2297
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,123
and that's a lot
more responsibility.

2298
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,444
It's also more money.
How's that sound?

2299
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,527
Good.

2300
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,295
I know you can
handle that money,

2301
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,721
but can you take
the responsibility?

2302
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,735
I think you can,
because I believe in you.

2303
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,880
But I need you on the floor.

2304
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,083
Now leave the dishes.
Giddy up.

2305
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,167
All right, come on!
Don't let me down!

2306
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,563
<i>Well, so it's runnin' okay? That
alternator's not messin' up anymore?</i>

2307
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,003
No, it's fine.
It's up for the trip.

2308
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,840
<i>Good.</i>

2309
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:29,495
<i>Are you gonna see your sister
when you guys are in Austin?</i>

2310
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,815
Yeah, she said I can stay
at her dorm, which is cool.

2311
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,207
And I guess her roommate's out
of town, so it's no big deal.

2312
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:36,695
<i>All right.
Did you apply there yet?</i>

2313
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,375
<i>Did you get that
application in to UT?</i>

2314
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,215
Not yet, but Sheena's
pretty much in, though.

2315
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,295
<i>Right. Well, if you know
that's where you wanna go,</i>

2316
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,055
<i>you should probably do that early
acceptance thing, you know?</i>

2317
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,526
<i>Seriously, let 'em know you're
a man who knows what he wants.</i>

2318
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,695
Yeah.

2319
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:53,042
<i>A little bit of decisiveness goes a
long way in this life, all right?</i>

2320
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,615
Yeah.
<i>Great.</i>

2321
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:56,529
<i>And what about work?
How's that goin'?</i>

2322
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:59,255
I don't know.
It's all right.

2323
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,169
Today kind of sucked.
This guy didn't show up.

2324
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,965
But it's definitely an interesting
perspective on the world.

2325
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:06,890
People are slobs.

2326
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,975
<i>Well, when people ask me
about you, I say to them,</i>

2327
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,375
<i>"Mason, he's doing great."</i>

2328
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,370
<i>"He's got a job,
he's really cleanin' up."</i>

2329
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,363
<i>All right, say hi to Annie
and Cooper, will you?</i>

2330
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,375
<i>Say hi to your big brother.
"Hey, big brother."</i>

2331
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,415
Hey, Annie.
Hey, kiddo.

2332
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,646
<i>Can you say bye-bye?</i>

2333
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,444
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

2334
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,410
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

2335
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,560
<i>All right. Well, be careful
when you're driving, all right?</i>

2336
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,095
<i>Don't be texting, don't be doing
any of that. All right, just.</i>

2337
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:40,655
<i>You're Obi-Wan. You're
centered, patient. Right?</i>

2338
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,895
<i>You watch three cars ahead,
two behind.</i>

2339
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,415
<i>Takes two bad drivers
to have an accident, okay?</i>

2340
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,441
Okay.

2341
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,415
<i>Listen, tell your sister to pick up her
phone or call me back or something.</i>

2342
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,935
Okay.
<i>All right, buddy.</i>

2343
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,122
<i>You have a good one.</i>
Bye, Dad.

2344
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,415
Hey, honey, take this
to your sister.

2345
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,975
Throw it in the truck, okay?

2346
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,764
Okay, I will.

2347
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,851
So where is Sheena staying?

2348
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,326
At her friend Emily's.

2349
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,375
Is Emily a real person?

2350
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,735
Yeah.

2351
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,764
Yeah, she's a sophomore.
She has an apartment.

2352
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:16,015
Okay, this is in case
of emergency.

2353
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,775
Don't spend it, I want it back.

2354
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,643
Okay. Thanks.

2355
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,400
Did you do your homework?

2356
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,887
Most of it, but I can
finish tomorrow night.

2357
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,575
Honey, 11th grade is really important
for college. Don't blow it.

2358
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:32,047
I know, I know. I mean, we're
going to UT and everything.

2359
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,535
Don't you want me to come?

2360
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,655
"Come on, Sheena, road trip
with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.

2361
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:37,806
Fine.

2362
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,608
Just kidding. I have work.

2363
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,375
Call me when you get there.

2364
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,606
I will.

2365
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,295
Have fun!

2366
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,575
That sounds to
me like just another

2367
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:01,967
extreme Mason
view of everything.

2368
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,535
Not at all!
I finally figured it out.

2369
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,455
It's like when they realized
it was gonna be too expensive

2370
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:11,371
to actually build
cyborgs and robots.

2371
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,655
I mean, the costs
of that were impossible.

2372
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,495
They decided to just let humans

2373
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,655
turn themselves into robots.

2374
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,335
That's what's
going on right now.

2375
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,535
Right now?

2376
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,615
Yeah! I mean, why not?

2377
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:26,043
They're billions of us just laying
around, not really doing anything.

2378
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,815
We don't cost anything.

2379
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:33,528
We're even pretty good at self-maintenance
and reproducing constantly.

2380
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:38,895
And as it turns out, we're
already biologically programmed

2381
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,775
for our little cyborg upgrades.

2382
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,495
How?
Seriously.

2383
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:45,015
I read this thing
the other day about how...

2384
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,815
When you hear
that ding on your inbox,

2385
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,615
you get like a dopamine
rush in your brain.

2386
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,375
It's like we're being
chemically rewarded

2387
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,926
for allowing ourselves
to be brainwashed.

2388
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:58,808
How evil is that?
We're fucked.

2389
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,010
So you deleting your Facebook
page is gonna change all that?

2390
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,375
Remember when Trevor deleted
his Facebook page last year

2391
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,335
and everyone just hated him?

2392
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,691
You made more fun
of him than anyone.

2393
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,609
I still make fun
of Trevor though.

2394
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,403
It was like he was so pathetically
desperate for attention.

2395
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,175
Or to be different,
or something.

2396
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:21,602
That's just 'cause they did that lame
story about it in the school paper.

2397
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,655
And then he had to make
a big announcement about it

2398
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,295
when he came back a month later.

2399
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,495
That's the thing, though, I'm
not doing it for attention.

2400
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,895
I just wanna try and not live
my life through a screen.

2401
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:34,895
I want some kind of
actual interaction.

2402
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,481
A real person, not just
the profile they put up.

2403
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,248
I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?

2404
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,135
Yeah, okay,
I know you're joking.

2405
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,375
But, I mean, it's kind of true.

2406
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,415
You have been, you know, checking
your phone this whole time,

2407
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,851
so, what're you really doing?

2408
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:52,255
You don't care what your friends
are up to on a Saturday afternoon,

2409
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:57,975
but you're also obviously not fully
experiencing my profound bitching.

2410
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,575
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just
stuck in like an in-between state.

2411
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,815
Not really
experiencing anything.

2412
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,081
It's not an experience,
it's just information.

2413
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,095
Look. For example,

2414
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:12,775
I just got the address of the club
where we're meeting them later,

2415
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,122
so we won't be wandering the streets
of Austin lost for an hour tonight.

2416
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:18,295
Thank you very much, Facebook.

2417
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,004
And then I just texted
my mom back.

2418
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,575
That's groundbreaking.

2419
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:25,171
She hasn't seen you in,
like, 55 minutes?

2420
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,415
My God, most importantly,

2421
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,364
Meg's family just got
a miniature pet pig.

2422
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:41,484
Okay, you're right. That is
a really cute, tiny pig.

2423
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,364
Our lives can go on.

2424
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,885
I want one.

2425
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,775
Nice shot.

2426
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,335
Yeah, just give the
lady at the front y'all's IDs

2427
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,408
and, she should let you in.

2428
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:00,121
It's Room 206, right?
Awesome.

2429
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,975
It's not weird that
we're staying there, is it?

2430
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,815
No, it's fine. Have fun.

2431
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:06,205
Thank you.

2432
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,403
How long have you
guys been dating?

2433
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,249
About three months.

2434
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:14,647
Yeah, we met at a party
and it's been chill.

2435
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,128
Yeah, he seems cool.
Yeah, he is.

2436
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:19,920
- Does he go to UT, too? Cool.
- Yeah.

2437
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,455
What does he study?

2438
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:26,975
He's studying history and Italian,
I think, his minor, yeah.

2439
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,968
Does he wanna teach Italian?

2440
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,255
I think he's still
figuring stuff out.

2441
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,455
Yeah.
He'll figure it out.

2442
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,086
He's smart.
Smart, yeah.

2443
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,415
So, where are you thinking about
living when you come here?

2444
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,255
Um, I'm not really sure yet.

2445
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:42,215
We're gonna look
at apartments tomorrow.

2446
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,401
Um...

2447
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,729
But I know my parents sort of were
expecting me to live in a dorm.

2448
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,295
But I'm paying
my way through college,

2449
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,695
so it doesn't
really matter that much.

2450
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,695
You don't have to listen to
your parents after you turn 18.

2451
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:57,644
Especially if they're not
helping you financially.

2452
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,603
That's what I figured.

2453
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,255
But living in a dorm isn't so bad.
Yeah?

2454
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,055
I mean, especially
if it's a coed dorm.

2455
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,135
Yeah.

2456
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:09,370
I mean, I've never been around
so many cute guys at once.

2457
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,921
Like, college is really fun.

2458
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,762
I'm excited.
It's great, yeah.

2459
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:32,095
The last death at the Hoover
Dam construction site

2460
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:35,455
was his son, Patrick Tierney,

2461
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:40,042
who died on December 20th, 1935,

2462
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,522
exactly 13 years to the day.

2463
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,161
See those
sorority girls over there?

2464
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,004
I've just decided,

2465
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,575
if you delete your Facebook
page, I'm pledging.

2466
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:56,566
Yeah, in just
a few years that's you,

2467
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,615
and that's gonna be me.

2468
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,406
...inlaid into the terrazzo
floors was a star map,

2469
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:07,295
a celestial map of heavenly
bodies so accurately displayed

2470
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,449
that one could chart the
procession of the pole star

2471
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,175
14,000 years into the future, such
that future generations upon...

2472
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,655
I wonder what his deal is.

2473
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,967
I mean, he obviously
has money to eat here.

2474
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:22,450
He just said. He's a UT
professor, tenure and everything.

2475
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,528
Look at all these people.

2476
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,001
What're they even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning?

2477
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,811
What are we even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning?

2478
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,570
We know what we're doing here.

2479
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:35,842
<i>Queso.</i> We have a purpose.

2480
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:39,807
Hell, yeah.

2481
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,288
You know, by next summer,
this'll just be our lives.

2482
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:50,811
Staying out all night, going
to shows, whatever we want.

2483
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,215
We ever gonna go to class?

2484
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,687
Sometimes.

2485
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,964
When it feels right.
When the inspiration hits.

2486
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,685
Only then.

2487
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,455
Anything else?

2488
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,801
More <i>queso?</i>
Yeah.

2489
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,450
Jesus.

2490
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,451
What?

2491
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,175
I don't know, doesn't it all
seem a little overwhelming?

2492
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,123
I mean, college?

2493
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:25,575
I mean, I like the idea
of being away from home

2494
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:28,015
and gaining skills and getting
better at photography.

2495
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:29,375
I just...

2496
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,775
I don't know,
I'm not counting on it

2497
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,935
being some big,
transformative experience.

2498
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:36,015
I don't think
it's that transformative.

2499
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,055
I just see it as the next step.

2500
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:39,775
But it's like a preordained slot

2501
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,963
that's already got
your name and number on it.

2502
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,602
I don't think
it's the key to my future.

2503
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:47,575
'Cause, I mean, look at my mom.

2504
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:50,809
She got her degree
and got a pretty good job.

2505
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,455
She can pay her bills.

2506
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,244
I like your mom.

2507
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,086
I like my mom, too.
I just mean...

2508
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,484
Basically she's still just
as fuckin' confused as I am.

2509
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,286
Thank you.
Thanks.

2510
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:17,048
- Hello?
- Hey.

2511
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,495
Um...

2512
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:21,842
Did Sam tell you
we were gonna stay here?

2513
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,695
No.

2514
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:25,926
Sorry. Um...

2515
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:30,855
She said you were out of
town for the weekend.

2516
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,486
Yeah, I was.
I just got back.

2517
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,888
Are you her brother?

2518
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,855
Yeah, I'm Mason.

2519
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,405
Um, this is Sheena.

2520
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:44,606
Hello. Great.

2521
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,975
All right. I'm gonna leave
my stuff here, if it's okay,

2522
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,729
and get something to eat.

2523
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:53,161
I'll just come back
in a little bit?

2524
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,489
Yeah, yeah, we have to
get out of here soon anyway.

2525
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,735
All right.
It's nice meeting you.

2526
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,967
- Yeah. You, too.
- Sorry!

2527
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,327
That was so awkward.

2528
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,807
Mason,
silver-medal winner.

2529
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,455
Congratulations!

2530
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,527
Thank you.

2531
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,802
Heard you got a scholarship.
Yeah.

2532
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,615
Yeah, every little
bit helps, you know.

2533
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:46,015
Yeah. When you gonna
go out there?

2534
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:47,815
End of the summer, I think.

2535
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,765
Work some more before then, try
to save up some money, at least.

2536
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:54,487
Yeah, before you have to
fend for yourself. Yeah.

2537
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,411
Yeah, that's the idea.

2538
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:58,120
Well, how are you
feeling about it?

2539
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:00,010
Excited, you know.

2540
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,327
But kind of half-excited,
half-terrified.

2541
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,415
Yeah, kind of that
voluptuous panic.

2542
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:06,055
Yeah. Exactly.

2543
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,855
Well, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be crazy good.

2544
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,455
I liked college a lot
better than high school.

2545
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:13,562
You kinda find your people
in college, you know?

2546
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,015
Exactly.

2547
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:16,166
You'll be fine.

2548
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,695
You got a good heart, just
follow your heart. Yeah?

2549
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,335
Thanks.
Good luck.

2550
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:22,010
Don't forget to floss.

2551
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,295
I just don't get why you're
being so fucking childish.

2552
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,135
I'm not being childish!

2553
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,527
You're the one who made it into
this big thing by telling everyone!

2554
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,766
I haven't told anyone.

2555
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,490
So Cynthia just magically knows

2556
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:46,095
you're going to the prom
with this loser,

2557
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,610
even though you're not
dating him anymore?

2558
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,015
She's my best friend.

2559
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,805
Well, your best friend
has a big fucking mouth.

2560
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,495
Take it up with her, then.

2561
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,735
Why don't you just
tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw

2562
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:57,285
she can keep on talking,

2563
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:58,975
as long as she
includes the truth,

2564
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,241
which is that we wouldn't
be having this conversation

2565
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:04,529
if your college boyfriend weren't
out of town this weekend.

2566
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:07,090
You had already
bought the tickets.

2567
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:09,495
It's just prom,
it's not like it matters.

2568
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,095
I'm just trying to
be friends with you.

2569
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:14,363
It's just humiliating.
I can't do that.

2570
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:17,855
Mister I-Don't-Care-What-
Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me.

2571
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:19,015
Fuck anyone else!

2572
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,364
I care what I think of me,
which isn't much right now.

2573
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,768
King of the Pity Prom.

2574
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:28,565
Fine. We're not going.

2575
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:30,605
Great.

2576
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,484
Why are we even...

2577
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,375
I mean, we both knew
this was coming.

2578
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,575
I'm just the one
who did something about it.

2579
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,135
Yeah, fucking some college guy.

2580
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,446
Fuck you!

2581
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:55,175
I don't regret anything.

2582
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:57,015
Of course you don't.

2583
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,055
You know, it's actually
kind of a relief

2584
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,560
not to have to be around someone
who's so gloomy all the time.

2585
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:03,775
The world's not so horrible.

2586
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:06,815
Not everything's some big
conspiracy against humanity.

2587
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:08,444
It's great that
you can think that way.

2588
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:13,282
You know, I'm sure dating a jock
really helps to clear the mind.

2589
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:17,527
He's not a jock, okay? He just
happens to be on the lacrosse team.

2590
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,415
We're all going to other
schools next year anyway.

2591
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,735
It's not some
super-serious relationship.

2592
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,922
Great. I feel
so much better now.

2593
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,165
We're just having fun.

2594
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:29,006
I bet he's having fun.

2595
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,486
Grow up, Mason.

2596
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,800
It's not like I haven't
been with anyone else.

2597
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,766
Who?

2598
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:39,487
What do you care?

2599
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,367
Who?

2600
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,161
Does it matter?

2601
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,091
You're the one
who brought it up.

2602
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:54,089
This is pointless.

2603
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,845
Now you're just trying
to be an asshole.

2604
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,975
Holy crap, I would rather
have my balls clawed off

2605
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,241
than ever sit through
anything like that ever again.

2606
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:10,855
Well, you never, ever have to.

2607
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,815
My God, thank you.

2608
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,842
Give me that.
Dude, it's all you.

2609
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,730
Drink up.

2610
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:20,685
So you coming out
with me tonight, brother?

2611
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,335
Should be some pretty
awesome stuff happening.

2612
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:25,775
Naw, dude, I'm going to this
show with my dad in Austin.

2613
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,450
His friend's playing.

2614
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,768
Have fun with that, I guess.

2615
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:36,331
Fuck, there are so many cars here.
I don't wanna go in there!

2616
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,201
Dude, you will have so much fun.

2617
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,855
Your family loves you!
Have a swell time.

2618
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,247
Fuck you.
You're coming in with me.

2619
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,535
No. Shit, no.
Yes.

2620
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:49,722
Yes, you are. My mom loves you.
You have to say hi.

2621
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:53,882
Do you want to hurt her feelings?

2622
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:56,208
Well, then, let's go get 'em!

2623
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,803
Just for a second. Just a
second, seriously.

2624
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,535
You know, you're in sort
of enemy territory here.

2625
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:04,561
We're aware.

2626
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,203
Look who's here!

2627
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,566
Hey!

2628
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,365
Get a job!

2629
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,335
Congratulations!

2630
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,815
No, no, no! Wait.
We're gonna take pictures.

2631
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,444
Put it back on.

2632
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,935
Can you get a camera?

2633
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,415
Congratulations, baby.

2634
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:44,280
I don't know you, but congratulations!

2635
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,606
All right, look here.

2636
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,775
Smile.
Here we go.

2637
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,325
That's a good one.

2638
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,807
And good. Got it.

2639
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,215
We need...
Sam, where are you?

2640
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,446
- Samantha!
- Sam.

2641
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,255
And where's Mason Senior?

2642
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,328
I'm feeling generous.
Come here.

2643
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:06,935
Great.
And beautiful!

2644
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:08,975
I'll email these to everyone.

2645
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,043
Don't even start.
Don't start, don't start.

2646
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,640
Can't believe you guys came all this way.
It means a lot to me.

2647
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:28,684
We wouldn't have
missed it for anything!

2648
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:33,089
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.

2649
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:36,689
I'm really sorry that Lee couldn't be here.
He's on his senior trip.

2650
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,405
No, tell him I said hi.
I will.

2651
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,921
Abby, I didn't even recognize you.
How old are you now?

2652
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,127
I'm 13.

2653
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,600
Wow.

2654
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,367
All right, let's top her off.

2655
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:51,655
You want some, doll?

2656
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:54,375
Um, sure,
whatever. Yeah.

2657
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,640
<i>I got you something.</i>

2658
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,495
What is it?

2659
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,215
That is a savings bond.
That is worth something.

2660
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,040
It's better than money.
You'd just spend that.

2661
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,655
God, is that your mom?

2662
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:09,001
Yeah. Yeah. That's her. Wow.

2663
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:12,611
Three-second rule.
Put it on your plate.

2664
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,335
Such a good dad.
Really.

2665
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,495
I know.
I'm trying to help.

2666
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,880
Come here, you guys. I want to
make a little toast to Mason.

2667
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,655
Now, Mason, I know you didn't
really want to have a party today,

2668
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:24,575
but we did.

2669
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:28,491
And you only graduate high
school once in your life.

2670
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:32,815
So I want to celebrate you
and this next phase.

2671
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:34,535
And you're gonna learn
so much in college,

2672
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:35,695
you're gonna have so much fun.

2673
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,615
You're gonna have
inspiring teachers,

2674
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,895
you're gonna learn more
about your art.

2675
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,809
I love you, babe.
So proud of you.

2676
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,920
- To Mason.
- To Mason!

2677
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:47,967
- To Mason.
- Here, here!

2678
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:52,123
All right, you're up, kid.

2679
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,847
All right... Well, Mason,
I'll make a toast to the future.

2680
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,615
To your future.

2681
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:03,815
You know, it's been
a little sketchy

2682
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,215
this end of
the school year here,

2683
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:07,535
trying to figure out
what school to go to.

2684
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:10,495
Mason told me that he wanted

2685
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,655
to get as far away
from home as possible,

2686
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:15,775
but still honor our agreement
that we pay in-state tuition,

2687
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:17,295
which I do appreciate.

2688
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:20,575
He's a prudent man and,
he's gonna have a great future.

2689
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:21,840
So here's to you, buddy.

2690
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,400
To the future!

2691
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:25,251
Congratulations!

2692
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:31,495
Mason Junior! High school
graduate, 18 and straight!

2693
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,095
Just ignore him. My brother
needs to learn to pace himself.

2694
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:39,203
I've not known you
as long as everybody here,

2695
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:45,771
but since I have known you, you've
grown a lot and I'm proud of you.

2696
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:49,324
So, if this photography
thing doesn't work out,

2697
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:50,495
you know you always got a job.

2698
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,615
Lose that earring. But...

2699
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,775
You know, maybe I can
get you front of house.

2700
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,335
All right.
To you, buddy!

2701
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:00,485
Sam, say something!

2702
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,815
Come on, Samantha.
Um...

2703
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:04,524
Come on, darling.

2704
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,245
Good luck.

2705
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,011
Aw...

2706
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,855
So you broke up
with your girlfriend?

2707
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:19,855
Yeah, yeah, just recently.

2708
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:21,095
What was her name?

2709
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,327
Sheena.

2710
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,975
She's gonna go to
college with you?

2711
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,359
No.
No?

2712
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,362
She's staying in
this part of Texas.

2713
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:30,695
Okay.

2714
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,210
You need a ride to college?

2715
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,495
I just wanted to say hello
before you got out of here.

2716
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,655
You guys met before, haven't you?
Annie, Aunt Jen?

2717
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,255
Yeah, we met at...

2718
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,815
Sam's graduation.
Yeah.

2719
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:44,495
And with your little one.
Where is he?

2720
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:46,887
He's at home.

2721
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,015
Remember? He was such a
pain in Sam's thing that...

2722
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,975
I would love to see him.

2723
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,048
We have a special weekend
this weekend, so...

2724
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,375
I'm so glad you
found her, I really am.

2725
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,575
You've got him at
a good time, I think.

2726
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,495
I think so, too.
Yeah.

2727
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,815
It's good to see you two.

2728
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:02,015
Nice to see you, too, Jen.

2729
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:03,455
So proud of your boy.

2730
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:05,369
Yeah. Yeah,
we all are.

2731
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:10,801
She's a bitch and a half.

2732
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:13,615
You got to
remember, you're going

2733
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,095
to college, though, all right?

2734
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,135
And if you're anything
like me or your old man,

2735
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:20,535
you're gonna be pulling
down some serious wool.

2736
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,535
You're gonna be tapping
some masterful gap.

2737
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,175
You're gonna be doing
some good work out there.

2738
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,567
Think about it. Awful lot
of flowers in that bouquet.

2739
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,215
But you got to do me a favor.

2740
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,375
You're going to be vulnerable
this summer, all right?

2741
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:33,404
Remember to use protection
during breakup sex.

2742
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:37,975
This guy knows exactly of which I speak.

2743
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,571
Look what
happened to him. <i>Voila'.</i>

2744
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:42,091
Steven.

2745
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,925
Cheers.

2746
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,775
It's not that simple.

2747
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:50,485
Four more years.
Four more years.

2748
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,650
I'm just saying.

2749
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:57,735
Do y'all recycle?
Should I...

2750
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,055
I have one started there.

2751
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,321
Yeah, right. Great.

2752
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,401
Am I your only ex at this party?

2753
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:10,770
Yes. I'm not your
only wife here, though.

2754
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,360
Yeah.

2755
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:19,923
Can you believe they're
both out of high school?

2756
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,811
No. No, I can't.

2757
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,807
You did a great job with
both of them, by the way.

2758
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,203
Thanks for saying that.

2759
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,095
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

2760
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,326
Well, it's true.

2761
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:36,205
Thank you.

2762
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:39,655
You're doing it all over again?

2763
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:41,603
I know, I know, right?

2764
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:45,966
It's gonna be 15 years
till I have an empty nest.

2765
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,968
But I'd love to pitch in,
help with this, if I could.

2766
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,889
I mean, it's so great
that you did this.

2767
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,082
Can I just give you a little?

2768
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:56,935
I'd appreciate it if I could.

2769
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,575
Sure. Yeah.

2770
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:00,135
But I don't have any cash.

2771
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:03,607
I know, it's in Annie's purse.
I'll be right back.

2772
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,655
So it sucks. I mean, the guy's
a college lacrosse player.

2773
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:15,135
What are you gonna do?

2774
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,495
She didn't even like sports.

2775
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:18,895
You want a beer?

2776
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,175
No, that's all right.

2777
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,725
You can have one.
It's okay.

2778
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,335
Yeah, well, for what it's worth,

2779
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:28,524
we've all been through the exact
same thing at one point or another.

2780
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,855
It's not the same, though. I
mean, you never got to know her.

2781
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:34,565
No, I know, I know.
It's not the same.

2782
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:37,335
I just don't know
what I did wrong.

2783
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:39,647
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, man.

2784
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,729
Hey.
Hey, Mason.

2785
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:45,650
We're up here raiding the green room.
Hope that's okay.

2786
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,895
That's totally cool.

2787
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:47,921
All right.

2788
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,375
Wow! Is that MJ?

2789
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:55,004
Right?

2790
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:56,884
Unbelievable.

2791
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:00,095
Well, we just decided to come a
little early, check you out.

2792
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,575
That's cool man, let me finish up.
I'll be up in a minute.

2793
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:05,444
All right. I guarantee you,
you didn't do anything wrong.

2794
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,082
These high school love
things, they never work out.

2795
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,415
Here, come here.

2796
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:12,775
I mean, everybody's just
changing so much, you know?

2797
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,327
The odds of two young people staying
on the same wavelength are...

2798
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:19,095
Yeah, but still... Look,
and I also guarantee you

2799
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,495
that every day of your life

2800
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:22,615
that you spend crying
over some silly girl

2801
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:25,535
is a complete waste of time.

2802
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:27,175
She wasn't a silly girl, though.

2803
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,295
I mean, she's a serious person.

2804
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,215
And I really thought we were...

2805
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:32,415
What?

2806
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,408
I don't know.

2807
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,600
Here's the truth. Women
are never satisfied, okay?

2808
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,575
They're always looking
to potentially trade up,

2809
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:42,055
and that's, I'm sorry to say,

2810
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:44,495
what I think has happened to
you, my fine-feathered friend.

2811
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:46,055
What does that even mean?

2812
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:49,575
It means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.

2813
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:50,935
Sheena.
All right.

2814
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:52,895
It means you are
responsible for you,

2815
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:55,895
not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me, you.

2816
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,415
And if you truly
take care of you,

2817
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,295
you will be amazed at
how much girls like Sheena

2818
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,641
start lining up
at your front door.

2819
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:05,327
Great.

2820
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:08,575
You just gotta separate yourself
from the pack in some way.

2821
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:12,525
Excel at something, you know, and
then you have your pick of the litter

2822
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:15,055
when the front-runner hussies
start sniffing around.

2823
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,651
So what you're saying
is I should take up lacrosse.

2824
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:19,615
Exactly.

2825
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:21,483
Or you could,
you know, start a band.

2826
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:25,480
Worked for me a long time ago. I
think it's still working for Jimmy.

2827
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,171
Or you just
keep taking pictures.

2828
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:31,007
She hated the pictures
I took of her.

2829
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:32,935
I'm sick to death of her, okay?

2830
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:36,335
I only met her a few times, and
yes, she was cute, all right,

2831
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:39,095
but truth be told, I always
thought she was a little bit...

2832
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:41,255
You know, a little
bit too square for you.

2833
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,775
You know,
not quite the same vibe.

2834
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:44,935
You really thought that?

2835
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,689
On some subtle, lower level.

2836
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,575
I mean, I wasn't surprised

2837
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:54,895
when it turned out she was interested in
some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

2838
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,767
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things, you know.

2839
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,535
I mean, take your mom and me.

2840
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,575
I think I probably
turned into the boring,

2841
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,329
castrated guy
she wanted me to be

2842
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,655
15, 20 years ago, you know?

2843
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,975
I'm not saying she was wrong
to be pissed, I'm not.

2844
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,655
I'm just saying
that she could've been

2845
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,615
a little more patient,
little more forgiving.

2846
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,291
Would've saved me that
parade of drunken assholes.

2847
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,686
So, what's the point?

2848
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,526
Of what?

2849
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:35,051
I don't know,
any of this. Everything.

2850
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:39,135
Everything?
What's the point?

2851
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:41,731
I mean,
I sure as shit don't know.

2852
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:44,095
Neither does anybody else, okay?

2853
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:46,726
We're all just
winging it, you know?

2854
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,855
The good news is
you're feeling stuff.

2855
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,645
And you've got to
hold on to that.

2856
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:55,335
You do. I mean, you get older
and you don't feel as much.

2857
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,175
Your skin gets tougher.

2858
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,735
The point is those
pictures you took,

2859
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:02,651
thousands of submissions from all
over the state, and you won.

2860
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,929
Well, I got silver.

2861
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:07,335
And nine other people did, too.
I'm gonna kill you.

2862
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,735
I'm trying to tell you
that I believe in you, Mason.

2863
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:11,175
I think you're really special,

2864
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,567
and if some girl doesn't see
that, then fuck her, you know.

2865
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:18,528
Hey, this next one of 'em goes
out to a young man in the house.

2866
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:21,684
Whoo-hoo! Known him since
he was just a small boy.

2867
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:26,329
Now he's all graduated from high
school and making me feel old.

2868
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:30,366
Happy high school
graduation, Mason.

2869
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:59,131
Thank you.

2870
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,615
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna
break this into four categories.

2871
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:05,935
One, anything you want to
keep from your childhood

2872
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,295
and you're taking with you.

2873
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:11,405
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.

2874
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:13,935
And four, whatever you
want to try to sell

2875
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,455
at the garage sale next weekend,

2876
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,721
whatever we don't sell,
we're donating.

2877
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:22,245
Doesn't the apartment have like an
attic, or storage or something?

2878
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:24,887
No. You're missing the point.

2879
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:28,170
We're not gonna drag a bunch of
crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

2880
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:30,775
Can't believe
we're moving again.

2881
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,215
No, I'm moving.

2882
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,005
You moved two years ago. You
have an apartment in Austin.

2883
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,243
Mason is moving in the fall.

2884
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,255
I'm done.

2885
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,495
This'll be great for me.
I'll have all these options.

2886
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,215
I could take a sabbatical.

2887
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:45,695
I could get some writing done,
try to get published.

2888
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,815
What about Christmas, though?
What are we gonna do?

2889
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,775
I'm not sharing a room with him.

2890
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,535
One of you will
sleep on the couch,

2891
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:53,688
and we'll use that
blow-up mattress.

2892
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:56,322
How am I supposed
to do my laundry?

2893
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:00,084
Sam, I'm gently
pushing you out of the nest.

2894
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,095
And on your way down, you may
magically find some quarters

2895
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,691
that you use to do laundry
in your own apartment.

2896
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,362
Come on!
You guys are adults!

2897
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,366
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?

2898
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,135
I'm gonna get the veggie burger.

2899
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:21,242
I'm not having anything,
not hungry.

2900
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,769
What's wrong with you?

2901
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,371
I'm sick.

2902
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:29,004
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?

2903
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,242
She's pregnant.

2904
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,686
No. To be honest, I drank
way too much last night.

2905
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,768
You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.

2906
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:41,295
Cary's back home, too,
and we just hung out.

2907
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:45,175
You know, peach Smirnoffs,
they just go down so easy.

2908
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:48,255
No, no. Hey,
that's not an excuse.

2909
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:50,095
You can still pack boxes.

2910
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:53,095
These people want to move in
as soon as possible.

2911
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,600
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?

2912
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,295
You probably don't remember me,

2913
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:00,495
but I worked on your
septic line years ago.

2914
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,567
Yeah.

2915
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:04,455
Believe it or not,
you changed my life.

2916
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,775
You told me that day
that I was smart

2917
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,768
and that I should go to school.

2918
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,970
I took your advice. I signed
up for English classes,

2919
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,135
and then a year later,
I went to community college

2920
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,415
and I got my Associate's degree,

2921
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:17,575
and I'm working on my
bachelor's now at Texas State.

2922
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,090
And also one of
the managers here.

2923
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:20,446
That's great.

2924
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,295
It's good to see you,
because I really wanted

2925
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,975
a chance to thank you for that.

2926
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,480
<i>Gracias.</i> It really
meant a lot to me.

2927
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:33,087
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me.
It's the least I can do.

2928
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,604
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.

2929
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,611
Thank you.

2930
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,215
Isn't that kind
of crazy, though,

2931
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,775
that a computer
knows who you are

2932
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:58,615
from just 20 questions
off a form?

2933
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,895
I guess there are really only like
eight types of people in the world.

2934
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:04,082
I mean, there are subsets
like male and female,

2935
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:08,000
but apparently we're not as unique
as we want to think we are.

2936
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,168
Have you even
talked to this guy yet?

2937
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:13,775
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.

2938
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:16,770
He's studying
literature and anthropology

2939
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,089
and he's way into Bright Eyes,
so that's not so bad.

2940
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:22,295
But, anyways, he was
telling me about how

2941
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:26,135
the system they use for assigning
roommates is kinda spooky.

2942
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,255
The freshman satisfaction rate for
new roommates used to be like 60%,

2943
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:33,284
and now it's 100,
just 'cause of the computer.

2944
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:36,883
Well, sounds like he'll be
a good roommate, then.

2945
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,975
Yeah. But we
pretty much decided

2946
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,335
that soon they won't even
need a questionnaire

2947
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:45,695
'cause they'll just let the
NSA scan your digital ghost

2948
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,735
and they'll tell you
who your roommate is

2949
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,367
based on everything you've
ever said, written or clicked.

2950
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,815
Did you put this in here again?

2951
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,815
I don't want it.

2952
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:59,571
Come on, it's the first
picture you ever took.

2953
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:03,524
All the more reason to
leave it behind, right?

2954
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:22,207
What?
Nothing.

2955
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,488
No, what is it?
It's nothing!

2956
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:26,927
Mom.

2957
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,766
This is the worst
day of my life.

2958
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,575
What're you talking about?

2959
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,855
I knew this day was coming.

2960
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,135
I didn't know you were gonna be

2961
02:32:37,160 --> 02:32:38,924
so fuckin' happy to be leaving.

2962
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:43,641
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
What do you expect?

2963
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:47,289
You know what I'm realizing? My
life is just gonna go, like that.

2964
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,568
This series of milestones.

2965
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:53,242
Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.

2966
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,815
The time that we thought
you were dyslexic.

2967
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,365
When I taught you
how to ride a bike.

2968
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:01,735
Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.

2969
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:03,655
Finally getting
the job I wanted.

2970
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,082
Sending Samantha off to college.
Sending you off to college.

2971
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,415
You know what's next?

2972
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:11,442
It's my fuckin' funeral!

2973
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:15,608
Just go!
And leave my picture!

2974
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:21,601
Aren't you jumping ahead by,
like, 40 years or something?

2975
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,284
I just thought
there would be more.

2976
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,841
Hey, you must be Mason.

2977
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:46,087
Yeah. Dalton, right?

2978
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,495
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
Definitely.

2979
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:50,090
Are you cool with
this side of the room?

2980
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:51,375
Yeah.

2981
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,935
Got in this morning,
just moved my shit in, man.

2982
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:57,015
Well, yeah, I don't care.
No worries.

2983
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,415
Cool. Can I help you
with anything, man?

2984
02:35:58,440 --> 02:35:59,695
Any bags, any of that
stuff need brought in?

2985
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:03,255
I just got like one box left,
I packed pretty light.

2986
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,535
But I appreciate it.

2987
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,840
It's my pleasure, man.
Of course.

2988
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:11,284
Um... Are you going to
the orientation mixer thing?

2989
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:15,095
Orientation mixer thing?

2990
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,775
Fuck no, man,
I'm not going to that,

2991
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,006
and neither are you, by the way.

2992
02:36:18,007 --> 02:36:20,480
We got way better stuff to
be doing, dude. All right.

2993
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,935
You ready?
Yeah.

2994
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,255
Hey, Barb, this is my roommate Mason.
Mason, Barb.

2995
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,327
- Hi.
- Hey.

2996
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,761
You coming with us?

2997
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,287
Where're you going?

2998
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,775
Hiking. Yeah, man,
you should come.

2999
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,735
If we leave now we can catch the
late afternoon at Big Bend.

3000
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:33,895
You ever been before, man?

3001
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,695
Yeah, but not since
I was really little.

3002
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:39,964
Then all the more reason to come now, man.
That's why we're here, dude.

3003
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:43,527
Mason, this is
Nicole, Barb's roommate.

3004
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:45,167
Hey, what's up?

3005
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:47,775
Hi.
Mason, Nicole.

3006
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,801
So, you game?

3007
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,241
Sure.

3008
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,803
Here, have the rest of this.

3009
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:57,255
Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick
in when we get in the mountains.

3010
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:58,930
Awesome. Let's go.

3011
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,215
Do they let you
major in that here?

3012
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:12,415
Well, it's not that serious here, so
I kinda train outside of university,

3013
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:15,455
but I'm taking all my basics like
History of Dance and all that.

3014
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,289
Nice.
Yeah.

3015
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,091
What do you teach?

3016
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,440
Gosh.

3017
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:24,209
Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop.
Wow...

3018
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,295
Which one's your favorite?

3019
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,455
Tap.

3020
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,575
Yeah?
Yeah.

3021
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:33,015
You get to like make up all your
own sounds, and there's no rules.

3022
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,455
Just like creative freedom.

3023
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:36,175
That's great.
Yeah.

3024
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:37,815
That's why I love
teaching it, 'cause,

3025
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,455
I don't know,
it's so beautiful to me,

3026
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,895
and it's kind of dying
away in this generation,

3027
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,295
so, to be a part
of bringing it back

3028
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,575
to the kids is really rewarding.

3029
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,895
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.

3030
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,921
How old are they?

3031
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,655
Six to eight.
Wow.

3032
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:52,287
Yeah. They have no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

3033
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,448
They haven't reached
the awkward years yet.

3034
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,722
Yeah, not yet. It's coming.

3035
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:14,095
Hey.

3036
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:15,565
Hey.

3037
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,287
Dalton can be crazy sometimes.

3038
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:30,445
He seems cool, though.

3039
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:33,251
Yeah. Yeah,
they're both really cool.

3040
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,569
How are you feeling?

3041
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:43,922
Great. Pretty great,
to be honest.

3042
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:46,606
Good.

3043
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:51,895
I'm really happy that
you're hangin' out with us.

3044
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:54,605
Yeah. Me, too.

3045
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:59,129
This moment's
having a falsieful whoregasm!

3046
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,375
It's like as if all of time
has unfolded before us

3047
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:06,121
so we could stand here and look
out and scream, "Fuck, yeah!"

3048
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:16,650
You know how everyone's always
saying, "Seize the moment"?

3049
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:22,971
I don't know, I'm kinda thinking
it's the other way around.

3050
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:26,655
You know, like,
the moment seizes us.

3051
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:29,331
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

3052
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:33,608
It's constant.
The moment, it's just...

3053
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:37,644
It's like it's always
right now, you know?

3054
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,805
Yeah.
