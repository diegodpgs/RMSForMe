1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,569
<i>Antarctica.</i>

2
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,084
<i>An inhospitable wasteland.</i>

3
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,127
<i>But even here,
on the earth's frozen bottom...</i>

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,362
<i>we find life.</i>

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,884
<i>And not just any life.</i>

6
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,283
<i>Penguins!</i>

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,690
<i>Joyous, frolicking, waddling,
cute and cuddly life.</i>

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,691
<i>Look at them...</i>

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,207
<i>tumbling onto their chubby bum-bums.</i>

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,131
<i>Who could take these
frisky little snow clowns...</i>

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,560
Seriously?

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,121
Does anyone even know
where we're marching to?

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,328
- Who cares?
- I question nothing.

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,527
- Me, too.
- Me, too!

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,522
Well, fine!

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,604
We'll just fly to the front of the line
and see for ourselves.

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,003
Kowalski! Rico!
Engage aerial surveillance.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,849
Here we go!
Doing it! Come on!

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,128
Skipper, we appear to be flightless.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,611
Well, what's the point of these?

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,009
I like it!
Hey, this could be our thing!

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,841
What are we gonna call it?
Let's call it the "high one."

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,121
Hey, did anybody see that?
That's an egg!

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,446
Is someone gonna go get it?

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,806
We can't do that.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,802
Why not?

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Well, it's a dangerous world out there,
and we're just penguins.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,127
You know, nothing but cute and cuddly.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,841
Yeah! Why do you think there are always
documentary crews filming us?

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,410
Well, sorry, kid.
We lose a few eggs every year.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,641
It's just nature.

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,808
Oh, right. Nature.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,042
I guess that makes sense...

34
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,609
but something deep down in my gut
tells me that it makes no sense at all.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,331
You know what?
I reject nature!

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,169
Who's with me?

37
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,208
The old ship.
No one's ever returned from there alive.

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Relax, Kowalski.
There's a bird down there now.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,325
Look, he's fine.

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,485
Leopard seals.
Nature's snakes.

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,483
Aren't snakes "nature's snakes"?

42
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,450
How should I know?
I live on the flipping frozen tundra!

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,171
They're going for the egg!
Give me a way down there, ASAP!

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,210
All one would have to do
is collect 300 feet of kelp...

45
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,328
Tiny and helpless,
the baby penguins are frozen with fear.

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,208
They know if they fall from this cliff,
they will surely die.

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,006
Gunter, give them a shove.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,040
...harnessing the jellyfish we've trained
to obey simple voice commands.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,811
Now, that's more like it!

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,046
That-a-boy, Rico!

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,725
Don't let them have it!

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,042
Okay!
I guess that works.

53
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,690
Get to high ground!

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,841
Booyah!

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,206
Success!

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,731
I'd recommend firing it now!

57
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,881
Nope. Hold on.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,246
We really should fire it!

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,448
Not till we see the white of its eyes.

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,762
They're mostly pupil.
Very little white! Almost none!

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
They gotta have a little bit of white,
right?

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,568
None whatsoever!

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,922
What if they look really far
to the left?

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,251
Fire in the hole!

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,531
Kowalski, analysis?

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,369
We are really awesome at this!

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,771
Boys, we did it!
Mission accomplished.

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,764
Hey, we could do our thing!
High one!

69
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,926
Yes!

70
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
My bad!

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,806
Look, it's the miracle of birth!

72
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,005
A moment of extraordinary beauty.

73
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,170
That's disgusting!
I think I have amniotic sac in my mouth!

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,964
Hello!
Are you my family?

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,006
You don't have a family,
and we're all going to die. Sorry.

76
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
What?

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,491
What? I thought that was what
we were all nodding about.

78
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,529
No one's gonna die!

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,846
Know what you've got, kid?

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,331
You've got us.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,244
We've got each other.

82
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,843
If that ain't a family,
I don't know what is.

83
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,010
So adorable.

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,401
Kowalski, what's our trajectory?

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,608
95% certain we're still doomed.

86
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,603
And the other 5%?

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,446
Adventure and glory
like no penguins have ever seen before.

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,045
I'll take that action.

89
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,531
But where are we going?

90
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,410
The future, boys.

91
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,691
The glorious future.

92
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,046
That song!

93
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,771
I swear, it's gonna make me
lose my salmon.

94
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,410
Singing getting louder, Skipper.

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,921
Then move faster!

96
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
And somebody get
that wig off Private!

97
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,410
Kowalski, status report!

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,483
I am really getting
tired of this song.

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,722
Well, the best part
of owning a circus...

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,888
is you can transport a cannon
over state lines.

101
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,570
Ten years ago, on this very day,
a tiny egg hatched...

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,411
and our world got a little bit cuter.

103
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,005
So, tonight, Private,
we celebrate your birthday...

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,403
by infiltrating
the United States gold depository...

105
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,166
at Fort Knox!

106
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,361
Splendid!

107
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,841
- What?
- There she is, boys!

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,446
The object of our unholy desire...

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,931
the butter on our biscuit...

110
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,286
- the royal flush...
- Skipper?

111
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,171
Private, what's our rule
about interrupting analogies?

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,651
Sorry.
Please continue.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,087
The moment's gone.
Private ruined it.

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,730
Sir, we're approaching our target.

115
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,722
But, Skipper, I really don't...

116
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,888
Are you questioning
my leadership, Private?

117
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,929
- No, sir.
- Too bad.

118
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,121
Because I respect a soldier
with some moxie.

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,606
Really?
Then I really think we should...

120
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,446
Whoa, whoa!
Dial back the moxie, sass-mouth!

121
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,247
Look at you.
Still so adorable.

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Fire in the hole!

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,766
<i>Eight o'clock.
Night-night time!</i>

124
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,081
What?

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,489
Private, come on!

126
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,805
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

127
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,166
Kowalski, you're up.

128
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

129
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,124
Rico, sonic incursion device.

130
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,884
Oh, come on.
You're kidding, right?

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,487
Kentucky, Skipper.
They do love their Flatt and Scruggs.

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,371
<i>Y'all come in now, you hear?
Have yourself an ice tea.</i>

133
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,765
Private, if you could have anything
you wanted in the whole wide world...

134
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,121
what would it be?

135
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Well, gee, Skipper.

136
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,130
I think to be a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

137
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,884
Oh, well, we got you something else.

138
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,761
A vending machine?

139
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,843
Not just any vending machine, Private.

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,447
The last remaining home
in America's nanny state...

141
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,481
for those succulent,
but chemically hazardous bits of puffed heaven called...

142
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,369
Cheezy Dibbles!

143
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,723
Happy ding-dong birthday,
you little scamp.

144
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,371
Thank you!

145
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,528
You mess with the bull,
you're gonna get the horns, Private.

146
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,331
Now hit that machine
and get your present.

147
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,289
We just broke into the most secure facility
in North America.

148
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,646
You know what that means?

149
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,440
We're wanted criminals who'll be
on the lam the rest of our lives...

150
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,840
always feeling the hot breath
of Johnny Law on our necks?

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,921
No! It means, as elite units go,
we're the elitist of the elite.

152
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,404
Top shelf in the bureau.
The penultimate, plus one.

153
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,771
Where'd Private go?

154
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,889
There he is.
D-3.

155
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,923
Oh, Private. How much is he?

156
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,849
He's $3.50, sir.

157
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,691
That's outrageous.
Even for Private.

158
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,207
Sir, the machine is alive!

159
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,323
I don't think I like your attitude,
vending machine.

160
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,766
Or your prices!

161
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,081
Release them!

162
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
What the...?

163
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,406
Kowalski, analysis!

164
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,847
All evidence indicates...

165
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,047
I ate too many Cheezy Dibbles.

166
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,563
We're behind enemy lines
and incredibly thirsty.

167
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,564
Rico, bust us out
of this delicious prison.

168
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Nice work, Rico!

169
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,606
You are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

170
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,962
Private, quit lollygagging.
And regular gagging.

171
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,689
Dark and ominous.

172
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,366
Two of my least favorite traits
in a room.

173
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,647
Look!
A button.

174
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,961
Private, don't!

175
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,924
Now, what have I told you about...

176
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,161
Sorry, what?

177
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,041
It looks like some sort of giant laser
sent to kill us all, sir.

178
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,249
Another one!

179
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
No!

180
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,482
What the...?

181
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,971
Naughty, naughty!

182
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,606
Pretty birds belong in their cages.

183
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,211
Now, that's just hurtful.

184
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,328
And I was so happy to see you again.

185
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,207
Skipper, Kowalski, Rico...

186
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,891
and sweet little Private.

187
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,485
Who are you?

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,962
The humans know me
as Doctor Octavius Brine...

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,205
renowned geneticist,
cheese enthusiast...

190
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,126
and frequent donor to NPR pledge drives.

191
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,565
But you know me by a different,
much older name.

192
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,964
A name perhaps you'd hoped
you'd never hear again.

193
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,246
A phantom!

194
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,564
A shadow of a former life.

195
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
L...

196
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
am...

197
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,608
Dave!

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,842
Kowalski?

199
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,604
Sorry, sir. No clue.

200
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,164
Dave!

201
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,362
- Dave!
- Dave?

202
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,681
Dave!

203
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Dave.

204
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,086
Dave!

205
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,846
Sorry.

206
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,203
Wait, wait.
I live this way.

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,365
Go ahead, Dan.
Continue.

208
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,205
You seriously don't remember me?

209
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,886
Dave! Dave! Right!
Oh, yeah, long time!

210
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
How's the wife?

211
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,242
I've never been married!

212
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,882
You may not remember me...

213
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,850
but I could never forget you.

214
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,880
Let's shake up some old memories.

215
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,767
New York City.

216
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,764
<i>The Central Park Zoo.
Life was good.</i>

217
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,401
<i>Roomy tank...</i>

218
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,284
<i>great location...</i>

219
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,127
<i>monkey-house views.</i>

220
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,926
<i>And, of course...</i>

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,801
<i>my adoring legion of fans!</i>

222
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Cool!

223
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,087
<i>Dave!</i>

224
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,403
<i>The octopus of a thousand tricks.</i>

225
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,408
Awesome!

226
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,602
<i>I was the total package.</i>

227
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,602
Wow!

228
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,283
Hey. Kids!

229
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,642
You gotta see this!
Get up here, quick!

230
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,929
<i>And then, you arrived.</i>

231
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,327
They're so adorable!

232
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,768
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

233
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,605
<i>And took everything from me.</i>

234
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,282
- They are so adorable.
- Have you ever seen anything cuter?

235
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,651
<i>Four adorable baby penguins.</i>

236
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,961
<i>With you around...</i>

237
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,408
<i>no one wanted an old octopus anymore.</i>

238
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,127
<i>"Out you go, Dave!"</i>

239
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,931
<i>And so it went, over and over...</i>

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,446
<i>at zoo after aquarium.</i>

241
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,244
I can't see the penguins, man!

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,641
<i>Adorable penguins stole the show.</i>

243
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,169
<i>While I was shunned.</i>

244
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,130
<i>Forgotten.</i>

245
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,524
<i>Unwanted.</i>

246
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,049
Alone.

247
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,642
That sounds awful!

248
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,047
Oh, it was.

249
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,202
I came to realize, some creatures
are born to get all the love.

250
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,045
The rest of us get nothing.

251
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,170
The only thing that has kept me going
all these years...

252
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,803
is my burning thirst for revenge!

253
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,131
And my precious
souvenir snow globe collection.

254
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,889
What is wrong with you?

255
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,728
Daryl, Daryl, Daryl,
you can't blame us for what happened to you.

256
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,129
Can!
That's how this whole revenge thing works!

257
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,207
And with this,
I finally have the power to destroy you!

258
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,600
Crikey!

259
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
Nicolas, cage them.

260
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,006
I've got some bad news for you, Dennis.

261
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,889
You messed with the wrong birds.

262
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,328
Because we are an elite unit,
the best of the best.

263
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,528
The cream of the
corn on a platinum cob!

264
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,720
And we're gonna take your deadly green
goop and sashay right out the exit hatch.

265
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,850
And just how are you going to do that?

266
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,089
Deploy secret weapon!

267
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,730
The cheese, it burns!

268
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,686
Roll out!

269
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,290
After them!

270
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,691
All right, boys, it's just like Cuba!

271
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,604
Taxi!

272
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,011
How about some music?
Something chase-y!

273
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Here they come!

274
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,001
Let's move!

275
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,443
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke again!
Stroke some more!

276
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,408
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

277
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,403
Sorry!

278
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,805
We've got baddies, six o'clock!

279
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,128
Kowalski, battle formation!

280
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,646
So, you squeegees
wanna do the gondola mambo?

281
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Let's dance!

282
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,965
Mother of pearl, that stings!
I've lost visual!

283
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,491
Kowalski, be my eyes!

284
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,402
Left!

285
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,483
Right, right! Up!

286
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,166
Duck!

287
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
I think I got them.

288
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,601
They are down, sir.

289
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,171
<i>Excelente!</i>

290
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,243
Skipper!

291
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,971
They're back up,
and we are running out of canal!

292
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,804
Parker Posey! Go all-terrain.

293
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,965
Will you marry... What?

294
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,366
We've lost Engine One!

295
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,931
And Two and Three!

296
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Four!

297
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,691
Switch to emergency power!

298
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,251
Aye-aye, Skipper!

299
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,648
We've got melons!
Dead ahead!

300
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,325
I can see!
Rico, the glowy thing!

301
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,001
Venetian blinded again!

302
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,522
We've been boarded!

303
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,960
Initiate self-destruct sequence!

304
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Nice!

305
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,886
Frankly, I'm surprised
we had a self-destruct sequence.

306
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,091
All right, boys, battle stance!

307
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,288
We're in battle stance, sir.

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,451
Okay, good.
Now, we spring our trap.

309
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,966
I'm not sure they're the ones
that are trapped, sir.

310
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,170
Kowalski, remember our little talk about
true, but unhelpful, comments?

311
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Yes, sir.

312
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
Sometimes we just have to wing it!

313
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Wow.

314
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,405
Sorry for underestimating
the plan, Skipper.

315
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,803
It's okay, Kowalski.
Just don't ever doubt me again.

316
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,764
Now what the heck is going on?

317
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,005
Remain calm, penguins.

318
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,521
You are now under the protection
of the North Wind.

319
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,570
You're welcome.

320
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,525
Oh, my gosh!

321
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,762
You guys are so cute!

322
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,445
You're just so cute!

323
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,922
And cuddly!

324
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,487
Hey, get away!
No more hugs!

325
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,166
It's like being licked
by a basket full of puppy dogs.

326
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Corporal!

327
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,602
Corporal! Chart a course
back to North Wind headquarters.

328
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,247
Eva, inform them
that we're bringing in witnesses.

329
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,368
Private, Dibble me.

330
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,771
We're not going
anywhere with you.

331
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,287
We don't even know
who the heck you are!

332
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,647

334
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,286
An elite undercover interspecies...

Dedicated to helping...

339
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,000
Dedicated to helping animals who can't
help themselves.

340
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,691
Like penguins.

341
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,405
Really?
And you are?

342
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,641
My name is classified.

343
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,605
"Classified," eh?
What is that, Dutch?

344
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,960
Can't really hear the accent.

345
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,451
- Excuse me?
- There's the accent!

346
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,005
My name isn't "Classified."

347
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,960
My name is classified,
because I am the leader of this strike team.

348
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
The seal is Short Fuse,
weapons and explosives.

349
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,842
The bear is Corporal, he's our muscle.

350
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,890
And the owl is Eva,
intelligence and analysis.

351
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,204
Well, Agent Classified,
we happen to be an elite unit, too.

352
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,328
<i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

353
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,320
You know,
you should really label these things.

354
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,249
In three... two... one...

355
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,327
The name's Skipper.
I run this outfit.

356
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Back there is Kowalski.

357
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,723
He's the brains of our operation.

358
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,331
Say something smart, Kowalski.

359
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,360
See?
He's working on a whole other level.

360
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
And Rico.

361
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,130
He's our demolition expert.

362
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,610
He destroyed that chair
for the sheer fun of it.

363
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,966
No reason at all.

364
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,043
And then there's Private.

365
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,122
He's sort of our, you know...

366
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,368
<i>secretary/mascot.</i>

367
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,768
- Cute.
- And cuddly.

368
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,851
Oh, sorry.

369
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,651
Well, let's see how well
"cute and cuddly" handles this next bit.

370
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,963
Nice doggy door.

371
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,569
Wow!

372
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,685
Look at this!

373
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,604
Well, well, well.

374
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,445
Not a bad place
you got here, Classified.

375
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,489
Thank you.
That's not my name.

376
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,047
<i>Arrival, Pad 17.</i>

377
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,482
All right, tiny penguins.

378
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,565
The best way for the North Wind to
protect helpless animals like yourselves...

379
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,290
is to bring Dr. Brine to justice.

380
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,680
Now, you were inside his sub...

381
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,768
so I need to know everything you know.

382
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Hey!

383
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,725
Just tell me everything you know.

384
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
All right.

385
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
<i>Numero uno.</i>

386
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,443
Never trust a Dutchman in a tulip fight.

387
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,726
"Tulip fight."

388
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,882
Canada is secretly training
an army of sasquatch.

389
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,723
"Sasquatch."

390
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,043
Hot dogs are, in fact,
only 17% actual dog.

391
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,087
Not "everything" everything!

392
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,006
Just everything regarding your abduction
by Dr. Octavius Brine.

393
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,930
- Why didn't you say so?
- What?

394
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,811
My team has uncovered
that Dr. Octavius Brine...

395
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,691
is actually an individual
known as Derek!

396
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,286
- "Dave".
- As Dave, the octopus.

397
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,726
An octopus?

398
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,645
No, Dr. Brine is not an octopus.
He is...

399
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,723
An octopus. Precisely.

400
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,969
That's exactly what our intel indicated.

401
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,281
Release the sheep.

402
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,126
What you, of course,
could not know...

403
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,888
is that Dr. Brine's laboratory in Venice is
secretly developing a doomsday weapon...

404
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,169
called the "Medusa Serum."

405
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,131
But what you don't know...

406
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,486
- is that Dirk...
- "Dave."

407
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,927
...Dave won't be using his
Bazooka Serum...

408
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,447
- "Medusa Serum."
- ...Medusa Serum on anybody.

409
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
That part is accurate.

410
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,324
Show him, Rico!

411
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,762
You stole the Medusa Serum?

412
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,288
Well, "Stole the serum,"
"Saved the day," "Did your job for you."

413
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,010
Call it what you will.

414
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,522
Debbie!

415
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,170
- "Dave."
- Dave!

416
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,005
He hacked into our system.

417
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,567
Where's the sound?

418
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,721
Dave!

419
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,609
- Your microphone, it's not on.
- I can't hear anything.

420
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,330
Click on the button
with the picture of the microphone.

421
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,369
Every time a villain calls in,
this happens.

422
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,766
<i>Hello?
Hello?</i>

423
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,888
Now we can hear you,
but we cannot see you.

424
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,882
Every time!

425
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,320
It's like talking to my parents.

426
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,686
<i>How about now?</i>

427
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,806
Yes, we've got you.

428
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,724
<i>Excellent.
Now where was I?</i>

429
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,571
Dave!

430
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,130
<i>Greetings, North Wind.</i>

431
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,760
<i>I see you've met
my old zoo-mates.</i>

432
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,924
We were never "mates."
There was no mating.

433
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,645
Turn yourself in, David.

434
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,804
You're powerless now that I've stolen
your precious Medusa Serum.

435
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,047
You?
You didn't steal that!

436
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,201
It's over.

437
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,805
<i>It's over?</i>

438
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,282
<i>Then why did I call you?</i>

439
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,720
<i>Weird.</i>

440
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,202
<i>Oh! Maybe it was to show you this!</i>

441
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,530
That is a lot of serum
for four penguins.

442
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,486
<i>Oh, you thought
this was just about you four?</i>

443
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,847
<i>No! No, no, no.</i>

444
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,287
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

445
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,281
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go do some shopping...</i>

446
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,329
<i>for revenge!</i>

447
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,563
<i>Wait. How do you...?</i>

448
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,567
<i>What do I push?</i>

449
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,964
<i>Is it the red, or...</i>

450
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,329
<i>I thought it was the... It's not this...</i>

451
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,041
Incoming alert!

452
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Put it on the screen.

453
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,321
The Berlin Zoo. 15 penguins missing.

454
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,130
Dave is kidnapping other penguins!

455
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,248
No doubt cute and cuddly!

456
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,442
We have to move!

457
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,203
What?

458
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,930
- Time for our A-game!
- Everybody, huddle up!

459
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,241
Corporal, ready the jet.

460
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,330
I'm initiating
North Wind Protocol "Zeta."

461
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,489
Twelve more penguins
taken from London Zoo.

462
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,768
Okay, boys, this is it.

463
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,969
The mission we've been preparing for
our entire lives.

464
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,811
We're gonna take down Dave,
or die trying!

465
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,840
- Kowalski, cancel our improv class!
- Yes, sir.

466
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,166
Rico, equipify!

467
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,970
Private, do that little thing I like.

468
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
It's still funny.

469
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,086
Skipper!
Good news!

470
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,163
I got them to credit our class!

471
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,810
Sir, the jet is ready.

472
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,566
Oh, yeah, baby!
Just like Super Bowl XIX!

473
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,125
They're stealing my stuff!

474
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,521
No! This mission has no place
for a pathetic waddle of useless penguins.

475
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,681
Who are you calling "pathetic"?

476
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Enough!

477
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,963
See, Rico?
That's why you can't have nice things.

478
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,521
You know,
I'm pretty good with computers myself.

479
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,326
Put on your jammies, penguin.

480
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,003
They are even cute when they're asleep.

481
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,002
Not to me!

482
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,688
I want these butterballs out of my way,
and out of my mission.

483
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,444
Ship them to one
of our safe-houses.

484
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,803
The most remote place on the planet.

485
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,009
Where the heck are we?

486
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,640
Oxygen content is low.

487
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,848
I suggest we limit our breathing.

488
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Private!

489
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,082
Sorry!
I get gassy when I fly.

490
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,321
Toot sweet!
He does!

491
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,891
We must be on a plane!

492
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,481
What did North Wind do to us?

493
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,889
They gave us badges!

494
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,808
Not badges, tranquilizer darts!

495
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,405
Classified!

496
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,803
That low-down dirty dog
is trying to kick us off the mission!

497
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,965
He thinks we can't save the penguins,
because we're just "penguins."

498
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,488
Well, penguins are our flesh and feathers!
They're us!

499
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,768
And if anyone's gonna save us...

500
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
it's us.

501
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,645
But, Skipper,
we've gotta be five miles up.

502
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,450
That pretty much limits our options.

503
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,648
I make my own options.

504
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,325
Brilliant move, Skipper.

505
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,562
But now we seem to
be outside the plane.

506
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,927
I kind of got caught up in the moment!

507
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,128
Well, hindsight's 20/20.

508
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,568
Okay, Kowalski,
your turn to pick up the slack.

509
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,846
Oh!
Why don't we catch that plane?

510
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,170
Bird strike, log it.

511
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,926
We've got another target, at 12 o'clock.

512
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,605
Good, it's only 11:30.

513
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,923
Follow me, boys, we're going in hot!

514
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,689
Hot, hot!

515
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,763
No one likes a showoff, Private.

516
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,365
Aim for first class!

517
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,001
I'm okay!

518
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,762
Kowalski, where does this aircraft go?

519
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,163
From the odd shape of this bagel,
I'd say we're headed for Paris.

520
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,005
France? Forget it!
Not with their tax laws!

521
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,049
Then I would suggest
a mid-air transfer.

522
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Affirmative!

523
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,044
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!

524
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
We're out of peanuts, Skipper!

525
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,726
Try pretzels, Private.

526
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,961
Bingo!

527
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,690
There's our ride, boys.

528
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,365
Can't stay, doll.

529
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,722
Danger is my mistress.

530
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,491
Rico, more height!

531
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,202
Pretzels, pretzels, pretzels!

532
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
We're out of pretzels!

533
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,649
Then we're leaving just in time,
because these folks are gonna freak!

534
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,644
Deploy flaps!

535
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,166
Stay on target!

536
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,968
We're gonna catch it!
We're gonna catch it!

537
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,808
Crikey!
We're not gonna catch it!

538
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,082
Wait a minute.
Where's Skipper?

539
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,322
Time to get creative.
Start grabbing boxes, boys!

540
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,565
Going long!

541
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,851
Private, stop playing
with those backpacks.

542
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,764
Find something useful!

543
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,206
Now we're talking!
Let's get to work.

544
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,930
400 meters.

545
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,081
300 meters.

546
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,447
Speak American, Kowalski!

547
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,409
Sorry, sir. 218 yards.

548
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,766
109 yards.

549
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,931
Okay, then.

550
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,884
It's clear what
we need to do next.

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,126
That feels right!

552
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,450
Impressive bouncing, boys.

553
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,967
Now, then, back to civilization.

554
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,929
If we're gonna take Dexter down...

555
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,050
we need to know
where he's gonna strike next.

556
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,044
Goal!

557
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,802
Elijah, would you please take them away?

558
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,049
Penguin footprints, still warm.

559
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,640
We just missed Dave.

560
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,205
Blast it!
He's gone!

561
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
So many penguins!

562
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,440
Boss!
He's stress-eating again!

563
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,209
Corporal!

564
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,202
There, there.

565
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,010
Rub the angry out of the tummy.

566
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Corporal!

567
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,965
Focus!

568
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,566
We are going to save
those helpless penguins...

569
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,361
because we are the North Wind...

570
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,806
and no one...

571
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,487
no one breaks the Wind.

572
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,881
No one breaks the Wind.

573
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,566
There's a good Corporal.

574
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,530
Now, we rescued those four penguins
already, didn't we?

575
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,490
Shipped them off, all cozy and snug,
to a Madagascar safe...

576
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,482
How come there's beeping?

577
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,881
Sir, those penguins...

578
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,769
they never made it to Madagascar.

579
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,251
What?
Well, where the dickens are they?

580
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,324
Kowalski, what are our coordinates?

581
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,684
From my calculations, we've arrived
in the center of Dublin, Ireland.

582
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,561
All right, soldiers, we gotta blend in.
Riverdance!

583
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,087
But no time
to kiss the Blarney Stone, boys.

584
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,481
We need to find intel
on Dave's location.

585
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,641
Pronto!

586
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,881
All right, you! Where's Dave?
Give us the goods!

587
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,725
Spit it out!
Don't make me use me shillelagh!

588
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,450
Sir, that's a baby squid.

589
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,525
Sorry, laddie.

590
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,282
Stranded on the Emerald Isle
without a single clue.

591
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,642
Well, so much for the luck o' the Irish.

592
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Skipper, look!

593
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,480
Begorrah!

594
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,926
Does anyone speak Gaelic?

595
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,561
No, but it looks like
Dave's been busy.

596
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,166
He's stolen penguins from Guadalajara!

597
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,005
- Madrid!
- Paris!

598
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,327
Athens!

599
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,527
Bangalore!

600
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Düsseldorf!

601
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,322
Osaka!

602
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,322
Rio de Janeiro!

603
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,130
- Nairobi!
- Amsterdam!

604
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,725
Baton Rouge!

605
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,248
Dave's snow-globe collection!

606
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,802
It's every zoo and aquarium
he got kicked out of!

607
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,724
Don't tell me
where he has been.

608
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,486
Tell me where
he will have has been next.

609
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,921
Wait, what is it, Rico?

610
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,404
It's a book!
It's a film! It's a play!

611
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,642
First word.

612
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,768
Two syllables. Sounds like...

613
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,767
Sounds like...

614
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,971
What starts with...?

615
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,170
Shanghai.

616
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,644
Dave hasn't been there yet, Skipper.

617
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,723
If we hurry, we can still stop him.

618
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,524
Nice work, Rico!

619
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,890
Pack your bagpipes, boys.
It's time to blow this potato stand!

620
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,366
So, this is it.

621
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,842
Shanghai's famous
Little Dublin district.

622
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Skipper, look!

623
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,329
I see you, Private.

624
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,847
Who's the big boy
standing on his tippy-toes?

625
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,128
- No, I mean...
- I just wanna eat you up!

626
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,044
Skipper, look!
Above Private!

627
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,921
Dave's next target.
Shanghai's famous Mermaid Penguins.

628
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,366
Good eye, Kowalski!

629
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
And once again...

630
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,286
you've proved that you are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

631
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,251
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

632
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,165
<i>Shanghai Marine World
is pleased to present...</i>

633
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,006
<i>our world famous Mermaid Penguins!</i>

634
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
<i>Tonight, our mermaids
dedicate their performance...</i>

635
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,966
<i>to all of the missing penguins
around the world.</i>

636
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,771
<i>Stay safe, little guys,
wherever you are.</i>

637
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,082
<i>And we hope you
come home real soon.</i>

638
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,364
Now, keep those eyes roving, boys.

639
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,966
Dave is a master of disguise.

640
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,487
He could be a small child,
a house plant.

641
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,449
Maybe even you, or me!

642
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,329
Is it you, Kowalski?

643
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,606
Hey, hold on.

644
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Wait a minute.

645
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Bingo!

646
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Nice try, Dave.

647
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,205
Operation "Flash, Splash, and Crash"
is a go.

648
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,088
Splendid!

649
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,810
Take positions.

650
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,203
<i>Penguin feeding time
will begin in two minutes.</i>

651
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,804
Target, 30 yards and closing.

652
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,127
In position, Skipper.

653
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,766
<i>Rico, report.</i>

654
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,411
In position.

655
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
And for you, Private.

656
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,522
Yes, Skipper!

657
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,682
- Here's your mermaid costume.
- What?

658
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,120
We need a diversion.

659
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,931
And, frankly, you're the only one
who can pull off that look.

660
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,129
But I can do more, Skipper.
I want to help the team.

661
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,850
Really help the team!

662
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,082
If you think I'm ready, which I am!

663
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,605
Assuming you agree, and perhaps even...

664
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,241
if you don't.

665
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,322
I like the moxie, soldier...

666
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,202
but right now, I need a tail on that tush
and the cutest smile you've got.

667
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,169
You trust me, soldier?

668
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,444
Aye-aye, Skipper.

669
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,364
Hey, it's feeding time!

670
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,082
Target, 10 yards from flashpoint.

671
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,605
Private, you're up.

672
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,522
You just mermaid my day!

673
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,166
"Flash" is a go!

674
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,362
Look! They let one of the mermaids
out of the tank!

675
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,601
Oh, she's so cute!

676
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,240
It's the cutest thing I've ever seen!

677
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,171
Shields up!

678
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,287
Target is stunned.
Rico, bring the "Splash."

679
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,366
Yeah, yeah!

680
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,888
What are you doing out here, cutie?

681
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,610
Come on, back in your tank.

682
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,524
Secure the mermaids, and find me...

683
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,730
David, the octopus.

684
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,289
A little late, North Wind.

685
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,770
Mission accomplished.

686
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,967
High one!

687
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,805
Corporal, take our prisoner...

688
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,725
the one that belongs to us,
into custody.

689
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,649
What?

690
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,371
You melted him?
You birds are sick!

691
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,047
He's going in through the pipes!

692
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Skipper!

693
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,684
Private?
Private!

694
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,889
You gotta get out of there!

695
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,449
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Private!

696
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Skipper!

697
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Private!

698
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,206
- Help!
- No!

699
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,245
Here we go!

700
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,290
Move, move, move!

701
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,001
He's got Private!

702
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,929
He's getting away!
He's getting away!

703
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,690
Skipper!
The North Wind's plane!

704
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,569
Sweet chariot of the gods!

705
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,926
But can you fly it, man?

706
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,646
There's only way to find out.

707
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,840
No...

708
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,281
I still can't read.

709
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,485
Then we're going off book.

710
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,205
No! No, no, no!

711
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,446
Too much, too much, too much!

712
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,604
I'm getting the hang of this, Skipper.

713
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,847
Good!
We're coming for you, Private!

714
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,680
Those ludicrous butterballs
are letting David escape!

715
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,001
Eva, secure transport.

716
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,162
Short Fuse, Corporal, hitch us a ride!

717
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,841
Fire!

718
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,844
Go, fetch!

719
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,011
Hold her steady!

720
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,921
Sir, Dave is pulling ahead.
We are too heavy.

721
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,840
Curse our heavily cheese-dibbled diet!

722
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,162
Rico, give me a West Helsinki fire sale!

723
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,891
- Yeah, yeah!
- Everything must go!

724
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,245
Huh? What the-J?

725
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,363
That's everything, sir.

726
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,846
Have you purged the chemical toilet?

727
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,604
But Rico was in there for 15 minutes!

728
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Just do it!

729
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,364
<i>Self-destruct sequence, in five...</i>

730
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Private!

731
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,085
- Stay strong, soldier!
- ...four...

732
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,890
<i>...three... two...</i>

733
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
...one.

734
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,161
Skipper's log.

735
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,446
Private has been kidnapped by Dave...

736
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,290
while we have been cast adrift
for what seems like days.

737
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,841
No rations, fresh water...

738
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,249
or land in sight.

739
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,444
Kowalski's sick as a dog...

740
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,291
and Rico...

741
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,761
keeps trying to eat him.

742
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,562
Just, please, just cut it out!

743
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,603
Not sure how long
we can hold on.

744
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,125
This may be my final entry.

745
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Ow!

746
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,961
2004, Grand Cru.
Hints of pear, white peaches.

747
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,485
This salmon is delicious.

748
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,486
I've never been
more hydrated in my life!

749
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,165
Let me cut you a piece of the salmon.

750
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,162
No, thank you.

751
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,731
It's the most delicious thing
on the boat.

752
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,325
I have to loosen my utility belt.

753
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,086
No, I'm full.
Just dump it in the ocean.

754
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,803
You know,
we're all in the same boat, here.

755
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,446
Actually, we're not.

756
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,171
And perhaps you could express
a little more concern...

757
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,084
over the fact that you stole
and destroyed...

758
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,925
a $19 million vehicle!

759
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,171
Bill me!

760
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Corporal?

761
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,602
Corporal!

762
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,081
We're picking up a signal, sir.

763
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,286
It's five klicks southwest...

764
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,006
but it stopped at that remote island.

765
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,161
Land?

766
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,527
Good on you!
You've tracked down some land.

767
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,205
No, silly willy.

768
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,489
We've been tracking
your little secretary/mascot.

769
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,642
What?
You put a homing device on Private?

770
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,370
All of you, actually...

771
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,045
when I "darted" you.

772
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,490
You low-down...

773
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,883
dirty, mangy, filthy...

774
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,726
flea-bitten, bum-sniffing
toilet-drinker!

775
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,601
But...

776
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,881
good!

777
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,487
See?
I told you.

778
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,331
You should've left this
to the professionals.

779
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,607
892... 893...

780
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,330
894...

781
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,770
Ahoy, there!

782
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,248
Penguins!

783
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,451
I bet you're all just dying to know
why I brought you here.

784
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,523
He's gonna kill us all!

785
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,081
What?
No.

786
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,250
My Medusa Serum doesn't kill anyone.

787
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,925
Where's the fun in that?

788
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,128
So, what does it do?

789
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,889
Something much, much worse.

790
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,922
Right!
But, like, what specifically?

791
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,446
Well, that's exactly
what I came up here to show you.

792
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,563
All I need is a test subject.

793
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,049
Hello, little buggy-boo!

794
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,000
Is this about the chirping?
Because I could...

795
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,810
Behold, as I unleash the full power
of the Medusa Serum!

796
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Fire!

797
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,849
Yes!
It works!

798
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,284
I made a monster!
I made a monster!

799
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,810
And all you adorable penguins are next!

800
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,689
Crikey!

801
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,566
Who said that?

802
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
No.

803
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,041
No.

804
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,161
Yes!

805
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,525
Gentlemen, you remember Private.

806
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,966
Hey, Private.

807
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,881
You'll never get away with this, Dave.

808
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,326
My brothers are coming.

809
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,326
And, together, we'll take a wrecking ball
to your whole rotten operation.

810
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,926
Call off the hunt, everyone.

811
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,041
Turns out the elite unit
will be coming to us.

812
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,041
<i>Eva.</i>

813
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,689
<i>What do you see?</i>

814
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,281
My count is 30 hostiles.

815
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,850
31.

816
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,325
Those two are very close... together.

817
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,165
I mean, "intertwined."

818
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,401
Physically.

819
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,530
But not in a...

820
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,569
lx-nay on the irt-flay, Kowalski.

821
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,721
Poor Private.

822
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,051
Alone!
Helpless in the belly of that beast.

823
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,567
We've faced some long odds
before, Skipper.

824
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,566
But these look like the longest.
And oddest.

825
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,560
If we're going to pull this off,
we'll need a diversion.

826
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,923
<i>Deactivating jungle camouflage.</i>

827
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,161
Will you be quiet?

828
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,367
Listen, Classified...

829
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,086
Short Fuse, you were supposed
to handcuff them to the raft!

830
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,441
Don't you hologram me!

831
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,365
I tried, but they don't have hands.
They just have flippers, boss.

832
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,684
And I have flippers,
so it's flipping useless!

833
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,004
All right, pooch.
If you won't work with us...

834
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,010
you better work for us.

835
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,009
Our plan requires a diversion.

836
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
I give the orders around here.

837
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,728
As much as it pains me,
I need you to act as our diversion...

838
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,609
for our operation.
Understood?

839
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,242
No! This is our plan, and it
requires you to cause a diversion.

840
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,367
- "Dye"-version.
- "Di"-version.

841
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,248
- "Dye."
- "Di."

842
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,210
- "Dye! Dye! Dye!"
- "Di! Di! Di!"

843
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,887
Gentlemen, there is only one way
to resolve this.

844
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,610
- We should kiss.
- Plan-off.

845
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,124
Yup, "plan-off."
That's what I was gonna say.

846
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,566
"Plan-off."

847
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,444
Here's Dave's sub.

848
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,923
And this young, helpless,
vulnerable rock...

849
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,684
is Private.

850
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,171
And here's Dave.

851
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,768
While you four blowhards
divert the octopi...

852
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,287
we strike fast, and strike hard!

853
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,806
Get on in here, boys!

854
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,365
Slap him silly, Rico! Come on!

855
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,849
Kowalski, free the hostages!

856
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,486
Now, that's what I'm talking about,
big fella!

857
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,407
With Private freshly liberated,
we celebrate with a well-earned high one...

858
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,927
and feast off Dave's sweet remains.

859
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,081
Any questions?

860
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,365
Whoa!
Hey, now!

861
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,211
Wow.
I mean, truly impressive.

862
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,291
Especially the bit
where you slap the fruit.

863
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,003
Corporal, dim the lights.
Short Fuse, glasses.

864
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,524
My apologies.
I had to rush a bit.

865
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,325
The schematic is a little crude.

866
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,005
Where is that music coming from?

867
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,201
All right.
At 21:50, Skipper, Kowalski and...

868
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,566
Richard, was it?

869
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,162
...divert the octopi
away from their posts.

870
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,966
At 22:00,
Short Fuse breaches the hull...

871
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,363
with a swarm of self-guided,
underwater nano-charges.

872
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,686
I call them "wet kabooms."

873
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,285
- Please, don't.
- Okay, sorry.

874
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,370
- At 22:02, knock-knock.
- Who's there?

875
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,727
- The North Wind.
- "The North Wind" who?

876
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,723
The North Wind who doesn't have time
for knock-knock jokes...

877
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,963
because we're too busy taking down Dave!

878
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,009
Personal hover tank?
Check.

879
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,441
Auto-targeting wing mounts?
Why not?

880
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,965
At 22:09...

881
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,522
...mission accomplished.

882
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,250
See that?
I don't even look back.

883
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,970
There's a huge explosion,
and I just keep walking.

884
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,085
Way to go, boss!
That's North Wind, sucker!

885
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,321
Nicely done.

886
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,850
Blah-di-blah-blah-blah.

887
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,561
A good plan is about more than
effect-y stuff...

888
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,767
and vocabulary words.

889
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,802
And you certainly
know a good plan.

890
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,760
Your operation in Shanghai
allowed Dave to escape...

891
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,365
with your boy.

892
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,089
I've never lost a member of my team.
It must feel...

893
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
awful!

894
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,647
God, imagine the guilt.
The regret.

895
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,167
The feeling that,
I don't know...

896
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,003
that it should have been you.

897
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,249
All for penguin plan.

898
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,881
All for North Wind plan.

899
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,321
His...

900
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,850
His is better.

901
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
What?

902
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,401
I'm sorry, boys.
But I can't lead you this time.

903
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,561
But...

904
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,724
we're a team.

905
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,888
And you're our skipper, Skipper.

906
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,247
We don't need these guys.

907
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,609
No, Kowalski, but Private does.

908
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,245
I think...

909
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,767
this time,
we leave it to the professionals.

910
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,604
- But, sir...
- it's settled.

911
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,286
We take our orders
from Agent Classified now.

912
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,404
That's an order, Rico!

913
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,407
All right, Classified...

914
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,406
what's the diversion?

915
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,880
We take this
shame to our graves.

916
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
Agreed.

917
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Hey!

918
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,563
- Time?
- 22:00 hours.

919
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,563
Time to take down Dave.

920
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,764
David, the octopus...

921
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,089
show me your tentacles.

922
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,441
All of them.

923
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,286
We lost them, Skipper.

924
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,207
<i>Not a moment too soon.
These hosen are ridin' up my bundesliga.</i>

925
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,842
All right, boys, grab your coconuts
and hold them tight.

926
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,891
Classified should be walking away
from a huge explosion...

927
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,806
with Private on his shoulder
in three, two...

928
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,530
Give him a welcome home, Rico!

929
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,483
Yes! In your face, Dave!

930
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,331
The Private is back!

931
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,242
Welcome home, Private!

932
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,731
Yeah, all right!

933
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,048
Here we go.
All right.

934
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,407
Sir, the sub didn't explode...

935
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,769
and I fear the fireworks...

936
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,003
may have been a tactical mistake.

937
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,686
Stay calm!

938
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,604
Do not panic!

939
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,171
We will still Win!

940
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,203
Be full of love!
Don't hate!

941
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,447
Follow your dreams.

942
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,602
Love yourself.
Love other people.

943
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,569
Pick and choose your battles in life!

944
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,609
Don't let anyone
tell you what to do.

945
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,000
Ignore the haters.

946
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,770
Love the one you're with.

947
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,200
Eva!

948
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,883
I know!

949
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,526
Welcome, Skipper, Kowalski,
and rootin'-tootin' Rico!

950
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,087
The gang's all here!
The mood is electric!

951
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,244
Is this really, finally everybody?

952
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,402
All right, Dave,
just what have you done with...

953
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Private!

954
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,881
Guys!

955
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,765
You're in for it now, Dave!

956
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,081
Really?

957
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,810
Anyway, great catching up.

958
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,760
Now, who's ready to move on
to live penguin testing?

959
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,764
You point that death ray
away from Private, right now!

960
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,490
It's not a death ray, Skipper.

961
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,802
He's gonna turn us into monsters!

962
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,206
Yepper-doo!

963
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,488
And what comes next, Dave?

964
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,801
Invasion!

965
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,927
Horrible mutant penguins,
unleashed on the streets of New York City!

966
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,809
You're the monster!

967
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,643
Yes!

968
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,006
I'm the monster.

969
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,371
Everyone made that clear to me
every day of my entire life.

970
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,926
But let's see how much everyone loves you
when you're the monster!

971
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,729
Skipper!

972
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,440
You can't take away Private's cuteness!

973
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,926
He's the cute one.
That's his thing!

974
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,808
What?

975
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,530
It's all the little guy's got!

976
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,131
You are super cute.

977
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,924
We better crank this up.

978
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,367
Drew, Barry, more power.

979
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,648
- Ready?
- Negotiations have broken down!

980
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,768
Rico, the paperclip!
Bust us out of here!

981
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,961
We need that paperclip!

982
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,201
Chop-chop, soldier!

983
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,285
Where's the paperclip?

984
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Private!

985
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,880
No!

986
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,690
- Private.
- Oh, no.

987
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,924
I disintegrated him.

988
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,242
That wasn't supposed to happen.

989
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,243
You maniac!

990
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,765
You blew him up!

991
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,481
No.

992
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh, well!

993
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,168
This is why we test things, people!

994
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,603
I'll have to lower the power
for the others.

995
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,490
Full speed ahead, gentlemen.

996
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,247
The monsters are due in Manhattan.

997
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,087
Sorry!

998
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,401
Crikey!

999
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,843
All right, all right, octopus.

1000
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,765
Whatever Dave's paying you,
I'll double it.

1001
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,328
Is that a yes?
Does anyone speak octopus?

1002
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,806
- Sorry.
- Not a clue.

1003
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
Blast it!

1004
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,087
You free us...

1005
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,964
we give you...

1006
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,884
many fishes!

1007
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,521
What is that?

1008
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,242
Oh, great.

1009
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,401
Oh, no! This is it!

1010
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,131
I don't want to die all squishy!

1011
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,681
We're dead.
Dead!

1012
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,764
Dead.
Dead!

1013
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,207
Oh, no, we're dead!

1014
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,721
Dead!

1015
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,164
Dead!

1016
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,887
I pushed a button!

1017
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,562
Super.
Well done, Private!

1018
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,131
<i>Good work, malinki.</i>

1019
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,527
Yes. Yes.

1020
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,082
Excellent button-pushing.

1021
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,440
Compliment, praise, etcetera.

1022
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,240
All right, agents...

1023
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,164
we are back in business.

1024
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,683
Wait!
Skipper, Kowalski, Rico...

1025
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,880
all those penguins...

1026
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,240
They're this way!

1027
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,890
So is a massive army of octopi.

1028
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,963
And as soon as we return
to the North Wind Headquarters...

1029
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,281
grab fresh equipment...

1030
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,885
and work up a smashing new plan...

1031
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,089
we'll come speeding back,
and take down Dave.

1032
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,323
But the penguins are in danger!
We have to go now!

1033
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,887
Again, "Huge army of octopi."

1034
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,725
So, because you failed once,
you're just running away?

1035
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,327
We did not fail.
And we are not running away.

1036
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,448
We're just very sensibly regrouping.

1037
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,726
Skipper wouldn't care!

1038
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,850
Plan or no, fancy equipment or no...

1039
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,442
he'd never leave a man behind!

1040
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,168
Well, I suppose we can't all be penguins,
can we?

1041
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
No.

1042
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,886
But maybe you should be.

1043
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,845
Come on.

1044
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,446
Showtime, everyone!
Big smiles for the Big Apple!

1045
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,250
Listen up, Doris!

1046
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,244
You turn us into freaks,
and then what?

1047
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,449
You think that's gonna
make everybody love you?

1048
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,367
No, but they'll despise you.

1049
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,801
And I'm sure
going to love that!

1050
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,608
Breaking news!
The missing penguins have been found!

1051
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,091
Okay.
According to my notes...

1052
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,050
genetic researcher, Dr. Octavius Brine
has found the penguins...

1053
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,280
and is bringing them here
to New York's Battery Park.

1054
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,129
The penguins are coming back!

1055
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,606
Oh, my gosh! Look!

1056
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,322
<i>Penguin lovers of the world!</i>

1057
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,166
<i>Guess who I found.</i>

1058
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,163
Penguins!
Penguins!

1059
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,810
<i>It wasn't easy...</i>

1060
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,930
<i>but seeing the penguins
get what they deserve...</i>

1061
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,287
<i>will make it all worthwhile.</i>

1062
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,046
What a weird thing to say.
I'm so excited!

1063
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,280
Do it.

1064
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,802
Skipper! Skipper! Skipper!

1065
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,166
Rico! Kowalski!

1066
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,122
It's like I can still hear
his little voice calling to us!

1067
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,090
You have to get out of there!
Move!

1068
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,449
"You have a great otter, there. Moo."

1069
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,801
Why would he moo?

1070
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,681
What are you asking me for?
I'm not Private's little ghost.

1071
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,440
Uh-oh.

1072
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,041
No!

1073
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,328
Are you ready?

1074
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Yeah!

1075
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,169
Yay!

1076
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,089
Your new...

1077
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,005
and improved...

1078
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,404
Penguins!

1079
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,604
Penguins!
Penguins!

1080
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,843
Penguins! Penguins! Penguins!

1081
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,490
The people love you.
Just go give them a hug!

1082
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,526
Don't let them touch you!

1083
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,767
Oh, no.
What's happening?

1084
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,610
Nobody likes you anymore?

1085
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,007
Well, the fun and games
are just beginning.

1086
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,525
Watch this, penguins!

1087
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,806
Somebody call...

1088
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,485
the exterminators!

1089
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,966
And when the exterminators
take you away...

1090
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,640
you never come back!

1091
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,327
Oh, dear.

1092
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,484
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1093
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,130
What do I do?
What do I do?

1094
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Crikey!

1095
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,843
Come on, then, you wanna go?
You want some argy-bargy?

1096
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,971
Uh-oh, missed one!

1097
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,728
What a wonderful day in the park!

1098
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,080
Skipper!

1099
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,726
Wait!

1100
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,488
Hold on!
What are you doing?

1101
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,720
Skipper!

1102
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,360
Don't eat that!

1103
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,242
Skipper, listen!
It's me, Private.

1104
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,641
I've got a plan, but I need your help.

1105
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,888
I need my Skipper.

1106
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,881
Private?

1107
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,530
Yes!
That's it!

1108
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,648
Private, you're alive!

1109
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,084
Oh, God!

1110
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,483
Kowalski!
You've got to get a grip!

1111
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,726
Kowalski!
Eva is worried about you!

1112
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,207
She is?

1113
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,361
What did she say?

1114
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,085
Did she say my name, specifically?

1115
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,847
I mean, were there tears?
Details! Come on, tell me!

1116
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,924
Private!
You're alive! Come here.

1117
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,809
This feels a little awkward...

1118
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,007
but I'm happy-

1119
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,123
Rico!
You need to listen to us.

1120
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,571
I guess you're kind of the same
either way.

1121
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,561
Heads up!

1122
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,005
Looks like we're back in business, boys.

1123
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,084
And our business is saving penguin-kind.

1124
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,846
Who's with me?

1125
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,081
Count me in.

1126
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,241
Let's do this!

1127
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,162
Let's create and feel momentum!

1128
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,600
Sir, how long do we stand here
like this?

1129
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,207
Until we've reached maximum coolness.

1130
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,171
There it is.

1131
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,771
Now all we need is a plan.

1132
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,081
I've got one!

1133
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,162
You stole Dave's ray?

1134
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,802
Well, I figured if we could
reverse the ray...

1135
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,122
we could turn everyone back to normal.

1136
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,601
Reverse the ray?

1137
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,881
That's brilliant!

1138
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,963
But it's impossible.

1139
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,964
In order to reverse the ray,
we would need to replace the Medusa Serum...

1140
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,488
with a power source
of almost immeasurable cuteness.

1141
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,483
"Immeasurable cuteness"?

1142
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,642
Where the heck
are we supposed to get that?

1143
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,330
No, wait, Private! No!

1144
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,164
We don't know what
that will do to you!

1145
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,042
All right!

1146
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,009
The ray!
It works!

1147
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:39,968
It works!

1148
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,690
Private!
Are you okay?

1149
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,160
Yes!

1150
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,290
Whoa!
Butt-hand!

1151
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,966
There's a hand attached to his butt.

1152
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,167
That was not there before.

1153
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,129
Get out of there!
That's an order!

1154
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,327
Permission to defy order.

1155
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,322
Permission denied!

1156
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,811
Then I deny your denial.

1157
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,041
It's too risky, Private!

1158
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,202
It already made you
sprout a butt-hand!

1159
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,647
I know it has to
be me this time.

1160
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,890
And I think you know it, too.

1161
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,727
I'm the secret weapon!

1162
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,485
I'm happy!
And yet...

1163
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:39,720
now that I have my revenge,
I feel empty.

1164
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,204
As if what I needed all along was...

1165
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,846
more revenge!

1166
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,849
In fact, Robin, write this down.

1167
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,241
Tomorrow, we move on to kittens!

1168
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,880
Then, puppies! Bunnies! Pandas!

1169
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,090
Charlize, they're on the ray!

1170
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,370
<i>Helen, hunt them down!</i>

1171
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,931
<i>William, hurt them.</i>

1172
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,411
<i>Halle, bury them!</i>

1173
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,847
<i>Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!</i>

1174
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,411
<i>Kevin, bake on!</i>

1175
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,245
<i>We're still gonna need
that victory cake!</i>

1176
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,367
We're only gonna get
one shot at this, boys.

1177
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,324
How we doing on those snow globes?

1178
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,728
Beam-splitter ready!

1179
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,166
Fire at Will!

1180
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,520
Do it, Skipper!

1181
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,246
Dead batteries?

1182
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,251
Game over, Skipper.

1183
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,280
No!

1184
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,050
Rico, batteries!

1185
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,806
Skipper, Kowalski,
hold off those octopi!

1186
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,883
We're doing this now!

1187
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,361
You heard Private!
Deploy!

1188
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,245
Get back, you aquatic savages!

1189
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,131
Behind you! Beside you!
Six o'clock! Twelve o'clock!

1190
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,080
They're coming from every direction!

1191
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,282
There's just too many of them!

1192
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,920
Whoa!

1193
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,007
You came back!

1194
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,328
Oh! That's why you look back
at the explosion.

1195
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,320
Fallback positions!

1196
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,160
Stay away from Private!

1197
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,081
Suck it up, Kowalski!

1198
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,601
No!

1199
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,728
It's over, Skipper.

1200
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,609
Over?
That's weird.

1201
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,082
Then why is Rico
throwing me a fresh pair of double-As?

1202
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,760
No!

1203
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,240
The remote!

1204
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,326
Rico!
Dibble me!

1205
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,440
It worked!

1206
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,841
Private!

1207
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,443
Excuse me!
Emergency! Coming through.

1208
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,528
Make a hole!
Make a hole!

1209
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,528
Oh, no!

1210
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,364
Don't worry!

1211
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,570
A chrysalis is just forming around you.
That's perfectly normal.

1212
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,930
Private.

1213
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Private?

1214
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,962
Oh, look at that.
Majestic!

1215
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,446
Hello!

1216
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,365
- Oh! Hey!
- What's wrong?

1217
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,526
Have I got something...?

1218
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,330
Cover your eyes.
Don't turn your head!

1219
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,326
So...

1220
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,126
How do I look?

1221
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,925
You're hideously disfigured...

1222
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,686
and will probably be hunted for sport.

1223
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,840
What?

1224
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,001
What?

1225
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,806
If there's anything we've learned
from this delightful adventure, Kowalski...

1226
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,201
it's that looks don't matter.

1227
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,241
It's what you do that counts.

1228
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,001
And look at what you did.

1229
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,329
Yes, sir.

1230
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,361
You are the most meaningful
and valued member of this team.

1231
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,565
Way to go, Private!

1232
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,730
Atta boy!

1233
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,451
Nicely done.

1234
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,000
Way to go, Private.
You did it!

1235
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,003
We're so proud of you!

1236
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,651
You saved us!

1237
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,882
We love you, Private!

1238
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,883
Yeah, we love you!

1239
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,724
You the penguin!

1240
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Ramirez!

1241
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,890
- "Dave."
- Dave!

1242
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,770
What?
Are you kidding me?

1243
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,324
Dave! Oh, look at you.

1244
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,087
You think this is over?
I'm just getting started!

1245
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,363
What do we do with him now?

1246
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,810
Open this right now!

1247
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,371
Here you go, kid.

1248
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,644
Cool!

1249
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,722
I hope you find happiness, Dave.

1250
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,208
It's snowing!
It's snowing! It's snowing!

1251
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,330
It's snowing! It's snowing!
It's snowing! It's snowing!

1252
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,566
Right. Now, then...

1253
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,524
This is difficult for me to say...

1254
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,409
Is it "osteoporosis"?

1255
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,960
You just gotta lean into the vowel.

1256
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,286
Os-tee-oh-...

1257
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,684
No, no.

1258
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,124
I want to say,
you four are the bravest agents I have ever known.

1259
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,760
The point is...

1260
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,490
I was wrong about you.

1261
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,526
And I hope there is some way
I can make it right.

1262
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,210
- Give us jetpacks?
- We should kiss.

1263
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,288
Did you just say...?

1264
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,925
Well, that feels right!

1265
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,248
I think I'd actually
prefer a jetpack, please.

1266
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,244
I think we should go with
Private's idea.

1267
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,002
Kowalski, what's our trajectory?

1268
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:24,041
95% certain this will end in massive,
flaming disaster.

1269
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,486
And the other 5%?

1270
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,803
Irrelevant, sir.
Jetpacks are awesome!

1271
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,007
Agreed.

1272
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,208
Who says penguins can't fly?

1273
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,880
Booyah!

1274
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,527
<i>Skipper, we are going to turn me
back to normal, right?</i>

1275
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,125
<i>Absolutely.
First thing, Monday.</i>

1276
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,169
I'm in a rocket ship!

1277
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,845
I want to push the button.

1278
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,001
Give me that.

1279
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,481
Stealer!

1280
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,164
Let's do this!
I'm ready!

1281
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,810
Okay, on three.
One, three, go!

1282
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,881
I'm just going to do
a little practice push.

1283
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,845
Okay, I'm not going to press it...

1284
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,685
Why are you smacking my hand?
Hey, look over there!

1285
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,890
I'm a laser show!

1286
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,401
Julien!

1287
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,721
Hey!

1288
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,526
That's the Private we know and love.
High one!

1289
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,163
Immeasurable cuteness, right there.

1290
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,606
Good to be back.

1291
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,765
I feel like a french fry.

1292
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,364
I'm okay!

1293
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,010
And with cuteness to spare.

1294
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,562
Come on!
Frosty mugs of herring juice, all around.

1295
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,760
- Private's buying.
- What?

1296
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,123
You know, if I'm being honest,
I expected a little more...

1297
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,360
pizzazz!

1298
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,362
Yes! Now, that's pizzazz!
