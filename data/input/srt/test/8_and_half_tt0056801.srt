1
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,332
Counselor! I've got him!

2
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:56,541
Down! You Come down!

3
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,916
Down for good!

4
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,749
forgive this early intrusion.

5
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,332
How are you?

6
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,457
l am a great admirer of yours.
Honored to meet you.

7
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,749
May l?

8
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,666
Can l use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,749
Your arm, please. Relax it.

10
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,582
- Your age?
- 43.

11
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,332
So, what are you Cooking up?

12
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,541
Another film without hope?

13
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,249
- First time taking the Cure?
- Yes.

14
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,124
Take a deep breath.

15
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,541
Come in.

16
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:52,082
- I'm sorry. l'll Come back later.
- No, do come in.

17
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,041
Breathe in.

18
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:56,749
Deeper.

19
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,916
Good morning... May I smoke?

20
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,416
Cough.

21
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,791
Breathe in.

22
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,999
- You've already read it?
- Yes.

23
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,124
Breathe.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,707
And... what do you think?

25
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,957
Well, I made some notes,
but we'll talk later.

26
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:32,166
Your system is a bit worn out.
You may get dressed now.

27
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,041
Nice looking girl. American, right?

28
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,832
You've got some fine merchandise there.

29
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,916
This treatment will do you good,
you'll see.

30
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,832
Nurse. 300 ml of holy water,

31
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,749
3 doses to be taken at 15 minute intervals,
on an empty stomach.

32
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,332
- Mud bath every other day...
- What time is it?

33
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:59,332
After the mud bath, ten minutes in the
mineral water as presCribed...

34
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,999
- I'll wait for you at the spring.
- Yes, thank you.

35
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,166
Sir!

36
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,416
Sir, your glass.

37
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,916
Over here.

38
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,791
You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

39
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:39,499
fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

40
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,082
frankly, I wouldn't want to be
the one to cause you any trouble.

41
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,582
No, don't worry.
l'm the one who called you in.

42
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,957
On first reading it's evident

43
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,791
that the film lacks a problematic,
or a philosophical premise...

44
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,374
Would you like to sit down?

45
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,124
...making the film
a series of gratuitous episodes,

46
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,999
perhaps amusing
for their ambiguous realism.

47
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,166
One wonders what the authors
are trying to say...

48
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,541
Are they trying to make us think?
To scare us?

49
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:15,457
from the start, the action reveals
a poverty of poetiC inspiration.

50
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,041
forgive me, but this might be
the definitive proof

51
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:26,082
that cinema is 50 years
behind all other arts.

52
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,124
The subject doesn't even have the merits

53
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,374
of an 'avant garde' film,
but it has all the shortcomings.

54
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,416
Here, my notes.
l doubt they will be helpful.

55
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,916
lt's still a mystery that you'd think of me

56
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,041
for a collaboration that, frankly,
l don't think can work.

57
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,791
No, no. On the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

58
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:57,582
You see, the film...
l really want to make this film.

59
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,791
l postponed the shoot
for two weeks beCause...

60
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,124
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.

61
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,416
Mezzabotta! Mario!
You're here too?

62
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,249
Guido!

63
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,249
What happened to you!

64
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,582
Hey, big Guido, how are you?

65
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:30,416
You've sprouted quite a few
white hairs, old Snaporaz!

66
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,749
Are you drinking that stuff?
lt's bad for you.

67
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,124
They said my liver is, well...
And you, what's your treatment?

68
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,791
Just a second... Gloria!

69
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,874
- Your daughter. She's all grown up.
- No, she's not my daughter.

70
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:52,249
Cruel bees, sucking all the life
from these poor flowers.

71
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,916
- Darling, this is my friend...
- I'm sorry. My shoes...

72
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,832
Gloria. Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,499
fine, thank you.

74
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,332
l know all about you.
Pupi always, always tells me.

75
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,957
We even had a big fight
when I was very Critical of your last film.

76
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,499
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

77
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,582
Let's go for a drink. Let's go.

78
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,124
And you, are you here alone?
And your wife?

79
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,916
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Better that way...

80
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,291
Well, I mean, better in general...

81
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,707
You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

82
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,249
We're waiting for an annulment.

83
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:35,166
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

84
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:36,999
Congratulations.

85
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,624
Well, big Guido. What are you
working on? Something good?

86
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,791
Sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.

87
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,624
Daumier, the author, Miss...
Pardon me, what is your name?

88
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,374
- Gloria.
- Gloria Morin.

89
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,749
Nice to meet you.
l am a big admirer of yours.

90
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,207
l'm flattered.

91
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,541
Are you an actress?
Did I see your photo somewhere?

92
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,082
An actress. Yes, well...

93
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,957
l have ambitions in that area.
Actually enormous ambitions,

94
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,249
but that's all, for the moment.

95
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,624
She's got a degree in philosophy.

96
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,791
Allow me. Mario Mezzabotta.
- Nice to meet you.

97
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,832
l don't have a degree.
l'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.

98
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,457
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

99
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,624
The loneliness of modern man
in contemporary theater.

100
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,457
lnteresting subject. Right, Professor?

101
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,707
And what is the meaning
of the CapriCious apparitions

102
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,499
of the girl of the spring?

103
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,749
An offer of purity?
Of warmth to the protagonist?

104
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,291
Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst...

105
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,999
She didn't make it. Better that way.

106
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,749
- Yack! How are you?
- Not too bad.

107
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,791
- Did anybody reCognize you?
- I don't think so.

108
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,457
You brought all that luggage?

109
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,957
lt's just five suitcases.
Gowns occupy so much spaCe.

110
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,666
l brought one... you'll see.
Did you get it all?

111
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:04,791
Carla, it's quiet here at night.
There's nothing going on.

112
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,332
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows,

113
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,957
some trendy clubs,
even at our hotel.

114
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,457
Have you been behaving?
- Yes, yes.

115
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,374
Actually... l Couldn't get you a room
in my hotel,

116
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,582
and besides it's full of people who know me.

117
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,791
So, I found someplace else.
A perfect hotel...

118
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,249
Very pretty, you know...
- But why?

119
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:30,207
- And how's this guy?
- Sgulp? Great.

120
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,291
You look a little pale. How come?

121
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,416
See, the hotel is right here.

122
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,999
Signora, guests!

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,332
See. Like l told you. It's not...

124
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,707
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,

125
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,916
l'll get them to bring a couple
of sandwiches.

126
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:51,832
lt feels a little sad here.
- No, it's typiCal!

127
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,332
Besides I'm hungry.
You had lunCh, but I didn't.

128
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,832
Hello, Sir.

129
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,124
How's the solitaire Coming along?

130
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,999
Everything's ready,
the room, the bathroom.

131
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,541
Rest assured.
Signora will feel at home.

132
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,166
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't
have anything ready for lunch?

133
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,791
- The restroom, please?
- It's over there.

134
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,916
l'll see to it personally.

135
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:14,666
Trains, such horrible things.
They leave your hands so black.

136
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,874
Are you happy I'm here?
- Yes.

137
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,207
- Really happy or a little happy?
- Very happy.

138
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,749
Hmm. SmaCk!

139
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,332
Mm, what a nice smell!

140
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,832
Guido, I thought this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

141
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,999
- Really? Good, good.
- But no. Not a wrinkle.

142
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,041
Even after a three-hour trip.

143
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,957
You didn't even tell me you like it.
Do you like it?

144
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,666
Such a beautiful lady!

145
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,749
So refined.
That thing she has on her head...

146
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,832
What is it? Ploosh?

147
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,457
- Plush, plush.
- Ah, ploosh.

148
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,916
l looked around for it like crazy.
l was quite desperate.

149
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,957
But you know me.
When Carla makes up her mind...

150
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,707
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

151
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,874
l read a good Donald Duck last week...

152
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,582
There was a dinosaur...

153
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,999
- Here she is, my sweet-buns.
- Be good, a dinosaur...

154
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,166
Guido be good.
What do you want to do now?

155
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,249
Are you sure you've been behaving?
- Sure, why?

156
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,166
Anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry.
Oh, my wedding ring.

157
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,707
Listen, Guido.
That little thing you promised me...

158
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,957
What little thing?

159
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:33,332
Now l bet she brings up
her husband again.

160
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:37,291
You don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

161
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,916
My poor Luigi doesn't seem
happy at all.

162
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,457
You see, my husband is not
the confident type.

163
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,707
He gets depressed.

164
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,791
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very Clever...

165
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,749
lt's so hot here!

166
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,624
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

167
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,957
He just needs a push.

168
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,582
He's still working at the
fuel company, same salary.

169
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,541
Really?

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,332
Be good and put down my purse.
You'll break it.

171
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,624
l love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

172
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,749
Why don't you find him a job?

173
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,041
You know so many people.
You've promised it so many times.

174
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,749
l even had a dream about it.

175
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,832
l dreamed that
you did find him a job,

176
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,791
but he'd lost his mind
and killed us both.

177
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,832
- Who?
- You and me!

178
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,791
Know where we were?

179
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,082
ln that little street, Via della Croce,
where I bought you

180
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,082
the same tie your wife did.
Do you remember?

181
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:44,374
And l never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

182
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:49,041
We were there on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked.

183
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,499
And he came in and he killed us
both with a broom!

184
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,332
- Draw the blinds more.
- Yes.

185
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,791
That's it. Now go into
the corridor for a minute,

186
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,624
then pretend you've come
to the wrong room

187
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,082
and found a stranger.

188
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,624
Oh, that's good.
We've never done this one.

189
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,999
Hold it there.
Let me look at you.

190
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:18,666
No. No. Your make-up
needs to be more, more...

191
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,457
- More what?
- More like a slut!

192
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,499
Give me your eyeliner.

193
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,999
- Nice lampshade.
- Yes, yes.

194
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,499
- I'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

195
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,041
What is this hotel called?

196
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,249
The Railway Hotel.

197
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,791
l want to write to my
husband so he'll send me

198
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,457
an express letter right away.
He writes such niCe letters.

199
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,832
l'll let you read them.
- Fine, but keep still...

200
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,207
Make a slutty face.

201
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,999
Go out in the corridor.

202
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,457
- So, it's a part I have to play.
- Yes.

203
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,166
Who do you think I am?
One of your actresses?

204
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,791
You don't think
l Could be one of them?

205
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,749
Not me. I wouldn't want
to lead that life.

206
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,666
l like staying home.

207
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,832
Go on, get out. l'm sleeping now.

208
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,041
Tell me. If l were really
to do something like this,

209
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,499
would you be jealous?

210
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,374
Why? Would you really?

211
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,457
Who knows?

212
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,874
- May I get you something?
- No, I just Came out on a whim.

213
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,541
- Would you like me to run you a bath?
- No, I was just...

214
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:36,707
- A glass of water, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

215
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,916
What did she want?
What did she say?

216
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:44,874
The owner, she wanted
to give me a glass of water.

217
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,082
Come here. Come.

218
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,832
Open up the sheet.

219
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,874
- Guido, do you love me a little?
- Yes, yes.

220
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,957
ls that you, Mama?

221
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,541
So many tears, my son,
so many tears.

222
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,332
Papa, wait! Don't go.

223
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,666
We talked so little.

224
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,291
Listen Papa,
l have so many questions.

225
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,916
l Cannot answer them yet.

226
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,624
See the ceiling here? lt's so low.

227
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,041
l would have liked it higher.
lt's ugly, my son, ugly.

228
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:04,332
l would have liked it different.
Couldn't you take care of it?

229
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,582
You used to draw so well. l'd like...

230
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,582
Oh, the Commendatore,
he shouldn't have bothered.

231
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,916
- Hello.
- Respects. He's got very little time.

232
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,749
Hi.

233
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,916
How is he doing, this son of mine?

234
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,666
Careful. Don't let him move you.

235
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,624
He isn't doing well? How come?

236
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:38,249
lt is so hard, realizing that
one has made suCh huge mistakes.

237
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,207
But I...

238
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,791
Mother prepared you
a little something.

239
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,582
A little Cheese and two peaches.

240
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,999
Don't worry about me.

241
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,666
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

242
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,916
but your mother Comes every day.

243
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,707
She keeps me company, you know.
And keeps everything in order.

244
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,832
A little decorum is always necessary.

245
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,916
That's how we were brought up.

246
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,041
And with your wife, Luisa -- all fine?

247
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,374
Yes. Luisa...

248
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,082
You two together have been
my joy. Goodbye, son...

249
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,666
What is this place?
Do you like it here?

250
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,207
l haven't figured it out yet.

251
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:31,207
But it's going much better.

252
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:36,707
At first, you see, at first...

253
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:43,707
Guido! I do my best.
What more Can l do?

254
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,041
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

255
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,957
l'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

256
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,916
What are you thinking about?

257
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,707
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,291
Good afternoon.

259
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,416
Guido! In a few days,
l'll get you an introduction

260
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,207
so you can get
all the advice you need.

261
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,082
Nice mystical figure. Right?

262
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,124
l brought you the three old men.

263
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,207
One is a Russian,
another is a retired general...

264
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,374
What old men?

265
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,041
The ones for the role of the father.

266
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,124
Cover me, Cesarino...

267
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,374
Come here, buffoon.

268
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:49,541
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

269
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:52,332
- I called you six times.
- Yes, yes l know.

270
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,832
- It's about Claudia's script.
- So?

271
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,291
l thought about mailing it to you.

272
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,332
ln fact, I've already mailed it.
- Really?

273
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,457
You've still got your looks.
Why don't you go back to acting?

274
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,916
l was up all night with
an idea for the spaceship.

275
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,582
Why don't we make the upper story...

276
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,749
ConocChia, don't take my arm!
l hate it! And wear a jaCket!

277
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,582
Now l need to wear a jacket
to talk to you...

278
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,624
How are you? How was your trip?

279
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,582
Good. It's been an hour...

280
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:22,166
What a blinding vision! Beautiful!

281
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,791
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,249
You're always telling me
l'm 'bellissima'

283
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,874
but you never tell me about my part.

284
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,666
How was my screen test?
- Great, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:41,707
They told me I have to look
motherly and eat a lot of pasta.

286
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,374
l should gain six pounds. Is this all?

287
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,957
See? You already know
more than I do.

288
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,166
You are the author.
You should be telling me something.

289
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,624
- What should this lady do?
- What?

290
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,541
Agostini!

291
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:02,499
l don't want to bother you.
The hotel is grand,

292
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,874
the whisky, excellent.
But I have three questions.

293
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:09,624
Yes, yes, later. What is it?
Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.

294
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,499
Agostini, we should...

295
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,749
l just didn't feel like talking to that guy.

296
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,624
Claudia is getting offers
from all over the world.

297
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,624
l Can't keep her waiting.
Give her something.

298
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,707
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

299
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,666
Does Claudia realize that this
might be a great part?

300
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:30,291
Perhaps the best she's ever
played? I'll explain...

301
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,332
l'm telling you as a friend,
you're gonna lose her.

302
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,541
- You want to see the old men or not?
- Are you crazy? We're ready...

303
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,082
What?
- The old men.

304
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,832
- Where are they?
- Here.

305
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,166
Signora Carla called. She doesn't
want to stay in that hotel.

306
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:53,499
lt's ugly. She's right.
- What can I do? Bring her here?

307
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,291
l'll Call the old men.

308
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,499
Sorry, I wanted to introduce you
to my little wife.

309
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,332
Thrilled.

310
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,999
She writes too. She's a Columnist
for some ladies' magazines.

311
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,832
She's got a few questions for you.

312
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:12,249
My readers go crazy for romance.

313
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:16,749
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

314
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,541
Here they are.
Say hello to the Dottore.

315
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:23,582
Step down. You too, General.

316
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,416
- How old are you?
- 70.

317
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,082
- And you?
- 64.

318
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,457
- And you?
- 68.

319
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,166
They aren't old enough.

320
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,999
What? This one
has one foot in the grave.

321
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,332
Next time l'll get three corpses.
You asked for a pathetiC type...

322
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:46,124
This one makes you wanna Cry
the minute you see him.

323
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,082
Hello, Commendatore.

324
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,374
lf you kneel, what do l do?

325
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,457
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.
How are you, little Guido?

326
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,374
Hello, Commendatore.

327
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,541
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

328
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,499
Where's the swimming pool?

329
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,749
We haven't even checked in. Shut up!

330
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,041
Has the treatment helped?
- Yes.

331
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,332
- Feeling better? Here.
- What is it?

332
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,332
Just a token.

333
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,416
- You're always giving me presents.
- It's just like mine.

334
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,749
lt doesn't need winding.

335
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,124
A watCh! A little watch, everyone!

336
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,332
- So, are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, I really think so.

337
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,249
We've got the Americans...

338
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,499
l've seen her passport.
She's 52 years old?

339
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,416
Ah, she's a little girl.

340
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,457
Good evening, signora.

341
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,582
And who are you, darling?

342
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:16,749
Mr. Director, another little question...

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,332
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

344
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,707
Thank you, I got it.

345
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:30,666
You want to know about
my political affiliation.

346
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:34,916
As an honest man,
and all of you Italians are,

347
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,999
you should be able to answer me.

348
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,249
ls Italy an essentially CatholiC country?

349
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,999
Yes, it is!

350
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,457
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

351
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,249
lt's the estimate for the spaceship.

352
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:53,332
l need to talk to you later,
face to face,

353
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,707
l'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

354
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:02,416
fine, we'll disCuss it later.
What was that about your cholesterol?

355
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,832
...only one great writer.
The early fitzgerald.

356
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:30,457
Then his writing became an orgy
of pragmatism or brutal realism.

357
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,791
What does Left or Right mean?

358
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,582
You're such an optimist
to believe that in a world

359
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,582
this confused and chaotic
there are people so lucid

360
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:42,791
as to belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right.

361
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:46,916
The Americans have this new
theory about cholesterol...

362
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,999
- Is your ice-cream good?
- Very good.

363
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,249
Could you say approximately
how many sCenes she'll be in?

364
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,207
What?

365
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,332
- How many scenes?
- Five.

366
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:03,999
Only five.

367
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,749
Maybe six, or even seven.

368
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,457
Good evening.

369
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,416
Hi, Guido.

370
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,457
The Ambassador's got his eye on signora.

371
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,541
So?

372
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,749
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Good, now I know.

373
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,957
- Do you want me to ask her to dance?
- Yes, ask her.

374
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,624
Dear friends there's only one truth...

375
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:33,541
But I am so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

376
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:37,249
l need to coexist with my character
for a while before shooting...

377
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,457
The lady says she needs
to know her character.

378
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:47,374
l need to get inside her skin,
her ideas, or I'll fail.

379
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,249
Hasn't the Maestro explained
the part yet?

380
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,082
- No.
- I am sorry, dear lady.

381
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,791
l don't have such information.
l'm only the producer.

382
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:01,499
Guido, isn't it true that l know nothing?
- Right. Not a thing.

383
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,041
And now three days of rest.

384
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:18,957
They look like glass.
The first cherries of spring.

385
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,916
Thanks. And for Guido?

386
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,291
Mario Mezzabotta,
all 200 pounds of him.

387
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,791
Shall we take a little walk?

388
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:48,207
l know... Naturally,
you think I've lost it.

389
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,166
Yes.

390
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:52,291
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- It's all right.

391
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:57,457
l may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

392
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:04,207
Could you create something important,
beautiful and real on a Commission?

393
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,707
for instance, if the Pope asked you?

394
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,832
Yes, yes. l'll think about it.
Excuse me.

395
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,916
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

396
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,249
Maybe she's only with me
for the money.

397
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,957
Actually, that's certainly it.

398
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,416
But I've never felt closer
to anybody in my life.

399
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,791
Just look at her.
She's pretty, Charming, intelligent.

400
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,624
She has it all. Only for the money?

401
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,999
But there are so many rich young men
around these days, loads of them.

402
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,791
lt's clear. She cares for you.

403
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:39,874
Right. And she hasn't tried
to pressure me.

404
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:42,416
l made up my mind rationally.

405
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,124
The poor thing has never
even mentioned my wife,

406
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,374
my family, never a reproach.

407
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,124
How did you meet her?

408
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:55,124
ln London. She was in school
with my daughter.

409
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,749
How many years have you
been married?

410
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,541
Many. 31 .

411
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,249
And your wife...

412
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,082
My wife took it really badly.
She hates her.

413
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,874
While Gloria, poor thing,
is fond of her.

414
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,457
So spell it out. I am a fool!

415
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,416
There must be a shooting sChedule.
Dates.

416
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:20,124
Otherwise we're off to Germany.
We have other offers.

417
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,499
Will you be leaving me
in the dark 'til the end?

418
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,166
You look like a little snail.

419
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:32,916
- What is a little snail?
- Une petite escargot.

420
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,916
Can you hear the voice
of the springs?

421
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,541
The Romans used to call it
'Happy Waters.'

422
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:03,249
Maya, let's entertain these bores.

423
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,957
May l?

424
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,291
Are you ready, Maya?
What am l holding?

425
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,416
A velvet purse.

426
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,332
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

427
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,082
A red one.

428
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,166
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

429
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,957
- A purse.
- Is there any money in it?

430
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,874
2,725 lire.

431
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,791
And this lady here.
What is she thinking?

432
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,624
No dirty thoughts, I hope.

433
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,124
Just think about something.

434
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,457
About what?

435
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,957
Whatever you like.
Are you thinking?

436
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,249
Yes.

437
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,582
l'd like to live another 100 years.

438
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,249
Best of luck!

439
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,374
And what is in this pretty
lady's head?

440
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,666
Let me be.

441
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,082
May l think about someone?

442
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,707
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!

443
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,624
forget about it. l'm ashamed.

444
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,291
What about?

445
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,166
Can l really think of a person?

446
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,874
l'd be afraid to have my thoughts read.

447
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,916
Don't you worry darling,
no risk there.

448
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,791
Would you like to leave? It's cold.

449
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,957
A little kiss and a big slap.
ls that right?

450
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, 'What a triCkster.'

451
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,749
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick.

452
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,999
And it isn't just a coincidence.

453
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,332
lt's an exceptional example
of magnetic fields and telepathy.

454
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,707
l transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.

455
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,499
You! Do you believe
you can hide your thoughts?

456
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,457
Please, leave her alone.
Don't insist.

457
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,582
Thoughts are sacred.

458
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,291
See, it's all a game.

459
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,874
Maya, are you ready?

460
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:05,166
Just a moment, Could we know
what you gentlemen are thinking?

461
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,582
You for instance.

462
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,041
What are you thinking?

463
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:11,416
What else? My director.
My cross and my delight.

464
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,832
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

465
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,291
lt has been quite a while... years!

466
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,249
Unfortunately yes, my dear.

467
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,749
Just a moment. You're famous now.

468
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,916
Cut it out.
Just tell me what's your trick?

469
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,541
Well, it's partly a trick,
but part of it is real.

470
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,457
l don't know how, but it happens.
- Can you transmit anything?

471
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,041
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

472
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,124
- Do you want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

473
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,582
l bet now, with you, it won't work.

474
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:50,124
l don't understand. I can't repeat...

475
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:20,249
Asa... nisi... masa?
ls this right?

476
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,499
- Right?
- Yes.

477
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,916
But what does it mean?

478
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,749
Guido, come here!
Where are you?

479
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,291
Don't be spoiled! What a wonder!

480
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,666
l don't want to take a bath,
l don't want to...

481
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,332
Come here... Iet me catch you?

482
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,707
l know what that rascal wants.

483
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:43,374
He wants to be carried
by his sweetheart,

484
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,041
doesn't he, the strapping lad.

485
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:48,082
Come here. Come here.

486
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,499
He never wants to take
the wine bath, the naughty boy.

487
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,041
Don't you know that if you do
you'll grow into a strong man?

488
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:56,249
Guido is scared! Guido is scared!

489
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,166
The Devil and damnation!

490
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,999
Granny, granny!

491
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,832
The wood is all wet this year.

492
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,541
This prowling cat is just
like your grandfather.

493
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,999
Always on the prowl
and only comes in for food.

494
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,457
Shame on you! Go to bed.

495
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,999
Last time l slammed the door
in his face

496
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,416
and left him outside for two days.

497
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,207
l Could have married again
and found a handsome man,

498
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,832
rest assured, better
than your grandfather.

499
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,832
What an idiot I am!

500
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:52,749
l thought that if l took another
husband, my first husband,

501
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,624
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't have waited.

502
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,624
Be quiet! Go to bed, children!

503
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,207
Nanny, Claudio wet himself!

504
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,582
What are you doing?
Go to sleep. You too, sleep.

505
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,791
Little Guido, get under the covers.
lt's cold. Be still.

506
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,457
Did you say your prayers?

507
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,999
Aren't you a beautiful stiCky bun?
The most beautiful!

508
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,874
Give me a kiss, too.

509
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,874
Who do you love best? Me?
ls that right?

510
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,791
You can't fool me.

511
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,124
l'm going to give you a spanking.

512
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:13,332
l Can tell when you're pretending.

513
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,291
Sleep tight, little creatures.

514
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,541
Close your eyes.

515
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,999
Guido, don't close your
eyes tonight!

516
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,541
lt's the night the portrait's eyes move.
You're not scared, are you?

517
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,041
You must be quiet!

518
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,791
Uncle Agostino will look into
the corner and find the treasure!

519
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,791
Don't be afraid, Guido!
We'll be rich!

520
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:54,832
Do you remember the spell?
Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!

521
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:32,916
Sir, you got two or three calls from Rome.
Your wife, l think.

522
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:36,166
fine. Get me the line.

523
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,957
- Gino, get the gentleman the line.
- All right.

524
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:42,874
- This is for you. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

525
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,374
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

526
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,457
No, l'm not offended.

527
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:04,041
There's only one thing
that offends me.

528
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:11,124
You know me. No.

529
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:16,124
l forgive him everything.

530
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,541
Let's have a little chat.

531
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,624
Sit beside me for a moment.

532
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:32,874
No, l'm going to bed.
l'm very tired and waiting for a call.

533
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:34,582
Would you like some?

534
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:37,249
No, thank you.
l have such a headache.

535
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,916
Give me your hands.

536
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,332
No, sit down.

537
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,124
l have a healing fluid
in my left hand.

538
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,999
l put it on my belly when it aChes.

539
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,582
Take off your hat.

540
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:56,832
ls it any better?

541
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:02,791
Yes, maybe.

542
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,082
Why do you look at me that way?

543
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,499
Oh, don't say I'm beautiful.
You make it sound insulting.

544
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,332
What's with you?

545
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,291
l don't know.

546
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:28,041
l feel l made all the wrong
decisions in my life and in my work.

547
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,416
Tell me, why do you enjoy
torturing me?

548
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,041
Torturing you?

549
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,082
Talk to me as you would
to an old friend.

550
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:44,082
l need to feel close to my director.

551
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,749
Did you see my last movie,
the one shot in Belgrade?

552
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,082
My character was a woman
marked by the injuries of time,

553
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,999
yet still desirable...

554
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,707
- Play "Mystification".
- I don't know it.

555
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,541
But yes...

556
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:07,832
What a character... this woman...

557
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,457
But...

558
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:13,291
ln whom people find protection
and love.

559
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,249
l am this character.
l am like her in life and love.

560
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,166
That's why l'm so lonely.

561
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,957
And l have always forgiven
everything in the man...

562
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:27,541
the men, I love.

563
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:30,291
- Sir, Rome on the line.
- Thank you.

564
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,749
l am very sensual. WiCked, too!

565
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,166
Yes, yes, you're very close.
l'll be right baCk.

566
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:42,707
Rome on the line. You may speak.

567
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,707
Hello, yes!

568
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:46,374
- Do you want Luisa?
- Yes.

569
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:49,541
feeling guilty, you beast?
This is Rossella.

570
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:52,457
Hi, Rossella. How are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

571
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:56,541
Where were you this time?
Your rest cure? What an exCuse...

572
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:58,332
Here Comes Luisa.

573
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,957
Guido, I called you twiCe.
Where were you?

574
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,749
l know. I'm sorry.

575
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,832
l was up in the production office.
We're working.

576
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,874
How are you?

577
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,624
Not bad... And the treatment?

578
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,791
ls it helping?

579
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:16,541
Perhaps. But, you know,
l Can't really rest.

580
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,499
And you? What are you doing?
Having fun?

581
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,207
The usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, EnriCo.
They were about to leave.

582
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:24,707
But are you having a good time?
Did you meet anybody?

583
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,499
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.

584
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,332
But for my work, it's better this way.

585
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,582
- Good night, Guido.
- 'Night.

586
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:34,499
You've met no one you know?
Are you always alone?

587
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,791
Of course.

588
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,457
Really?

589
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:41,291
Luisa, why don't you come visit?

590
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,499
Just a short stay.
lt's easy to get here.

591
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,791
When are you going
to start shooting, you bore?

592
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:48,166
l don't know.
Let me talk to Luisa, please.

593
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,624
So, should I come?
Do you want me to?

594
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,166
lf you'd like to.

595
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,332
You could even bring a friend.

596
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,791
But would it make you happy?

597
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,082
Of course, or I wouldn't ask you.

598
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,416
- Sir, are you staying on?
- No.

599
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,291
When should I come?

600
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:03,582
Whenever it's good for you.

601
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,082
Careful, I'll come.

602
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,041
Darling, I wouldn't have asked.

603
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,707
l'd love it...
So long, and good night.

604
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,874
Bye, Mr. Alienated. Good night.

605
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:13,999
Night, Guido.

606
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,541
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought...

607
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:27,457
Just a second, madam. I am going
to step into the office so...

608
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,916
- Shit!
- It's in my best interest.

609
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:33,666
Tomorrow morning
we'll disCuss everything. All right?

610
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,791
Beams for the central structure:
1 0,000.

611
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:45,041
Planks for steps: 260.

612
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,499
'Evening.

613
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:47,624
Do you need something?

614
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,916
No, thanks.
Go on with your work.

615
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,874
What a well-behaved
produCtion team.

616
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:55,916
Hi.

617
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,124
Oh, hi Eleonora.

618
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:02,499
2,350. Corrugated iron.

619
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,207
Listen, Dottore, since you're here.

620
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:07,499
l Called the pensione about
the German, but she's gone.

621
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,499
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

622
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,582
Really?

623
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,582
What should I do?

624
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,124
What an honor, Dottore.

625
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,541
You've Caught me
with my pants down!

626
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:27,291
Listen Guido.
About the farm... there's that...

627
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,457
Ah, here. Where's this place?

628
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:34,582
lt doesn't even have a note
about the address, nothing!

629
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:36,457
lt's in the PrinCe's estate.

630
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,957
- Who's in here?
- My little nieces.

631
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:40,666
Eva and Dina.

632
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:42,332
'Evening.

633
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,499
C'mon. Let him take a look at you.

634
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:48,249
Perhaps he'll give you
a little part.

635
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,582
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

636
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:53,916
Where are you from?

637
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,082
- Trieste.
- Hurray for Italy!

638
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,041
You've got a nice set up here,
don't you?

639
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,124
Tell him about my cousin.

640
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,457
Guido. This one's cousin
is six feet tall.

641
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,707
You should see her.
She might be good for the movie.

642
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,291
This one... you she-devil...

643
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:13,957
lt's true. She's tall like me
standing on the bed.

644
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,457
See?

645
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,582
She's twice been voted
Miss Nylon Stockings.

646
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,582
ls Guido in there? I'm coming in.

647
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,832
Sleep, ConoCchia, sleep.
l'll see you tomorrow.

648
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,832
May l ask you a question?

649
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:25,332
Go ahead.

650
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:30,499
My friend here says...
you can't make a love story.

651
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,207
- Shut up!
- She's right.

652
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,291
Should I wake you up
in the morning, Guido?

653
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:36,249
No, thanks.

654
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,457
Our commander will never
catch us unprepared.

655
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,416
This production crew never sleeps!

656
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,374
Such a splitting headache.
What did l eat?

657
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,374
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

658
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,791
Do you need anything, Guido?
ls it a new idea?

659
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:55,291
Do you have something to tell me?

660
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:57,166
No, thank you, no.

661
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,957
Go baCk to bed.
l don't need anything.

662
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:01,416
- Anything at all.
- No, thank you. Good night.

663
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,874
Good night my ass!

664
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:07,707
Who can sleep here?
How can l get any sleep?

665
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,749
ConocChia, Calm down.

666
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,291
Allow me. l have been in this
business for 30 years,

667
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:16,207
l've worked on movies
you couldn't begin to imagine

668
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,124
and l have never been afraid
of anything!

669
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,957
What are you shouting for,
you crazy old man!

670
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,291
There, you've said it now. Old.

671
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:27,499
finally you've spat it out.
ConocChia is old.

672
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,916
What do you want?
Get baCk inside.

673
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,541
You always keep me in the dark.
l never know what to do.

674
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,957
When to talk or when to shut up.
l don't want to bother you.

675
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,041
l don't want to know
what this movie is about.

676
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:45,874
- You want to keep it a secret? Go ahead.
- Please, go back to bed.

677
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:48,041
But if I'm to help you out,
as I've always done,

678
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,124
and you were so happy then,
you must tell me something!

679
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:53,457
Tell me: get rid
of the frenCh woman...

680
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:56,499
this is how I want the spaceship...
tell me: go hang yourself,

681
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,707
but do tell me something.

682
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,416
You've Changed so much,
Guido my friend.

683
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:07,916
What are you doing now?
Crying? Aren't you ashamed?

684
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,666
l'll be leaving tomorrow.
l'm quitting.

685
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:14,499
l don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

686
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,707
Just be careful. You're not
the man you used to be, either.

687
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,707
A crisis of inspiration?

688
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:48,874
And what if it weren't a
passing one, my dear?

689
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,374
What if it's the final collapse
of a filthy liar

690
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,082
with no flair or talent? Sgulp!

691
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,707
Let's say you are purity itself.

692
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,041
But what the hell does it mean
to be really honest?

693
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,041
Didn't you hear
what the falcaccio said?

694
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:38,957
"lt's time to set all the symbols aside,
the echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

695
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,332
What is it you want then?

696
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:58,999
Yes, this could be it.

697
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,749
There's a museum in the town,
and you, the guard's daughter,

698
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:07,832
grew up surrounded by images
of ancient beauty...

699
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,166
You're right.

700
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,707
l've come to stay forever.

701
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:14,249
l want to create order,
l want to cleanse...

702
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,291
Hello?

703
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:28,166
They're asking for you
from the Railway Hotel.

704
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:29,541
fine. I'll take it.

705
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:35,082
Hello? Who's that? Hello?

706
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,166
Guido, I feel dreadful.
The mineral water made me sick.

707
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:42,249
l have a temperature. Come.
Come here, immediately.

708
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,582
At this time of night?
l Can't. I'll Come tomorrow.

709
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:46,666
Come.

710
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,957
The poor thing, if you only knew
how she was asking for you.

711
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,082
Here's the ice.

712
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:57,249
- She's melting. She's got at least 104.
- Yes, fine. Just go now.

713
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,291
- Should I bring the peas?
- What peas?

714
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,082
When she was delirious
she asked for peas. It's a good sign.

715
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,916
No, just forget about it.

716
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:09,499
- If you need anything, let us know.
- Yes, thanks.

717
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:20,041
Carla, is this the first time you've run
such a high fever so suddenly?

718
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:28,249
No. lt shoots up over nothing.

719
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,374
Then it goes away.
My husband is used to it.

720
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,207
lt doesn't scare him

721
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,541
No, don't get up.
Stay under the covers.

722
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:41,832
- I'm so hot. I'm thirsty.
- Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.

723
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,416
Drink slowly or you'll get
all bloated!

724
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,749
- Is it day or night?
- What are you talking about?

725
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,832
lt's four o'Clock in the afternoon.

726
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,499
Listen, now we'll wait for the
doctor and see what he has to say.

727
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,707
lt wouldn't be a bad idea to send
your husband a telegram.

728
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:04,374
We can't take full responsibility for this.
Yes, he ought to know.

729
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:08,749
No, l don't want it to be over.
lf he comes, he'll take me away.

730
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,374
And l have bought
so many niCe little dresses.

731
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,249
Why did you gorge on
all that water?

732
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,499
That's for sick people.
Are you sick?

733
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,291
You're always ready when
there's something to gorge on.

734
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:23,457
What else should I do?
You're always leaving me here alone.

735
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:28,457
l drafted my will two years ago.

736
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:33,499
Anyway, it's not like you die sooner
just beCause you make a will.

737
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,374
You see, I have a brother
and a sister too,

738
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:42,291
but I'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

739
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,249
lt's mine, but how would
the poor thing manage with out it...

740
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,374
even if he does get remarried?

741
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,499
Ah, these sheets!

742
00:57:53,458 --> 00:58:00,041
Listen, tell me the truth,
the truth, you hear?

743
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,124
Why do you stay with me?

744
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,791
What Can l tell the Cardinal tomorrow?

745
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:13,249
Yes, l did read the little synopsis
your producer sent us.

746
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:16,291
lt's very interesting.
from a factual point of view though,

747
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,791
the meeting between
the protagonist

748
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:21,457
and a prince of the church could
not happen during a mud treatment

749
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:25,041
as you describe it.
l'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.

750
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:27,499
A high prelate has his
own private room.

751
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,416
True, but l was looking for
an unconventional setting.

752
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:31,457
What do you mean?

753
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:34,332
The protagonist received
a Catholic upbringing and...

754
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,791
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

755
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,416
Nice to meet you.
You must be the director.

756
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,582
Yes.

757
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,541
ls the subjeCt of this film
a religious one?

758
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,332
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

759
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:49,249
As I was saying, the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

760
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,082
like all of us, for that matter.
So, he has Certain complexes,

761
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,957
certain needs he Can no
longer repress.

762
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:58,541
And a prince of the church appears to him
like the depositary of a truth

763
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:00,832
that he can no longer aCcept
although it still fasCinates him.

764
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,124
So, he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps a flash of understanding.

765
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,832
Saul in Damascus, right?

766
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,791
Don't we all harbor such hopes?

767
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:11,624
l do realize the idea might sound a
bit superficial, gothic if you want...

768
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,499
No, no, that's not it.

769
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,582
l don't believe cinema
lends itself well to certain topics.

770
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:22,124
You mix saCred
and profane love too casually.

771
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,791
lsn't that so?
- Maybe.

772
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,124
Yours is a great responsibility.

773
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:29,374
You can either corrupt
or eduCate thousands of souls.

774
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,916
His EminenCe
will listen to you all the same.

775
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,374
You can ask him some questions.

776
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:41,416
Allow me to introduce you
to the director.

777
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:45,207
Please, do sit down.

778
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,416
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume,

779
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:54,582
But my producer is restless,
perhaps he's right,

780
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,332
and he insisted that I...

781
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:59,249
- Are you married?
- Yes.

782
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:02,582
- Any Children?
- Yes. I mean, no.

783
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,082
- How old are you?
- 43.

784
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,791
- Do you hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

785
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:15,416
- Do you know what it's Called?
- No.

786
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,166
lt's called Diomedeo.

787
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:22,291
The legend has it that
when Diomedes died,

788
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:26,457
all these little birds gathered
and acCompanied him to his grave

789
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,541
singing a funeral lamentation.

790
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:34,082
Hear? It sounds like wailing.

791
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:14,374
Guido, Guido let's go see
the Saraghina.

792
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:19,791
Coming.

793
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:55,541
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.

794
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:58,416
Here.

795
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:49,999
Shame on you, shame on you...

796
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,541
lt's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

797
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:55,374
l don't believe it, it Can't be true...

798
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:59,874
Look at your mother, look at her!

799
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,499
- Mother.
- Stop there.

800
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:09,124
Oh God, I'm so ashamed,
so ashamed and hurt!

801
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,082
But above all, during his whole life
and in any place where he lived,

802
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:54,124
the pious Luigi most abhorred
any talk or dealing with women,

803
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,999
whose presence he avoided
in such a way that whoever

804
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,249
saw him thought he had a natural
dislike of them...

805
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,374
Get down!

806
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,749
Don't you know that Saraghina
is the devil?

807
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:39,291
No, l didn't. l really did not.

808
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,707
So, what does it mean?

809
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:53,624
lt's a character inspired by
your childhood memories.

810
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,874
No connection with a real
critical consCience.

811
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,332
No, if you really want to make
a polemical piece

812
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:05,249
about the ltalian Catholic
consciousness, you would need

813
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:10,332
a much higher degree of culture

814
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,457
as well as inexorable logic and clarity.

815
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:21,791
forgive me, but...
your naivete is a serious failing.

816
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:25,541
Your little memories,
bathed in nostalgia,

817
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:28,707
your inoffensive and fundamentally
sentimental evocations

818
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,249
are all the expressions
of an aCcomplice...

819
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:33,291
"How?" said the parish priest,
"With a communist?"

820
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,249
See? He didn't say: 'a man'.

821
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,499
Catholic conscienCe?

822
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:43,999
Just think what Suetonious was
at the time of the Caesars!

823
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:50,874
No, your intention was to denounce,
but you end up

824
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:53,416
supporting it like an acComplice.

825
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,874
See? What Confusion...
what ambiguity!

826
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:08,124
Dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!

827
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,249
But you don't need me anymore.

828
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,166
That isn't true, absolutely not true.

829
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:15,416
127: showers and mud treatments.

830
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:18,166
129: massages.

831
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,874
1 31 : inhalations.

832
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,416
Hello, Commendatore.

833
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:45,749
You know, I've figured out
what you're trying to talk about...

834
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:50,791
Man's inner confusion.
But you've got to be clearer.

835
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:55,707
You have to make yourself understood.
Otherwise what's the use of it?

836
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:58,624
Let's go, Guido.

837
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,374
lf what you have to say
is interesting,

838
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,249
it must be so for everybody.

839
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,416
How can you not Care
if audiences understand?

840
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,499
l'm sorry, but that is
arrogant and presumptuous

841
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:24,832
Commendatore, let's go over there.
lnhale. Breathe deeply.

842
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:25,791
Hi, Guido.

843
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,207
l've saved you a spot by the jet.

844
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,207
l went to the spaCeship this morning

845
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,916
and it's already gone up 50 meters...

846
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,374
Mario.

847
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:20,207
Guido, his Eminence is
waiting for you. l repeat.

848
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:24,791
His EminenCe is waiting.

849
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,999
Get dressed, quiCkly.

850
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,249
The Cardinal is already waiting.

851
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,291
Tell him everything.

852
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:33,999
Confess everything,
don't hide anything

853
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:38,332
and if you have any spare time just
put in a good word for me too.

854
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:41,749
lt's a golden opportunity, Guido.
The Cardinal! You're so lucky.

855
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,999
He can give dispensations for anything...

856
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,832
Remember my divorce in Mexico City.
Get me my MexiCan divorce.

857
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,332
He won't say no to you.

858
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,582
And above all show you're devout,
throw yourself down on your knees,

859
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,499
kiss his ring, cry,
say you've repented.

860
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:59,582
Getting in their good graces means
you can have anything you want in life.

861
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:00,666
Listen to me.

862
01:12:00,667 --> 01:12:04,207
Careful, Guido. We're in your hands.

863
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,166
You only get five minutes.

864
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,499
Your Eminence, I'm not happy.

865
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:37,666
Why should you be?
That isn't yourjob.

866
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:43,624
Who told you we Come into the world
to be happy?

867
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:51,124
Origen says in his homilies:
Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.

868
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:55,582
There's no salvation outside
the church.

869
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,666
Extra Ecclesiam, nemo salvatur.

870
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:04,249
No one will meet salvation,
outside the Church.

871
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:10,749
Salus extra Ecclesiam, non est.

872
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:15,624
There's no salvation outside
the church.

873
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:21,916
Civitas dei. He who isn't
in the City of God,

874
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:26,207
belongs to the City of the Devil.

875
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,749
Come see this great
human phenomenon, the fakir Siva,

876
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,332
who has broken all
previous reCords...

877
01:13:56,333 --> 01:14:00,457
our experiment is controlled daily
by European experts...

878
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:30,332
20,000... 22... 23,000...
and the lady in the back?

879
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:33,707
25,000? Very well,
the bid is 24,000.

880
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,582
Do I hear 30,000?

881
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:41,416
Splendid. 35,000... 40,000.
Going, going...

882
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:46,832
One more offer?
50,000, the bid is 50,000...

883
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:10,041
- When did you get here?
- Around five.

884
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:12,707
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

885
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,541
How are you?
- Fine, fine.

886
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,207
Who did you come with?

887
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:20,249
With Rossella and EnriCo.
Tilde's here too.

888
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,332
Good girl. You actually Came.
You look good, you know?

889
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:30,707
Hey there, Rossa.

890
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:34,166
lt's been a year sinCe
we last danCed together.

891
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:39,416
Luisa, darling. You're my treasure.

892
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:43,249
l'm so happy you came.
lt's always the same.

893
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,041
As soon you're away...

894
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,499
You feel lonely.

895
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,457
ls it true? Did you miss me?
- Yes.

896
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:55,707
You weren't enjoying the company
of all these lovely ladies?

897
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,457
So you've notiCed them...

898
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,957
No flings since you left?

899
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,832
Poor Guido.
And your famous virility?

900
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,082
- You smell so good.
- Do you like it?

901
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,291
You're so light.

902
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,499
And how's your project going?
Better?

903
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,249
Well, I don't think l've had
any major breakthroughs.

904
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:17,957
But what's it about?
What are you up to this time?

905
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,207
Oh, sorry.

906
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:26,291
Listen, am I mistaken
or has EnriCo fallen for you?

907
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,791
She's adorable, isn't she?

908
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:41,832
Bravo. Very good.

909
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:43,624
Evening signora.
So nice to have you here.

910
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,582
Thanks.

911
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,666
Maestro, we're at your service.
Should we get going?

912
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:49,874
l'm coming.

913
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,957
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

914
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:55,249
the depths of insanity
a producer Can fall into.

915
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,624
frankly, I'd rather not
shake hands with this one.

916
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:01,582
The moment she touches you
she knows what you're thinking.

917
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,999
Who else could it be?

918
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,832
Your guiding spirit.

919
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:08,207
Haven't you reached
that stage of intimacy yet?

920
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,041
- May I introduce my sister?
- Ah, the beautiful little sister!

921
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:14,082
You see the kind of women
your director attracts?

922
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,249
Delighted to meet you,
Commendatore.

923
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:18,207
l just finished a sCreenplay
about nuclear warfare.

924
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,832
Only a producer of your courage
could get it made.

925
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,582
Does the beautiful sorceress
belong to your harem too?

926
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,832
let's say I'm a sort of overseer.

927
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:31,499
So are you any better?
Has your isolation helped?

928
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,374
You do look better.
- Really?

929
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:37,749
No. Just kidding. Are you better?
Actually, I was a little worried.

930
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,541
lt was good of you to ask Luisa to Come.

931
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:41,374
The very thought made her happy.

932
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:44,957
lf you don't mind l'd rather not come.
My presence is futile.

933
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:49,457
- Suit yourself.
- No, my friend. I insist. Get in Conocchia's car.

934
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:51,541
Sweetie move it, go with Laura.

935
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,249
- Where's your wife?
- I don't know. She was just here.

936
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,499
Rossella, come with us.

937
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,832
Yes, l want to tell you
a strange story.

938
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:02,082
My sister was a nun.
She died very young

939
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:06,999
and one night her portrait
suddenly changed its expression.

940
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,832
Please, get in.

941
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,457
Changed as if it wanted to warn me
about some danger...

942
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,999
l'll sit in the front.

943
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,749
So a couple days later
my unCle says,

944
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,374
Let's go to the market, kid.

945
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:22,957
He drove an Isotta fraschini...
l was recounting a premonition...

946
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:51,291
So what do you think?

947
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:54,249
You have to be a little Crazy
to listen to this director.

948
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:56,041
Bundle up. It's damp.

949
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,874
Renato, where are you?

950
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,916
Here, Commendatore.

951
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,499
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

952
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,957
follow me, ladies.
Careful. The ground is bumpy.

953
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:14,291
lt seems to me we're a bit behind.
- No. We're already up to 70 meters.

954
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:15,457
Listen, what's up with Luisa?

955
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,957
She's changed all of a sudden.
She's turned so nervous and angry.

956
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,416
l don't know. She was so happy
to come see you.

957
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:22,041
You might have said something
that upset her.

958
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:24,207
- Never.
- And what's this?

959
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,541
l find this extraordinarily fasCinating.

960
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:30,207
This model will be
superimposed on the structure,

961
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,457
to create the illusion that
the roCket is on the launch pad.

962
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:33,999
- Am I right?
- Right.

963
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,041
This is the rocket's launCh pad.

964
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:40,791
The most important moment
in the movie.

965
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,874
No photos.
- Just one, Commendatore.

966
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:49,041
What is your husband up to this time?
ScienCe fiction?

967
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:51,207
What do I know? Ask him.

968
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,582
Giancarlo wrote him
such a beautiful story about Martians.

969
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,832
What is this amusement park for?

970
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,999
You have no idea what
a job this was.

971
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,374
No construCtion Company
wanted to take it on.

972
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:05,124
lt rests entirely on sand.

973
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:07,624
How much Concrete did it take?

974
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,999
Tons! 400 tons.

975
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,166
Commendatore, if you don't mind,

976
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:17,374
l'll stop at the end of this
first flight. l have vertigo.

977
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:20,124
for 80 million you could buy
at least ten apartments.

978
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,791
lt's a pompous shaCk, just like him.

979
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:26,582
The little sister-in-law is not
exactly tender with our director.

980
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,291
Maybe she's in love with him.
- With him?

981
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:31,249
l pray day and night
that l'll be spared a husband like him.

982
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,916
What now? More climbing?

983
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,791
l'd be glad to Carry you.

984
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:39,374
When I think he made me spend
80 million on this structure.

985
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:42,749
Wouldn't a well-crafted backdrop
have been better?

986
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,666
A backdrop! That's out of
your grandfather's time.

987
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:48,707
Besides, are they your millions,
ConocChia?

988
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:54,249
Luisa, are you cold?
Take my jaCket.

989
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,249
No, no. Thank you.

990
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,957
Anyway, we're going
back to the hotel.

991
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,957
ls something wrong?

992
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:07,749
You've gotten sad all of a sudden.
Am l wrong?

993
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:11,957
No. l'm not sad at all.

994
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,624
The sequenCe starts with an image
of planet Earth

995
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:21,874
completely wiped out
by a thermonuclear war...

996
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:25,749
Guido seemed glad to see you,
really.

997
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:30,124
...and the spaceship, our new Noah's Ark,
tries to escape, while the rest of humanity

998
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,957
seeks refuge on another planet.

999
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:36,707
More than 1 0,000 extras,
even 1 5,000, a tragic crowd.

1000
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:41,457
We're really going to see all this
in your movie?

1001
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:46,249
The prophet is raising his voice.
He's deCided to scare everybody.

1002
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:50,207
Why not? Don't tell me you also love
movies where nothing happens?

1003
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:53,416
ln my movie I have all
sorts of things happen.

1004
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:57,166
l'm putting everything in.
Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1005
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:58,916
Sailor, come here.

1006
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,832
What did you learn in AmeriCa?

1007
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,916
No, l don't want water.
Dance and I'll give you a part.

1008
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:06,082
Dance.

1009
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:16,499
What's up with you?
What's going on?

1010
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,832
Rossella, cut the big sister tone.
lt puts me off right away.

1011
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:24,124
Mr. Director, what part do l get?

1012
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,832
What does Luisa think about me?
What does she want to do?

1013
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,707
What's my part? My part?

1014
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:35,999
Go away!

1015
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,999
You know Luisa.
She doesn't say much.

1016
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,249
Not even to me,
and l'm her best friend.

1017
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,999
l really don't know. She's lost.

1018
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,249
One day she says one thing,
another day, something else.

1019
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,916
Unfortunately, I think the only
thing she'd like

1020
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:53,041
is for you to be someone else.

1021
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:54,249
Why?

1022
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,582
lt's the mistake everyone makes.

1023
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:03,541
But that kind little fellow,
is he in love with her?

1024
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:07,957
You'd like that, so your conscience
won't gnaw at you anymore.

1025
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,707
You're such a scoundrel.

1026
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:15,416
Poor Enrico, he's so awkward.
Everybody's noticed.

1027
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,291
He hangs around, listens to her,
keeps her company.

1028
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:20,749
He's a great friend.

1029
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,207
l thought my ideas were so Clear.

1030
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:31,791
l wanted to make an honest film.
No lies whatsoever.

1031
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:36,749
l thought I had something
so simple to say.

1032
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:40,291
Something useful to everybody.

1033
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,666
A film that could help to bury forever

1034
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:46,082
all those dead things
we carry within ourselves.

1035
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:52,749
lnstead, I'm the one without the courage
to bury anything at all.

1036
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:59,041
And now I'm utterly confused.
This launch pad to deal with...

1037
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,999
l wonder why things turned out
this way.

1038
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,916
When did l go wrong?

1039
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,999
l really have nothing to say...

1040
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,374
but I want to say it all the same.

1041
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,791
And your spirits,
why don't they come to my rescue?

1042
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,416
You always said they had
plenty of messages for me.

1043
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,082
Let them get to work!

1044
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:30,999
l've already told you,
your attitude is wrong,

1045
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,749
Your curiosity toward them is childish.

1046
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:36,166
You want too many guarantees.

1047
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:40,707
- Fine, but what do they say?
- Always the same thing. Even now.

1048
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:44,457
They're very reasonable spirits.
They know you very well.

1049
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:45,749
So?

1050
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:51,207
They say you're free,
but you must learn to choose.

1051
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:55,874
You don't have muCh time.
And you have to hurry.

1052
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:02,999
Guido, are you coming up?
Yes or no?

1053
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,124
Room 320, please.

1054
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,457
Nobody's in.

1055
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,416
fine, thanks.

1056
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,207
Have you got a headache?

1057
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,374
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1058
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,541
Do you take them often?

1059
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,832
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1060
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,541
What's worrying you now?

1061
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,374
What?

1062
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:21,582
Nothing.
lf you Could only see yourself.

1063
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,041
Why are you laughing?

1064
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,707
l don't think l Could ever betray you,
if only because l Couldn't bear

1065
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:31,749
the ridiCulous effort
of having to hide and lie.

1066
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:34,541
But obviously it's easy for you.

1067
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:38,374
Listen Luisa.
l am very happy you're here,

1068
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:42,124
but I am very tired and sleepy.

1069
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:49,916
Sleep then. Good night.

1070
01:27:56,542 --> 01:28:00,082
l don't know what you think my
life is like, reducing it all

1071
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:02,457
to the pettiness of somebody
stealing from the Cookie jar.

1072
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:06,332
What do you know about my life?
What I hate and what I don't.

1073
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,332
l only know what you show me.

1074
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:13,999
What am l showing you?

1075
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:17,207
Come on, tell me what you see.

1076
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,499
You and yourjudgmental moralism.
What are you getting at?

1077
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,249
Nothing. I know we've
been stagnating for years.

1078
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,666
But it's you; you're the one
who always calls me back

1079
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:30,124
and wants to start all over again.

1080
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,916
Once and for all, I don't want
to restart anything.

1081
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:34,374
But what do you want?

1082
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:38,124
Why did you want me here?
What good am l to you?

1083
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:42,374
What are you trying to get from me?
What is it you want?

1084
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:06,082
Don't fret. I'd already spotted
her last night when I got in.

1085
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,416
l've asked no questions,
so don't say a word.

1086
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:21,666
Spare me the embarrassment
of having to listen to your lies.

1087
01:30:26,042 --> 01:30:28,124
She must have been born
in MarCh or April.

1088
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:31,332
She's got all the characteristics
of an Aries. She's the Aries type.

1089
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,499
l'll tell you what type she is.

1090
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:37,457
Exactly the type most likely to make

1091
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:42,082
a good companion for feeble,
spineless, confused men.

1092
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,166
Luisa, I didn't know.

1093
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:48,957
l'm seeing her for the first time,
like you.

1094
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:52,749
Really, in a place like this,
where there are so many people,

1095
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,832
it's no surprise to run into the poor thing.

1096
01:30:58,042 --> 01:31:01,291
So this is why you've been
tormenting me since last night.

1097
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,957
You should have told me.

1098
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,249
What annoys me most is
that people Could think

1099
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,749
l'd go with somebody who
dresses that way.

1100
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,124
Have you seen her clothes?

1101
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:14,041
Listen, can't we go for a walk?

1102
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:15,624
Let's not talk about this anymore.

1103
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:19,082
lt's been over for three years.
finished. Enough.

1104
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:25,332
He drives me crazy.
He pretends he's telling the truth.

1105
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:29,041
He acts honest.
As if he's the one who's right.

1106
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:32,624
How can you live this way?

1107
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,499
lt's not right living this way,

1108
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,957
not letting others know
what's true and what's false.

1109
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,749
ls it possible that for you
it's all the same? How?

1110
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:45,041
You're right. I know, I'm boring.

1111
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:51,082
How sad having to play
the bourgeois wife who doesn't understand.

1112
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:53,166
You tell me, what should I do.

1113
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:55,249
l really can't laugh about it
the way you do.

1114
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,249
No darling, I'm not laughing.

1115
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:02,249
What do you tell her?

1116
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:10,791
What disgusts me the most is that
you've mixed her up in our life.

1117
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:13,457
She knows everything
about you and me.

1118
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,707
That whore. Cow!

1119
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:23,457
You're a real pain, you know.

1120
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:32,749
And yet...

1121
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,707
Signora Carla, you sing so well.

1122
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:00,624
No, l'm just an amateur.

1123
01:33:00,792 --> 01:33:02,457
And how pretty you look.

1124
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:06,916
l've wanted to meet you for so long.
- And I, you.

1125
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:14,791
You're so stylish.

1126
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:18,999
No, you're the stylish one.
Me, frankly, I'm a bit trashy.

1127
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,749
What are you talking about?
This is so refined.

1128
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,666
Do you like it?

1129
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:23,791
lt's a little outfit I found in Vogue.
- Really?

1130
01:33:23,792 --> 01:33:25,832
lf you only knew how long
it took me to find it.

1131
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,874
But you know,
when Carla wants something...

1132
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:44,582
Here he comes!

1133
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,291
Guido's here.

1134
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,957
Good evening, women.

1135
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,207
Close the door, there's a storm.

1136
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,207
How are you? Well?

1137
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:57,332
Every gift comes with its nametag.

1138
01:33:57,333 --> 01:34:00,082
Don't get mixed up.
This is Caterina's.

1139
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:02,207
He's a darling!

1140
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,832
And this one is for my darling sister-in-law,

1141
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,832
because she's finally understood
how things should be.

1142
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,624
We'll draw your bath right away.

1143
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:11,541
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1144
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:14,499
Thanks. I need to talk to you, Guido.

1145
01:34:15,292 --> 01:34:17,624
l know what she wants to tell you.

1146
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,374
Now we'll have to send her away
because she's acting jealous.

1147
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,791
What were you doing upstairs?

1148
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:26,749
l went to see those poor things.
They'd always be alone, if not for me.

1149
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:30,291
The role doesn't suit her.
She's only a common bourgeoise.

1150
01:34:30,292 --> 01:34:31,582
She has no Class.

1151
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:34,332
Leave him alone now.
He's got to take his bath.

1152
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,624
Oh Guido, this is splendid,
l've always wanted one like it.

1153
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:40,124
Hurry, Carla, Hedy!
Get the buckets.

1154
01:34:43,167 --> 01:34:45,249
Guido, my husband wrote.

1155
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:48,291
He wants me home for New Year's,
just for a day, do you mind?

1156
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:51,499
lf you do, l'll tell him I can't.
- I think that will be fine.

1157
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,791
Come on, Carlotta!

1158
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,666
- Who's that little black girl?
- A surprise from us.

1159
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:02,624
She's from Hawaii,
don't you remember her?

1160
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,916
You told us about her
so many times.

1161
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:13,541
Thank you, Luisa. You're so kind.

1162
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,707
Such a delicate little present.

1163
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,332
That tiara is mine.

1164
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:27,457
Yes, l know.
l'll give it back to you later.

1165
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:29,832
Oh, darling!

1166
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,749
What a thrill to find you here.

1167
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,916
- How are you?
- Fine.

1168
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:39,457
But do tell me, who are you?

1169
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:42,749
The name doesn't matter.
l'm happy to be here.

1170
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,457
Don't ask me any questions.
- Can I stay?

1171
01:35:45,458 --> 01:35:49,666
Of course, you pretty thing.
l'm busy now.

1172
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:51,249
But later?

1173
01:35:54,083 --> 01:35:56,499
Rossella?
What are you doing here?

1174
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,999
Playing PinoCchio's wise cricket.
Do you mind?

1175
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,332
No. But why are you laughing?

1176
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:03,249
lt's nothing. l just want to see
how you get out of this one.

1177
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:06,707
You've finally got your harem,
King Solomon!

1178
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,041
- It was high time.
- Sure was.

1179
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:14,749
Lower me down.

1180
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:18,291
Aren't you a little sCared?

1181
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,874
Of what? Everything is going great.

1182
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,457
Can l stay too? l'm having suCh fun.

1183
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:24,791
l don't want anything.
l'll just watch you.

1184
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,999
We have rules that must be
respeCted. Do you know that?

1185
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,082
Come, help me.

1186
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:34,999
lt's a two piece suit with a busby
in ostriCh feathers. Do you like it?

1187
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,457
Hi Hedy, it's beautiful.

1188
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:40,291
So, what are the rules?

1189
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:43,624
l don't know. He promised me
a part in his movie and said

1190
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:45,916
l'd have to change dresses a lot.

1191
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:53,541
Girls, that's enough. Get me out.

1192
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:58,207
- Gloria, the talcum powder.
- Ah, yes.

1193
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:03,207
Guido, do you know she prepared
something just the way you like it?

1194
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:05,541
- Really?
- A cake.

1195
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:08,166
- Are you happy, girls?
- Of course!

1196
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,916
lsn't this just what
you always wanted?

1197
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:13,166
Certainly! lsn't he the best
kid in the world?

1198
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:15,541
Nadine, hurry up with the powder!

1199
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:19,166
Oh Nadine, what was it you used
to say in Copenhagen?

1200
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,624
We're delighted to invite
our passengers

1201
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:24,916
to spend the night in Copenhagen
due to a problem with the motor.

1202
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:27,666
Just listen to her voice...

1203
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:30,249
The company will cover
all expenses.

1204
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,666
Good night to you all.

1205
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,416
Madeleine, Come help us.

1206
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:44,791
- Saraghina!
- Here I am. I'll carry Guido.

1207
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:48,291
Oh, my poor man. The water was
sCalding. He's turned all red!

1208
01:37:48,292 --> 01:37:52,499
- Such nice, thin legs.
- Straight like when he was a boy.

1209
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,249
He likes to act like a kid,
but he's really very complex.

1210
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,916
Don't be fooled. I'm onto him.
He's a hypocrite.

1211
01:37:57,917 --> 01:37:59,416
No, he's not.

1212
01:37:59,417 --> 01:38:01,332
But why does he have to tell
everything to anybody?

1213
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,957
He knows how to stand up
for himself.

1214
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:06,499
Guido, help me.

1215
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,874
Who's sCreaming like that?

1216
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:10,374
Jacqueline. She refuses to
go upstairs with the old ones,

1217
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:13,374
so we've locked her in the cellar.

1218
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:17,041
lt's scandalous. I don't want to
have to speak to those witches,

1219
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:21,832
so muCh older than me. I'm 26.
Go to the Paris public register.

1220
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:28,707
Jacqueline Bon Bon, 26,
the 4th of July 1938.

1221
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:31,874
You have no right
to send me upstairs.

1222
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:36,166
lt's not my time yet.
Look, I'm so agile. Look at my legs.

1223
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:41,207
Which one of you has such a tight
little ass? Look at my chest.

1224
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:45,666
Guido, don't send me upstairs.
l don't want to go upstairs.

1225
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:50,249
You know the rules.
The rules are the rules.

1226
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,999
Guido I...

1227
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,207
Calm down. Apparently
it's nice upstairs, too.

1228
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:57,124
- Your earring. Here.
- Thank you.

1229
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:04,457
You've always loved me. Please,
tell him to give me an extension.

1230
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:07,416
Guido, couldn't we give her
an extension?

1231
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:09,999
What are you doing?
You're breaking my balls too?

1232
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,582
l beg you Guido, just for one year.

1233
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:16,582
- No extension.
- I'm not going upstairs.

1234
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,207
- What did you say?
- I'm not going upstairs.

1235
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,916
- Say it again if you dare.
- I'm not going upstairs!

1236
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:25,041
This one is Crazy. I told you we
should never have let her in.

1237
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,082
Hey, girl!
Just look at your rulebook.

1238
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:29,874
Whoever passes the age limit
shall be removed to the upper floors,

1239
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:31,916
where she shall be treated equally well,

1240
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:33,791
but shall live basking
in her memories.

1241
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,124
lt's so disgusting, absurd,
we shouldn't have accepted it.

1242
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:38,332
Never, right from the start.

1243
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:44,207
lt's not fair!

1244
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:46,999
These are rules invented
by someone

1245
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,499
who doesn't pass the test himself.

1246
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:54,874
ln France such a man would be
the shame of the nation.

1247
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:57,041
Are we lemons to thrown out
after we're squeezed?

1248
01:39:57,042 --> 01:40:00,291
- Guido, they're so right.
- You're a monster.

1249
01:40:02,667 --> 01:40:05,166
Our time has come!

1250
01:40:05,167 --> 01:40:07,541
Hurray for Jacqueline, who has
shown us the way to our freedom.

1251
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:10,249
Down with the tyrant,
down with Bluebeard!

1252
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:14,207
We have the right to be loved
'til we're 70 years old.

1253
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:17,582
Down with him!

1254
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:20,082
And what do you think you are?
A boy?

1255
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:23,082
Let's say it onCe and for all,
he doesn't know how to make love.

1256
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:25,124
That's the truth.

1257
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:27,082
- And he falls asleep right away.
- I don't sleep. I think.

1258
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:30,332
Guido, don't send us upstairs
when we get old.

1259
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:32,499
Down, down.

1260
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:37,207
Quick!
They're rebelling upstairs too.

1261
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:44,499
Oh, delicious!

1262
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:50,666
You pig, you liar. I came all the
way from Paris. What's my part?

1263
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:59,666
Guido, who will dance for you?
You liked it so much.

1264
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:01,332
l don't like it anymore.

1265
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:03,541
Luisa, help me!

1266
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:06,207
Sorry, but l don't meddle
in my husband's business.

1267
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:09,082
lf this is his decision, it's good.
Those are the rules.

1268
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:11,832
Hurry up Guido, the soup's getting Cold.

1269
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:13,416
Can't you see I'm busy?

1270
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,249
What an extraordinary man.

1271
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,707
Yes, but...

1272
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:21,916
He needs to act this way.
He does it almost every night.

1273
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,832
Guido, do you remember me?

1274
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,457
But darling, you're wounded;
l'll get you some cream...

1275
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,082
- I don't want any cream.
- Some balm.

1276
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,166
- I don't want any balm.
- Drops...

1277
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,582
lt's not true that he dumps you
like squeezed lemons.

1278
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,749
Actually, he'd like to keep you all
with him always.

1279
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,791
He is too good, too patient.

1280
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:46,666
No, not me, no.

1281
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:08,249
He doesn't like you. You're old.

1282
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,499
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy
to have had the opportunity

1283
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:17,666
to live with you and we wish you
the best of luck upstairs.

1284
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:20,374
We'd like to reassure you
on Guido's behalf

1285
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:22,832
that you were the first
showgirl in his life.

1286
01:42:22,833 --> 01:42:26,749
You're now entitled to
a song and dance of your choice,

1287
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:29,541
with your very own spotlight.

1288
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,957
Thank you girls, you're so kind.

1289
01:42:32,958 --> 01:42:35,666
Would you like me
to sing a love song?

1290
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:38,624
No, better something sexy.
That was my speCialty.

1291
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:41,541
Guido, remember
the Apollo theater in Bologna?

1292
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:42,624
Yes, l do.

1293
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:44,457
No, better a happy song!

1294
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:54,082
Oh, l've lost my pearls.

1295
01:43:04,542 --> 01:43:06,166
Oh, again!

1296
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:16,707
You're not even listening.

1297
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:33,457
farewell, Guido.

1298
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:06,874
l thought it was such
a funny situation,

1299
01:44:07,292 --> 01:44:10,374
the funniest part of my story.

1300
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:15,041
l'd even prepared a little
speech to give at the table:

1301
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:21,874
Darlings, happiness is being able
to tell the truth

1302
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:24,332
without ever making anybody suffer.

1303
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:28,457
Carla would have played the harp,
as on any night,

1304
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:31,291
and we would have been happy
hiding in here,

1305
01:44:31,292 --> 01:44:34,374
far away from the world.
All of you and I.

1306
01:44:36,792 --> 01:44:41,707
What's wrong? Why this sadness?

1307
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:45,166
See? We've made him feel guilty.

1308
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:57,291
That's not it, Guido.

1309
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,957
lt has been a wonderful evening.

1310
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:00,332
You mustn't be sad.

1311
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:03,999
Do you need anything?

1312
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:12,916
Now they'll all go to bed
and l still have a lot to do:

1313
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:23,332
the laundry, all the dishes,
mend the sheets, scrub the floors

1314
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:26,541
and set up breakfast for tomorrow.

1315
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:36,457
Aren't we fine living all together this way?

1316
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:40,957
At first I didn't understand,

1317
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:45,124
that this is the way things
are meant to be.

1318
01:45:45,667 --> 01:45:47,666
But now...

1319
01:45:47,875 --> 01:45:50,916
Don't you think I'm good now?
l don't bother you anymore.

1320
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:52,457
l don't ask questions.

1321
01:45:56,292 --> 01:46:00,957
A bit slow, wasn't I?
lt's taken me 20 years to understand.

1322
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:05,624
20 years sinCe the day
we got married

1323
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,582
and you became my husband
and l your wife.

1324
01:46:12,792 --> 01:46:16,166
Do you remember Guido?
Do you remember that day?

1325
01:46:18,792 --> 01:46:22,457
lf you Could only be patient
a little longer, Luisa.

1326
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:24,916
But perhaps you've had it.

1327
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:29,541
frankly, I'd love to be able
to offer a word of adviCe.

1328
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,332
But I think tonight you're Called

1329
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:36,666
to solve a problem
for which there is no solution.

1330
01:46:36,667 --> 01:46:40,082
finding a precise face
for a crowd of characters

1331
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:44,374
that in your script are so rough,
so vague, so superficial...

1332
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,249
What is it we're watching?

1333
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,291
l don't know... screen tests.

1334
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:51,124
You're not well.

1335
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,832
Quite the contrary.

1336
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,957
Agostini, get on the catwalk
and do a little danCe for us.

1337
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:04,541
l'll accompany you on the piano.

1338
01:47:05,375 --> 01:47:07,291
Listen here. "The solitary ego

1339
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:10,332
that revolves around itself
and feeds upon itself, ends up

1340
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:13,332
strangled by a great cry
or a great laugh."

1341
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,082
Words that Stendhal wrote
during his stay in Italy.

1342
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:20,541
lf we sometimes read those sayings
on choColate wrappers

1343
01:47:20,542 --> 01:47:25,291
instead of throwing them away,
we would be spared many an illusion.

1344
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,916
There he is. By the door,
always ready to run away.

1345
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:04,999
Good evening to you all
and apologies for the delay.

1346
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,041
Well, what are you up to now?

1347
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:09,082
- Guido where are you?
- Here.

1348
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:11,041
- Come down.
- I'd rather stay up here.

1349
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:14,832
Evening... Good, you're here too.
Let's get going.

1350
01:48:14,833 --> 01:48:15,916
Right away.

1351
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:20,916
They skipped the variety act tonight
so we Could use the theater.

1352
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:21,874
Let's go.

1353
01:48:22,958 --> 01:48:25,332
Young man, it's time
to make up your mind.

1354
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:27,082
l've brought all the screen tests...

1355
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,291
Pardon me ConoCchia,
but the time for his jokes is over.

1356
01:48:30,292 --> 01:48:32,374
All his doubts, his uncertainties,
his whims.

1357
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:35,499
He had all the time he wanted,
but tonight we're here to Choose.

1358
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,499
- That's why we're all here.
- Right.

1359
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,207
ConocChia has gotten
everything from Rome.

1360
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:42,832
The new and the old sCreen tests,
even the ones we shot five months ago.

1361
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:45,541
Now we'll go through them one by one,
and you have to say:

1362
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:47,874
This is the wife,
this is the mistress,

1363
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:50,749
this is the Cardinal,
this is Saraghina. Clear?

1364
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:53,874
l don't want to be the joke
of the Italian film industry

1365
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:56,666
but above all I don't want you
to end up that way.

1366
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:58,582
They're all ready to shoot you down.

1367
01:48:58,583 --> 01:49:01,582
You've got very few friends left,
on the Left or the Right.

1368
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:04,749
But I am here to help you
each and every way.

1369
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:07,291
We must start shooting
and we must do it immediately.

1370
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:08,832
Roll the screen tests.

1371
01:49:11,875 --> 01:49:13,749
Miss Olimpia's screen test.

1372
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,541
Miss Olimpia...

1373
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:24,374
- Should I shut the door?
- Yes. Sway, sway your big hips.

1374
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:28,124
Put down your stuff. Good.

1375
01:49:28,417 --> 01:49:32,541
Now go to the mirror.
Admire yourself.

1376
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:39,624
More. Swell your chest.
There.

1377
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:42,957
Now go to the phone.
Slowly. Don't run.

1378
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:45,541
- Why are you running?
- I'm not.

1379
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:48,791
Look, hit that mark.
There, on the floor.

1380
01:49:49,917 --> 01:49:52,166
Hello, the concierge please?

1381
01:49:52,542 --> 01:49:53,832
Speaking.

1382
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:57,207
l'd like a bottle of flat water.

1383
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:58,082
fiuggi.

1384
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:59,791
No, fiuggi is sparkling.

1385
01:49:59,792 --> 01:50:03,249
No, look this way.
fiuggi is the least sparkling.

1386
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:04,999
fine, I'll take the fiuggi.

1387
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,749
Will this one do, Guido?

1388
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:09,749
He's got to make up his mind
because she's leaving for England.

1389
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,457
She's leaving next week, Guido.

1390
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:12,916
- And who's this one?
- Shut up, you!

1391
01:50:12,917 --> 01:50:14,874
Or do you prefer this one.

1392
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:16,041
This is an important character.

1393
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:19,999
People need to like her right off the bat.
Right, Guido?

1394
01:50:22,292 --> 01:50:24,249
Signora, sit down
as if you were drained.

1395
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:26,416
This character is a woman who
has lost the desire to fight.

1396
01:50:26,417 --> 01:50:29,082
because... say your line...

1397
01:50:29,875 --> 01:50:30,791
- Without stopping?
- What?

1398
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:32,957
- Without stopping?
- Yes, yes.

1399
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:39,416
l am the one who's offering you
complete freedom.

1400
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:43,749
Anyway, I'm no good to you this way.
l'm just a nuisance.

1401
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:50,166
And who's this?
What should she represent?

1402
01:50:50,167 --> 01:50:52,416
Didn't you hear? She's the wife.

1403
01:50:56,375 --> 01:51:00,082
Still, she's likable, soulful.
Don't you think?

1404
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:04,666
- Gimme a Cigarette.
- I've run out. EnriCo, fill us up.

1405
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:06,582
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1406
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:07,624
You're welcome.

1407
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:10,874
l Cannot go on like this any longer.

1408
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:13,291
Now, you tell me how I should be.

1409
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:15,666
Not someone who lies and swears
he's telling the truth

1410
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,249
every second of the day.

1411
01:51:17,417 --> 01:51:20,499
That would be enough.
You don't even do that.

1412
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,249
With you l never,
never know the truth.

1413
01:51:23,542 --> 01:51:25,499
Even in the smallest things.

1414
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,457
Luisa, I care for you.

1415
01:51:29,167 --> 01:51:31,041
Lying is like breathing to you.

1416
01:51:31,042 --> 01:51:32,499
Repeat that, please.

1417
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,666
Lying is like breathing to you.

1418
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,124
So brazen.

1419
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:43,041
- All lines from his life.
- Right.

1420
01:51:43,042 --> 01:51:46,374
l know this one. She's the prinCess.

1421
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:50,041
Am l not alone already?
What are you giving me?

1422
01:51:50,042 --> 01:51:51,416
What have I got to look
forward to?

1423
01:51:51,417 --> 01:51:53,832
Look this way. Put on the glasses.

1424
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,291
Repeat the last line.

1425
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:57,957
Am l not alone already?

1426
01:51:57,958 --> 01:51:59,916
You have to say it,
yes, aggressively,

1427
01:51:59,917 --> 01:52:01,916
but also with deep bitterness.

1428
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:04,749
He said: What?
You want a separation.

1429
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:05,999
You want to be alone.

1430
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,916
But what would you do on your own?

1431
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:11,999
And she answers: why,
am I not alone already? Go on.

1432
01:52:13,167 --> 01:52:16,957
Guido, there's no doubt
about this one. She's perfect.

1433
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:25,082
five months. We've been going
this way for five months.

1434
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:26,666
But they're all so old!

1435
01:52:28,917 --> 01:52:30,041
fiuggi is sparkling.

1436
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:33,041
No, it's the least sparkling.
Louder.

1437
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:36,874
Put down the phone.

1438
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,874
Screen test for Miss Olimpia.

1439
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:42,124
What about this one?

1440
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:46,832
lt's dangerous leaving me alone.

1441
01:52:48,208 --> 01:52:49,957
Why, what do you do?

1442
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:51,249
Should I repeat the line?

1443
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:57,082
No, just turn your little
head this way. Now, stop.

1444
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,874
Where are you going?

1445
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:03,374
Back to the hotel. I'm sleepy.

1446
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:05,291
Wait a second. Listen.

1447
01:53:05,917 --> 01:53:07,291
What happened?

1448
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,957
Nothing. Nothing ever
happens between us.

1449
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:15,082
Were you offended
by something you saw?

1450
01:53:15,083 --> 01:53:16,041
lt's just a movie.

1451
01:53:16,042 --> 01:53:17,916
l'm the first to understand that.

1452
01:53:17,917 --> 01:53:20,999
lt's a movie, another invention,
another lie.

1453
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,707
You put everybody in it,
but the way you like to see them.

1454
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:25,624
But I know the truth.

1455
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:29,624
The differenCe is that
l would never have the impudence

1456
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:31,957
to tell everybody the way you do.

1457
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:34,124
Go ahead. Make your movie.

1458
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,249
No, l won't.

1459
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:37,666
lndulge yourself. Stroke your ego.

1460
01:53:38,375 --> 01:53:41,166
Go make everyone think
you're so wonderful.

1461
01:53:41,167 --> 01:53:44,249
What Could you ever teach strangers
when you can't

1462
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,707
even tell the simplest truth
to the ones Closest to you?

1463
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:48,457
To the one who's been
growing old with you?

1464
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:50,499
Come on Luisa. Cut the drama.

1465
01:53:52,167 --> 01:53:54,249
You were right to ask me here.

1466
01:53:54,833 --> 01:53:57,207
We needed to find closure.

1467
01:53:57,583 --> 01:54:00,457
This time, l assure you,
l won't be coming back.

1468
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:02,041
You can go to hell!

1469
01:54:15,042 --> 01:54:18,416
fine, just run, run.

1470
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:21,207
Do what the doctor ordered, run!

1471
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:25,916
Shut up! Throw this ignoramus out.

1472
01:54:26,542 --> 01:54:27,999
fine, now sing.

1473
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:32,499
You may say I'm losing it,
but I have the bills here...

1474
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:36,749
l'll never pay this one, never!
ConocChia, you're losing it.

1475
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,749
Saraghina look,
we've got the money.

1476
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,874
Saraghina, the Rumba, the Rumba...

1477
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:46,291
Guido, would you please
say something? Please!

1478
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,874
What about this one, Guido?

1479
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:53,082
frankly I preferred the one before.

1480
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:54,291
This one is from Naples.

1481
01:54:54,458 --> 01:54:58,499
Can't you see that I'm... stuttering.

1482
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:02,082
When are you coming?
l'm tired of waiting.

1483
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:03,207
Look at me.

1484
01:55:03,208 --> 01:55:05,749
Don't leave me alone!
You know it's dangerous.

1485
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:10,374
Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous, darling.

1486
01:55:10,583 --> 01:55:11,582
Look over here.

1487
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:15,249
Why aren't you coming now?
Why are you keeping me waiting?

1488
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:17,374
You know it's dangerous
when I have to wait.

1489
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:19,541
Louder, louder!

1490
01:55:20,125 --> 01:55:21,999
Countess, walk.

1491
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:25,624
Don't touch me.

1492
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:27,624
This way, this way.

1493
01:55:30,042 --> 01:55:32,457
Screen tests Mrs. Grazia, one.

1494
01:55:32,875 --> 01:55:34,499
Just bare your shoulders
all of a sudden.

1495
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,457
Saraghina, we've got the money.
The money.

1496
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:40,749
Stop. Very good. Was it all right?

1497
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:45,374
Signora, what do you think?

1498
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:47,291
lf he won't speak up,
at least we Can say something.

1499
01:55:47,292 --> 01:55:50,874
Somebody say something!
This is a democracy, right?

1500
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:56,624
You can't hide. We've found you
anyway. How are you?

1501
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:59,707
Hi, I'm Poletti,
from Claudia's press agency.

1502
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:02,832
We met 15 years ago.
You might not remember me...

1503
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,582
- Look, she's here.
- Where?

1504
01:56:12,292 --> 01:56:13,541
Excuse me.

1505
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:25,124
- Claudia.
- How are you?

1506
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:28,916
Well, and you?
You're finally here.

1507
01:56:29,125 --> 01:56:31,124
Let's go outside, all right?

1508
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:33,332
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1509
01:56:35,875 --> 01:56:37,957
l'd like to talk to you alone.

1510
01:56:43,167 --> 01:56:45,124
When do we start shooting?

1511
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:47,916
- Soon, very soon.
- And what's my part?

1512
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,791
l'll tell you everything later.

1513
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,707
l'm very happy to be working
with you

1514
01:56:51,708 --> 01:56:53,457
and l hope l'll be able to help you.

1515
01:56:53,458 --> 01:56:55,707
But you must tell me everything.

1516
01:56:56,208 --> 01:56:57,791
Where are we going now?

1517
01:57:07,375 --> 01:57:10,832
Well?
- This way.

1518
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:30,332
You're so beautiful.
l'm at a loss for words.

1519
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:33,374
You make my heart beat
like a school boy's.

1520
01:57:33,792 --> 01:57:35,791
You don't believe me, do you?

1521
01:57:36,167 --> 01:57:38,416
You inspire such deep respeCt.

1522
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:43,041
Who do you love?
Claudia, who are you with?

1523
01:57:43,042 --> 01:57:45,082
- Who do you care for?
- You.

1524
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:50,541
You arrived just in time, you know.

1525
01:57:51,292 --> 01:57:52,999
Why do you smile that way?

1526
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,457
l never know if you're judging me,
absolving me, mocking me.

1527
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:59,499
l'm listening. You said you wanted
to tell me about the film.

1528
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,041
l don't know anything.

1529
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,207
Could you leave everything behind
and start from zero again?

1530
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:15,541
Pick one thing, and one only,
and be absolutely devoted to it?

1531
01:58:15,542 --> 01:58:17,832
Make it the reason for your existence,

1532
01:58:17,833 --> 01:58:20,166
the thing that contains everything,
that beComes everything,

1533
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:24,624
because your dedication to it
makes it last forever? Could you?

1534
01:58:25,292 --> 01:58:28,582
All right, listen.
lf I were to say, Claudia...

1535
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:34,124
Where are we going?
l don't know the way...

1536
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,916
And what about you? Could you?

1537
01:58:37,917 --> 01:58:41,457
The springs must be nearby.
Listen. Turn here.

1538
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,207
No, this guy here, he couldn't.

1539
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:50,832
He wants to grab everything,
can't give up a single thing.

1540
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,166
He changes his mind every day,

1541
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:54,332
because he's afraid he might
miss the right path.

1542
01:58:54,333 --> 01:58:56,499
And he's slowly bleeding to death.
- So this is how the movie ends?

1543
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:57,874
No, this is how it starts.

1544
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:59,916
Then one day he meets the girl
of the spring.

1545
01:58:59,917 --> 01:59:03,666
She's one of those girls that
distributes the healing water,

1546
01:59:03,667 --> 01:59:10,207
she's beautiful, young and ancient,
a child and a woman already,

1547
01:59:10,208 --> 01:59:14,957
authentic and radiant.
There's no doubt that she's his salvation.

1548
01:59:16,583 --> 01:59:18,457
You'll be dressed in white
and your hair will be long,

1549
01:59:18,458 --> 01:59:20,207
just the way you wear it.

1550
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,207
Turn the headlights off.

1551
02:00:10,833 --> 02:00:11,916
And then?

1552
02:00:27,375 --> 02:00:28,707
Let's leave.

1553
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:33,916
l don't like this place.
lt doesn't feel real.

1554
02:00:34,667 --> 02:00:37,249
l like it enormously. Isn't that odd?

1555
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:43,166
l didn't get much from your story.

1556
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,957
A guy like your character,
who doesn't love anybody,

1557
02:00:48,292 --> 02:00:50,582
is not very sympathetiC you know.

1558
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:55,291
lt's his fault.
What does he expect?

1559
02:00:56,875 --> 02:00:58,791
You think l don't know that?

1560
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:02,291
You're a bit of a bore too.

1561
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:05,749
You really can't take the least bit
of critiCism.

1562
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:09,916
You're so funny with that big hat,
made up like an old man.

1563
02:01:12,167 --> 02:01:16,874
l don't understand. He meets a girl
that can give him a new life

1564
02:01:17,417 --> 02:01:18,957
and he pushes her away?

1565
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:21,457
Because he no longer believes in it.

1566
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:24,207
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1567
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:27,041
Because it isn't true that
a woman can change a man.

1568
02:01:27,042 --> 02:01:28,707
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1569
02:01:28,708 --> 02:01:32,207
And above all because I don't feel
like telling another pile of lies.

1570
02:01:32,375 --> 02:01:34,874
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1571
02:01:35,917 --> 02:01:39,957
l'm sorry, Claudia, for making you
come all the way here.

1572
02:01:40,875 --> 02:01:42,957
You're such a fake.

1573
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:45,499
So, there's no part in the film.

1574
02:01:46,042 --> 02:01:49,082
You're right. There isn't.

1575
02:01:49,375 --> 02:01:53,374
And there's no film.
There's nothing anywhere.

1576
02:01:54,042 --> 02:01:57,582
lf it were up to me
we would call it all off now.

1577
02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:04,957
Ah, here you are.

1578
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:08,166
Where did you go?
We're starting next week.

1579
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,291
Your produCer had a great idea.

1580
02:02:11,292 --> 02:02:14,374
The greatest cocktail party ever
to launCh a movie.

1581
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:16,457
And you know where?
- At the launCh pad. Tomorrow afternoon.

1582
02:02:16,458 --> 02:02:18,541
Radio, television,
and all the foreign press.

1583
02:02:18,542 --> 02:02:21,374
Come on, Guido, we're starting for real.

1584
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:47,166
Catch him!

1585
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,249
Let's go. Walk!

1586
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:57,124
l want to go home.

1587
02:02:57,125 --> 02:02:59,582
Here, he's here.

1588
02:03:08,458 --> 02:03:11,499
Guido, where are you going?
lt's over here.

1589
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:19,457
Guido, I'm sure today will be
a beautiful day.

1590
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:28,124
l'm really curious
to finally hear the story...

1591
02:03:29,375 --> 02:03:33,624
Don't you take yourself a little
too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1592
02:03:40,042 --> 02:03:42,624
Leave me alone,
l Can walk by myself.

1593
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:49,624
Good luck!

1594
02:03:52,708 --> 02:03:54,832
Dottore, here he is!

1595
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:59,457
Calm down!

1596
02:03:59,458 --> 02:04:02,624
We've been waiting three days
for you. It's winter already.

1597
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:03,916
Attention, please.

1598
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:13,374
...do you think of pornography
as an art form or...

1599
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:15,916
...is pornography a more
intense form of...

1600
02:04:15,917 --> 02:04:19,416
...why don't you ever make a film
about love?

1601
02:04:32,917 --> 02:04:34,541
l wish to announce that...

1602
02:04:34,542 --> 02:04:36,207
Tomorrow... tomorrow...

1603
02:04:36,583 --> 02:04:39,082
What do you think
you can teaCh us?

1604
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:43,416
Do you really think your life
can be of any interest to others?

1605
02:04:43,417 --> 02:04:46,082
He wants to say something.

1606
02:04:55,458 --> 02:04:58,541
Answer, say something, go on.

1607
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:02,791
Anything at all! Say anything!

1608
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:05,041
Do it for me!

1609
02:05:07,833 --> 02:05:09,249
l promise you...

1610
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:12,916
...this film. And afterward,
what will you live on?

1611
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:16,499
Are you for or against divorCe?
Tell me, frankly...

1612
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,582
ls that your main problem?

1613
02:05:19,583 --> 02:05:21,832
That you can't communiCate?
Or is that just a pretext?

1614
02:05:21,833 --> 02:05:24,541
Your questions betray
a certain hostility.

1615
02:05:24,542 --> 02:05:27,166
l assure you my director
is in great form...

1616
02:05:27,167 --> 02:05:29,499
What should I do?
What am l supposed to do?

1617
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:31,999
...he should be treated with respeCt,
because...

1618
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,499
ConocChia, forgive me
if I treated you badly.

1619
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,541
You were wonderful,
the best of them all.

1620
02:05:37,542 --> 02:05:39,791
He ponders, considers, refleCts.

1621
02:05:40,042 --> 02:05:41,166
Speak! Answer!

1622
02:05:41,167 --> 02:05:43,124
l've paid for your confusion,
your breakdown.

1623
02:05:43,125 --> 02:05:44,749
for months I've been paying
for everything.

1624
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:47,041
Quit this film and I'll ruin you.

1625
02:05:47,292 --> 02:05:49,166
He'll now be at your disposal.

1626
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:50,582
The press always has been...

1627
02:05:50,583 --> 02:05:54,166
Claudia, where are you?
And your spirits, Rossella?

1628
02:05:56,083 --> 02:05:58,749
What should I do? Leave you?
Disappear?

1629
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:00,791
You will never be
what you onCe were.

1630
02:06:00,958 --> 02:06:04,457
Will l ever be your wife?
When will you truly marry me?

1631
02:06:04,458 --> 02:06:07,041
Luisa, is it really true
that you want a separation?

1632
02:06:07,042 --> 02:06:08,166
That you want to leave me?

1633
02:06:08,167 --> 02:06:09,832
How can l go on like this
'til the end?

1634
02:06:09,833 --> 02:06:12,166
...and what does your wife think?

1635
02:06:16,708 --> 02:06:19,499
lt's in your right-hand poCket,
Dottore.

1636
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:20,916
So long, Guido.

1637
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:23,582
l put it in your right-hand poCket.

1638
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:36,166
Nobody gets away with this. Buffoon!

1639
02:06:36,167 --> 02:06:40,041
Out of there, out! You Coward!

1640
02:06:41,042 --> 02:06:45,249
Just a minute, a little moment.
l'm thinking of what to say.

1641
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:48,082
l'm coming... right away!

1642
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:53,207
Such an incurable romantic.

1643
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:00,249
Where are you running, you low-life?

1644
02:07:18,417 --> 02:07:21,291
Take it all down, guys!
The film is off.

1645
02:07:21,292 --> 02:07:24,666
ln two days it all has to be gone.
Start right away.

1646
02:07:24,667 --> 02:07:26,416
Tear it all down. Come on!

1647
02:07:26,417 --> 02:07:28,416
- Is that it, Dottore?
- Yes, thanks.

1648
02:07:28,417 --> 02:07:31,166
So long, guys. See you next time.

1649
02:07:31,542 --> 02:07:32,749
Let's hope so.

1650
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:39,416
So long, sailor.

1651
02:07:43,833 --> 02:07:45,582
You've made the right choice.

1652
02:07:45,583 --> 02:07:48,457
Believe me, today
is a good day for you.

1653
02:07:48,458 --> 02:07:50,832
These are tough decisions, I know.

1654
02:07:51,125 --> 02:07:55,166
But we intellectuals, and I say we
because I consider you such,

1655
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:57,832
must remain lucid to the bitter end.

1656
02:07:58,333 --> 02:08:00,499
This life is so full of confusion already,

1657
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:03,541
that there's no need
to add Chaos to chaos.

1658
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,041
Losing money is part
of a producer's job.

1659
02:08:10,042 --> 02:08:12,791
l Congratulate you.
You had no Choice.

1660
02:08:12,792 --> 02:08:14,707
And he got what he deserved,

1661
02:08:14,708 --> 02:08:18,999
for having joined such a frivolous
venture so lightheartedly.

1662
02:08:20,542 --> 02:08:22,832
Believe me, no need for remorse.

1663
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:24,707
Destroying is better than creating

1664
02:08:24,708 --> 02:08:27,832
when we're not creating those few,
truly necessary things.

1665
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:30,499
But then is there anything
so clear and right

1666
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:33,249
that it deserves to live in this world?

1667
02:08:34,167 --> 02:08:37,291
for him, the wrong movie
is only a financial matter.

1668
02:08:37,292 --> 02:08:41,166
But for you, at this point,
it could have been the end.

1669
02:08:41,375 --> 02:08:44,207
Better to quit
and strew the ground with salt,

1670
02:08:44,208 --> 02:08:47,582
as the ancients did,
to purify the battlefields.

1671
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,041
ln the end what we need is...

1672
02:08:51,042 --> 02:08:54,207
some hygiene, some cleanliness,
disinfeCtion.

1673
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:59,041
We're smothered by images,
words and sounds

1674
02:08:59,042 --> 02:09:04,124
that have no right to exist, coming
from, and bound for, nothingness.

1675
02:09:04,542 --> 02:09:08,999
Of any artist truly worth the name
we should ask nothing

1676
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,249
except this act of faith: to learn silence.

1677
02:09:12,708 --> 02:09:15,416
Do you remember Mallarme's
homage to the white page?

1678
02:09:15,417 --> 02:09:16,791
And Rimbaud...
- Guido, wait!

1679
02:09:16,792 --> 02:09:19,499
...a poet, my friend, not a movie director.
What was his finest poetry?

1680
02:09:19,667 --> 02:09:21,707
We're ready to begin.

1681
02:09:21,708 --> 02:09:25,291
His refusal to continue writing
and his departure for Africa.

1682
02:09:25,292 --> 02:09:26,666
Congratulations.

1683
02:09:26,667 --> 02:09:30,832
lf we Can't have everything,
true perfection is nothingness.

1684
02:09:30,833 --> 02:09:35,791
forgive me for quoting all the time.
But we critiCs... do what we Can.

1685
02:09:36,458 --> 02:09:40,624
Our true mission is... sweeping away
the thousands of miscarriages

1686
02:09:40,625 --> 02:09:45,041
that everyday... obscenely...
try to Come to the light.

1687
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:50,166
And you would actually dare leave
behind you a whole film,

1688
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:54,624
like a Cripple who leaves behind
his crooked footprint.

1689
02:09:55,042 --> 02:09:57,457
Such a monstrous presumption
to think

1690
02:09:57,458 --> 02:10:02,416
that others Could benefit from the
squalid catalogue of your mistakes!

1691
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:05,457
And how do you benefit
from stringing together

1692
02:10:05,458 --> 02:10:06,916
the tattered pieces of your life?

1693
02:10:06,917 --> 02:10:09,791
Your vague memories, the faces of people

1694
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:12,249
that you were never able to love...

1695
02:10:20,667 --> 02:10:23,249
What is this sudden happiness
that makes me tremble,

1696
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:24,999
giving me strength, life?

1697
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:28,582
forgive me, sweet creatures.

1698
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:31,041
l hadn't understood. I didn't know.

1699
02:10:31,333 --> 02:10:34,207
lt's so natural accepting you,
loving you.

1700
02:10:34,208 --> 02:10:35,791
And so simple.

1701
02:10:36,417 --> 02:10:39,332
Luisa, I feel I've been freed.

1702
02:10:39,875 --> 02:10:42,166
Everything seems so good,
so meaningful.

1703
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:43,457
Everything is true.

1704
02:10:43,833 --> 02:10:45,749
l wish I could explain.

1705
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:48,291
But I don't know how to.

1706
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:53,082
So. Everything is Confused again,
as it was before.

1707
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,041
The lights!

1708
02:10:54,208 --> 02:10:55,832
But this confusion is... me.

1709
02:10:55,833 --> 02:10:58,832
Not as I'd like to be, but as I am.

1710
02:10:59,333 --> 02:11:03,332
l'm not afraid anymore
of telling the truth,

1711
02:11:03,333 --> 02:11:07,582
of the things I don't know,
what l'm looking for and haven't found.

1712
02:11:07,583 --> 02:11:09,166
This is the only way I can feel alive

1713
02:11:09,167 --> 02:11:12,582
and l Can look into your faithful
eyes without shame.

1714
02:11:12,583 --> 02:11:14,207
Life is a celebration.

1715
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:15,832
Let's live it together!

1716
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,999
This is all l Can say Luisa,
to you or the others.

1717
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,416
Accept me for what I am,
if you want me.

1718
02:11:22,417 --> 02:11:25,999
lt's the only way we might be able
to find each other.

1719
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,666
l don't know if what
you said to me is right.

1720
02:11:28,667 --> 02:11:31,666
But I can try if you help me.

1721
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:34,457
Just a minute.
l'll give you the go-ahead.

1722
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:47,166
Now. Go to the curtain.

1723
02:12:56,833 --> 02:12:57,832
Draw it.

1724
02:12:59,875 --> 02:13:01,999
Everyone come down.

1725
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,457
Talk to each other.

1726
02:13:55,875 --> 02:13:56,916
Mother.

1727
02:14:02,583 --> 02:14:06,041
Sgulp! I did understand what
you wanted to say, you know.

1728
02:14:06,042 --> 02:14:08,082
That you can't do without us.

1729
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:12,374
At what time will you call me tomorrow?
- Fine, fine. Now join the line!

1730
02:14:12,375 --> 02:14:13,332
MauriCe!

1731
02:14:17,542 --> 02:14:21,666
Come, quickly!
Stop fooling around.

1732
02:14:21,917 --> 02:14:26,582
Everybody hold hands!
Spread out! All together.

1733
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:30,207
Maestro!

1734
02:14:30,833 --> 02:14:33,082
Let's all hold hands!
