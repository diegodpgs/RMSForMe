1
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,550
<i>Kant said human reason is troubled by
questions that it cannot dismiss,</i>

2
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,761
<i>but also cannot answer.</i>

3
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,096
<i>Okay, so, what are we talking about here?</i>

4
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,348
<i>Morality? Choice?</i>

5
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:41,227
<i>The randomness of life?
Aesthetics? Murder?</i>

6
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,194
<i>I think Abe was crazy
from the beginning.</i>

7
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:52,322
<i>Was it from stress? Was it anger?</i>

8
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:56,868
<i>Was he disgusted by what he saw
as life's never-ending suffering?</i>

9
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,703
<i>Or was he simply bored</i>

10
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,956
<i>by the meaninglessness
of day-to-day existence?</i>

11
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,335
<i>He was so damn interesting.
And different.</i>

12
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,878
<i>And a good talker.</i>

13
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,881
<i>And he could always
cloud the issue with words.</i>

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,634
<i>Where to begin?</i>

15
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,886
<i>You know, the existentialists
feel nothing happens</i>

16
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,555
<i>until you hit absolute rock bottom.</i>

17
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,225
<i>Well, let's say that when I went
to teach at Braylin College,</i>

18
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,894
<i>emotionally, I was at Zabriskie Point.</i>

19
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:27,524
<i>Of course, my reputation,
or should I say a reputation, preceded me.</i>

20
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,069
I hear Abe Lucas is gonna be
joinin' the faculty this summer.

21
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,362
Really?

22
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:35,240
That should put some Viagra
into the philosophy department.

23
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,742
He's this really interesting guy,
but he looks totally wasted.

24
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,160
I kind of like the burned-out look, though.

25
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,328
Oh, my God, me too.

26
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,664
Well, yeah, and he has affairs
with some of his students, I heard.

27
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,208
- Really?
- Yeah, like full... Yeah.

28
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,669
Abe Lucas is teaching
my Ethical Strategies class

29
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:48,878
for summer session.

30
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,588
- Have you read any of his papers?
- Mmm-hmm.

31
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,882
He's very radical.
Very original.

32
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,425
You either love him or hate him, really.

33
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,386
Faye Cohen knows someone who knows him,

34
00:02:56,553 --> 00:03:01,432
but she says, he had a serious depression
when his wife left him.

35
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,726
The story is,
she ran off with his best friend.

36
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,103
Really?

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,729
'Cause, actually,
what I heard through the rumor mill

38
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,439
was he had a breakdown
when his best friend was killed.

39
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,067
He was a TV crew guy in Iraq
and he got beheaded.

40
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,944
Isn't that gruesome if it's true?

41
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,030
Jesus, I haven't even met the guy yet,
and I'm already jealous.

42
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,033
Jealous?
I love that you're jealous.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,618
That makes me feel desired.

44
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,121
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
Everybody on campus desires you.

45
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,582
- Oh, come on.
- But I have you.

46
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,847
I don't know, suddenly the thought of you

47
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,712
coming under the spell
of some charismatic professor...

48
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,549
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
I'm under your spell.

49
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,927
Good. Let's keep it that way.

50
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,137
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

51
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,071
Excuse me.

52
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,908
Uh, do you know where Jessup Hall is?

53
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,827
Yes, Jessup Hall is that building
over there, the red one.

54
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,288
Uh-huh, all right.
Thank you.

55
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,791
Doctor Reed?

56
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,835
- Oh.
- Professor Lucas.

57
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,505
- Professor Lucas, welcome to Braylin.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,508
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

59
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,597
- I'm sure you've had a long trip.
- Mmm-hmm. It was, yeah.

60
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,183
- Well, um...
- Thank you.

61
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,518
We've just concluded our spring semester,

62
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,688
and summer's always very active at Braylin.

63
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,815
Uh-huh.

64
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,945
We're all very happy to have you here
in the philosophy department.

65
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,821
Mmm, thank you.

66
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,367
This is it.

67
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,953
Now, the faculty housing
is pretty much spread out,

68
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,759
but, you know, everything you can get to.

69
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,040
It's within walking distance of the campus.

70
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,875
And you're really gonna like Newport.

71
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,962
It's beautiful here, but it gets
a little crowded in the summer.

72
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,380
That can be a drag.

73
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,050
It's a small house,
but it's really comfortable.

74
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:03,554
Um, right over here is the living room,
and there's a little kitchen that way.

75
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,928
And there's a little dining room
right next to that.

76
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,183
Upstairs...

77
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,060
This way.

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,479
Bathroom to the right.

79
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:16,067
And this is the bedroom.
It's small, but really comfortable.

80
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,403
And there's an office over there.

81
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,364
I think you'll really love
the philosophy department, you know?

82
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:24,242
It's in this old,
beautiful part of the campus.

83
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,994
And there's a more modern wing,

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,038
that's got state-of-the-art
stuff for science,

85
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,040
and computer technology,
if you're into that.

86
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,919
Oh, and if you want to go away,
we're just 45 minutes from Providence.

87
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,286
Thank you.
Do you want a drink?

88
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,589
Oh, no! God, no.

89
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,011
There's a little cocktail reception
to welcome you at 6:00.

90
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,851
You know, I have to tell you,
I loved your essay on situational ethics.

91
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,437
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

92
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,941
It caused a little, uh, static
with the philosophy department at Adair.

93
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,444
- This is my husband, Paul.
- Hey, how you doin'?

94
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,330
- This is Abe Lucas, philosophy department.
- Good to meet you.

95
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,906
- Yeah.
- How you doin' on that?

96
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,233
I'd like another one, please.

97
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,452
- What is it?
- Vodka martini, extra olives.

98
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,121
- Anything for you?
- Sure, I'll have another.

99
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,748
- Uh, scotch?
- Mmm-hmm.

100
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,082
- Okay.
- Thank you.

101
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,794
I'm Rita Richards.
It's so good to have you here.

102
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,922
Hey, if you're ever bored
and you want someone to give you

103
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,092
the real lowdown of
who's fucking who at this college,

104
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,969
just let me know.

105
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:31,434
So, Kant would argue
that in a truly moral world,

106
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,645
there is absolutely no room for lying.

107
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,107
And even the smallest lie

108
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,611
destroys his precious
categorical imperative.

109
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:46,074
So, Kant would say,
if a killer came to your house,

110
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,244
looking to kill the man hiding upstairs
and asked where he was,

111
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,663
you'd be obliged to tell him.

112
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,251
In his perfect world,
you know, you couldn't lie.

113
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,837
Yeah, I can see the logic

114
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,174
that if you open the door,
even just a crack,

115
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,968
you accept a world where
lying is permitted.

116
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,470
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,182
Okay, then, then you'd say
if the Nazis came to your house,

118
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,351
hiding Anne Frank and her family,

119
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,686
and asked if anyone
was in the attic, you'd say,

120
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,189
<i>"Ja,</i> the Franks are upstairs."

121
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,816
I doubt it.

122
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,277
Because there's a difference between

123
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,531
a theoretical world of philosophy bullshit,

124
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,535
and real life, you know?

125
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,663
Real, nasty, ugly life

126
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,792
that includes greed,
and hate, and genocide.

127
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,547
Remember,
if you learn nothing else from me,

128
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,884
you should learn that much of philosophy
is verbal masturbation.

129
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,388
- Have you talked to him at all?
- Mmm.

130
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,641
You know, I asked him
if he wanted to eat with us.

131
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,144
- I like the guy, but he's in a world...
- He likes to eat alone.

132
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,687
Yeah, he's in a world all his own.

133
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,063
I think he likes to keep to himself a bit.

134
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,356
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

135
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,066
Yeah, so, let him be. Right?

136
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,360
- Could take some time.
- Right.

137
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,863
Okay, Kierkegaard.

138
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,239
Um...

139
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,242
You know, when making everyday decisions,

140
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,078
we have absolute freedom of choice.

141
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,874
All right?
You can do nothing, or anything.

142
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:23,087
And this feeling of freedom
creates a sense of dread.

143
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,506
A dizzy feeling.

144
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,093
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

145
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,095
The students love you,

146
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:35,266
but, of course, you've raised
some eyebrows with the faculty.

147
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,187
- Do you ever get discouraged teaching?
- No.

148
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,272
You don't ever ask yourself
what the hell is it all about?

149
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,440
Mmm-mmm.

150
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,027
Another school, another batch of kids.

151
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,196
Sweet kids.

152
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,448
Mmm. Average kids.

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,034
Nice, but mostly mediocre.

154
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,454
They'll grow up to be those people
who shape the world with their ignorance

155
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,040
or misinformation, or passivity.

156
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,794
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

157
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,755
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

158
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,549
You want to come in?
This is where I live.

159
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,220
Paul's in Aspen at a symposium.
I've got great grass.

160
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,890
- Some other time.
- Are you sure?

161
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,309
Yeah.

162
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,062
Thanks. Thanks anyway.
I'll see you.

163
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,152
Tomorrow we're gonna discuss
phenomenology and Husserl.

164
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,279
So, be sure you do the reading, you know?

165
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,281
It can get a little complicated.

166
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,491
All right?

167
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,422
Hi, you wanted to see me?

168
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,008
Yes, your paper was quite good.

169
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,178
- Really?
- Yes.

170
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,514
I read so many papers and,

171
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,016
usually the students are merely
paraphrasing what they've read,

172
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,520
but I found your thinking
fresh and well-presented.

173
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,440
Oh, thank you.
I'm flattered.

174
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,530
I have to say, I was very influenced by
your ideas on randomness and chance.

175
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,325
Well, the truth is,
what I found most exciting

176
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,661
was when you took issue with my ideas.

177
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,705
When you disagreed with me,

178
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,542
your arguments were
well-reasoned and original.

179
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,713
Am I blushing right now?

180
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,216
That's a really big compliment.
Thank you.

181
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:37,513
Um, I did actually find
some parts of your book

182
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,724
a little hard to follow though,

183
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,061
and I would love if you
could explain some things to me.

184
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,524
Sure, can we get out of here,
though, before I die of suffocation?

185
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,987
I found your view of existence
too bleak for me.

186
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:57,199
It was like there were
no redeeming joys or pleasures.

187
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,409
Okay.

188
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:02,371
Why are you taking philosophy?
What do you want out of it?

189
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,040
Because if your goal is
to try and figure out

190
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,168
what all this bullshit's about, forget it.

191
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,838
You write books, you write papers.
You've done so much.

192
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,884
Well, let me tell you, when I look back
at all that verbal posturing,

193
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,470
my group thought we were
going to be so special.

194
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,931
I marched in every bullshit
political demonstration.

195
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,601
I spent six months in Darfur
getting food to starving families,

196
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,311
I wind up with meningitis.

197
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,563
- Mmm.
- I was in Bangladesh.

198
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,250
Yeah, you know, you want to see
a difference, to save the world.

199
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,861
But when you see
what you're up against...

200
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:37,323
Do you like vintage single malt?
You drink?

201
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,076
You mean here?

202
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,287
- Yeah.
- Right now?

203
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,915
No, no, I couldn't.

204
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,753
<i>There was no way I could have
realized from that first conversation</i>

205
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,506
<i>that a lot was very wrong with Abe.</i>

206
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:58,094
<i>He was so damn fascinating and vulnerable,
and I must say, I found him attractive.</i>

207
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,429
<i>I guess it helped that
he felt comfortable with me.</i>

208
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,139
I drove a cab.

209
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,101
I was a handyman in a building.

210
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,895
I ran an elevator.
But I always read.

211
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,357
Always, always loved the Russian writers.

212
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,776
Especially Dostoyevsky.
Dostoyevsky got it.

213
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,946
I've read all of it.

214
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,948
- Really?
- Mmm.

215
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,243
Oh, I had a great conversation
with Abe Lucas the other day.

216
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,452
Uh-huh.

217
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,746
He said my paper was
well-organized and original.

218
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,956
- All right.
- Right?

219
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,416
Yeah, I can see where this is goin'.

220
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,543
Oh, stop it, please.

221
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,712
He's just fascinating because he's brilliant,
but he's a sufferer.

222
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,006
Perfect. Great, you always
became attracted to the sufferers.

223
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,675
Right? That's how we first met.

224
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,718
He's a real sufferer, Roy.
You had shingles.

225
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,306
He was traumatized
when his best friend was killed in Iraq.

226
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,102
- He was a journalist, just horrifying.
- Didn't he get his head cut off?

227
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,729
His head cut off?
No, no, it was an explosion.

228
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,939
Oh.

229
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,693
God, it's amazing how people
embellish these stories.

230
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,571
You know, Abe actually says
that people just manufacture drama

231
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,449
so they can get through their lives
because they're so empty.

232
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,410
Can we just change the subject
of Abe Lucas, please?

233
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,996
You've been, like, singing
his praises for half an hour.

234
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,039
All right, well, then,
how about I sing yours?

235
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,750
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. Good.
- How's that?

236
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,252
I love you in that sweater.

237
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,588
Of course, you love me in this sweater.
You bought it for me.

238
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,716
Well, you look great in that shade of blue.

239
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,509
You really do.

240
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,429
You know Abe's mother committed suicide?

241
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,680
Abe again?

242
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,183
I mean, can you imagine?
He was 12.

243
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,019
She drank bleach!
It's so sad.

244
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,356
You know, Simone de Beauvoir pointed out,
and quite correctly,

245
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,775
that in a society shaped by men,

246
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,112
women are seen as relative beings
existing only in relationship to men.

247
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,406
- Hmm.
- You agree with that?

248
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,701
- I agree with that completely.
- Mmm-hmm.

249
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,787
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about you.

250
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,124
That you've had a lot of
experience with women.

251
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,210
You mean slept with.

252
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,004
You find that fulfilling?

253
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,590
Many women and one-night stands?

254
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,051
I did at the time.

255
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,095
It had a certain frantic quality.

256
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,140
One day, it stopped being exciting.

257
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,518
I couldn't find distraction anymore

258
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,938
in that usually reliable painkiller,
the orgasm.

259
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,023
Why not?

260
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,610
I couldn't remember the reason for living.

261
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,155
And when I did,
it wasn't convincing.

262
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,366
That sounds scary.

263
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,662
It's very scary when
you run out of distractions.

264
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,248
Well, what if it wasn't a distraction?

265
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,252
What if you just decided
to commit yourself to one person?

266
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,714
If I met someone now,
I'm too far gone to appreciate her.

267
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,262
I have to go to my piano lesson.

268
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,057
What are you doing on Friday night?

269
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,478
Oh, I don't know.
Why?

270
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,147
I think you should come to a party.

271
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,816
- Uh...
- I do.

272
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,652
Roy and I will take you.
We can go and it'll...

273
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,571
There'll be music and it'll be fun.

274
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,114
There's a lot of students that like you.

275
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,491
There really are.

276
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,898
And I think it's better than
just wallowing in your room.

277
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,371
I don't think that's healthy.

278
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,416
You should think about it.
You want to come out?

279
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,649
- Yes?
- Hi.

280
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,321
I'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but,

281
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:49,450
I was shopping today at
the liquor store, and,

282
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,621
I came across these two very fine bottles
of single malt scotch,

283
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,247
and I got one for Paul and myself.

284
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,125
And I know how much
you love single malt scotch.

285
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,212
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.
How much do I owe you?

286
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,382
Oh, God, no, I bought it for you.

287
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,551
Oh, thank you.

288
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,306
You could have waited to give it to me.
You didn't have to come in the rain.

289
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,225
I couldn't wait.
I was excited over it.

290
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,854
Will you have one with me?

291
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,148
I thought you'd never ask.

292
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,944
Um... Hmm.

293
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,781
What have you been doing?

294
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:33,243
I'm trying to finish this book
I started a long time ago.

295
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,580
- What's it about?
- About Heidegger and fascism.

296
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,458
Just what the world needs.

297
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:44,129
Another book about Heidegger and fascism.

298
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,091
How's it coming?

299
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:51,637
I'm blocked.
I can't write.

300
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,056
Why?

301
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,101
Oh, I...

302
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:02,815
I can't write 'cause I can't breathe.

303
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,155
What would get you breathing again?

304
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,119
I, you know...
The will to breathe.

305
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,830
- Hmm.
- Inspiration, you know?

306
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,332
You need a muse.

307
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,086
I have never needed a muse before.

308
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,635
I hope you're not gonna send me
back out into the rain

309
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,929
without sleeping with me.

310
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,724
I'm trying to write.

311
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,726
You're blocked.

312
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,270
I'm going to unblock you.

313
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:47,234
Or are you becoming infatuated with
that student you spend so much time with?

314
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,369
When the hurricane hit in New Orleans,

315
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,330
Abe went down there
and stayed for six weeks.

316
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,417
He said the problems
were completely overwhelming.

317
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,670
And the political red tape
and corruption was just a scandal.

318
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,923
He couldn't believe the amount
of stupidity and greed.

319
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,884
It was a scandal for George Bush.

320
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,635
Well, Abe was right there
in the thick of it,

321
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,763
trying to get something accomplished.

322
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,099
And meanwhile, his wife was
falling in love with his best friend.

323
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,101
Uh-huh.
- Can you believe that?

324
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,604
Abe really, really loved his wife.

325
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,565
They met on a trip to Machu Picchu
to see the ruins.

326
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,650
They both experimented with mescaline.

327
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,154
He's actually tried every drug.
He hates them.

328
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,032
He's very conservative
in a kind of liberal way.

329
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,327
- It seems like he really opened up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

330
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,746
Everyone says
he's not easy to get to know.

331
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,473
Well, I definitely have not found that.

332
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,250
Hey, can we just get off
the topic of Abe Lucas?

333
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,169
I mean, I must say,
I'm not thrilled

334
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,504
that you invited him out
with us tomorrow night

335
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,713
without asking me first.

336
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,590
Well, he needs some human contact, Roy.

337
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,597
Otherwise, he just sits
in his room and broods.

338
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,094
Yeah, but you can see
why I might be jealous, no?

339
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,347
That's silly.

340
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,557
Famous last words.

341
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,603
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,608
I know it must have been a disappointment,
to say the least.

343
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,986
Have you tried any of the impotence drugs?

344
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,863
It's not physical.

345
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,990
And don't take it personally.

346
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,411
I haven't been able to perform
in nearly a year.

347
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,414
Have you seen a shrink?

348
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,043
'Cause I know a good one for that problem.

349
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:33,298
I keep hoping it'll come back
as mysteriously as it left.

350
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,342
I'm sorry I let you down.

351
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,428
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sure it's hell for you.

352
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,266
Thanks for the scotch.

353
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,736
What are you doing over here?

354
00:19:54,903 --> 00:20:00,158
Are you having one of your morbid insights
on the transient futility of human joy?

355
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,202
Is my face that grim?

356
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,497
I have never seen a de Kooning
in a private house.

357
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,984
- I know, so my parents got it at auction.
- It's gorgeous.

358
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,002
They're just starting to collect.
They're buying so much.

359
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,588
They got a Kitaj and a Warhol
at Sotheby's, like, last week.

360
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,797
No way!

361
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,048
I know, I know.

362
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,217
April, honestly,
are you afraid of getting robbed?

363
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,387
No, I mean the house
has alarms, like, all over.

364
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,389
- Show them what your father keeps.
- No.

365
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,756
- Come on, show them...
- I'm not gonna show it to them.

366
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,437
Oh, my God. You do this, like,
every time you come over here.

367
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,688
It's so weird.

368
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,175
We get it, the painting is fine,
the painting is all right.

369
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,111
For the burglars.

370
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,654
Yes, there it is!

371
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,239
- Come on, give me it, give!
- Oh, my God.

372
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,926
- Is it loaded?
- This is my baby.

373
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,619
My baby? Oh, my God.

374
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,080
No, it's not loaded. It's totally...
I'm taking the bullets out.

375
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
Do you shoot this?

376
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,584
No, my dad takes it out
into the woods sometimes.

377
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,879
Where they play Russian Roulette.

378
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,964
What's Russian Roulette?

379
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,843
What's Russian Roulette?

380
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,053
- Just explain it.
- All right, fine.

381
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,554
Okay, so, you take a bullet.

382
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,399
Take a bullet
and you put it in the chamber.

383
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,434
- Don't demonstrate it...
- Well, I'm not gonna do it!

384
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,281
So, you... Then you spin it around, right?

385
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,854
And, um, you hold it up to your head.

386
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,189
- You squeeze the trigger.
- Okay...

387
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,317
And you have five, no, you have
five to one odds that nothing will happen.

388
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,277
But if you're unlucky...

389
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,862
- You're just kind of...
- Very unlucky.

390
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,113
Why?

391
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,616
And why do they do this,
just for money, or what?

392
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,952
No, it's like, it's, the stakes are
so much higher than money.

393
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,621
- It's not about money.
- For what? For what end?

394
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,998
You know, you get like a real high
when you pull the trigger and...

395
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,584
Danny, stop! Put that away.

396
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,173
Here, let me see this.

397
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,716
I don't like guns.

398
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,218
Just be careful.

399
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,054
Abe, put the gun down!

400
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,622
Oh, my God!

401
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,393
What the hell are you doing, Abe?

402
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:50,936
The odds were in my favor.

403
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,854
Do you think that's funny?

404
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,064
- But, I mean...
- Abe, put the gun down.

405
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,271
- Was it worth the risk?
- Well, not at five to one.

406
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,193
Here, fifty-fifty odds.

407
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,820
Abe!

408
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,656
Stop it, stop it!

409
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:03,991
Stop!

410
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,201
You want to kill yourself,
go to the chem lab, swallow cyanide.

411
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,452
Don't do it in front of us.

412
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,706
This is an existential lesson
better than in the textbooks.

413
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,957
You're drunk.

414
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,644
You're completely drunk.
Let's go home.

415
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,002
Come on, you drink too much.

416
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,839
Fifty-fifty odds is better
than most people get in life.

417
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,844
Word around is your philosophy professor's
got a bit of an alcohol problem.

418
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,431
Oh, boy, that's just one of his problems.

419
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:31,518
And, you know, it's really a shame,
because he's so self-destructive,

420
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,603
but he's so brilliant.

421
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,772
But can I tell you what I think?

422
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,442
And we're just the music department.

423
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,028
Yes.

424
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,697
He writes very well, very...

425
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:45,949
Lively.

426
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,452
But it's a triumph of style.

427
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,997
The substance just doesn't
stand up to scrutiny.

428
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:56,209
His ideas are romantic, but so flawed.

429
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,424
I just hope you're not starting to care
for him too much, in the wrong way.

430
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,385
Oh, God, no.
I love Roy.

431
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:11,058
Although it is interesting to be around
someone so complicated.

432
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,769
I fear for him, I do.
I, you know...

433
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,605
Romantics think suicide is romantic.

434
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,413
<i>The truth was I was attracted to Abe.</i>

435
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,740
<i>Despite, or was it because,
he was a lost soul.</i>

436
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,577
<i>There was something
about his pain and sensitivity</i>

437
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,246
<i>that tapped into my romantic fantasies.</i>

438
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:37,334
<i>It was exciting going to museums
and seeing movies with him.</i>

439
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,753
<i>He was truly an original thinker.</i>

440
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,090
<i>The problem was he had no zest for life,</i>

441
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,552
<i>no joy, no clear reason for living,
he said, which alarmed me.</i>

442
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,139
<i>I wanted so much to help him.</i>

443
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,599
I've given up.

444
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,809
It's all bullshit.

445
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,603
You know, my bullshit book
on Martin Heidegger

446
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,314
is not gonna make
a scintilla of difference to the world.

447
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,608
Why do you say things like that?
How do you know that?

448
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,527
I set out to be an active world changer

449
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,114
and wound up a passive intellectual
who can't fuck.

450
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:13,537
Well, Abe, maybe Rita Richards
couldn't get your creative juices flowing,

451
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,289
but did you think that maybe I could?

452
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,916
Uh-uh, Jill.

453
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,085
Don't.

454
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,629
Don't what?

455
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,631
Don't do this.

456
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,680
Well, we spend a lot of time together, Abe.

457
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,348
- You know, and I...
- We're friends.

458
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,058
I know it's...

459
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,813
All right, well, I thought you could tell
that I cared about you.

460
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,858
I mean, it's pretty obvious to everyone.

461
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,986
Including your boyfriend?

462
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,948
I don't... I'm not ready to make
an exclusive commitment to him.

463
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,366
He's...

464
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,162
- I just have a lot of questions and...
- All right, Jill.

465
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,914
Maybe we're spending
too much time together.

466
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,876
Maybe I shouldn't monopolize your time.

467
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,924
Okay.

468
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,053
Why are you in such a bad mood?

469
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,264
Roy, I'm fine.
All right?

470
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,631
Can't I just be a little bit edgy
every once in a while?

471
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,519
Well, have you thought
any more about what I said?

472
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:20,854
What?

473
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,815
That after graduation, we go to London,
we move in together

474
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,817
and we do our postgrad work at Oxford, no?

475
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,945
It's a very
big idea and I don't know.

476
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,947
I think it would be a great experience.

477
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,657
Jill, stop, stop.

478
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,827
Come on, you know I love you.
What's wrong?

479
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,914
I just can't talk about
this right now, Roy.

480
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,790
I feel very achy.

481
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,376
Like maybe I'm coming down
with something, or...

482
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,921
- Okay...
- I don't know, like a flu or...

483
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,923
All right.

484
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,510
Isn't it a lovely spot?

485
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,638
I love it.

486
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,391
I come here when I want to be alone.

487
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,313
You're looking a little glum.

488
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,733
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

489
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,321
I thought maybe some time had passed,
you know?

490
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,698
And you took the Cialis?

491
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,450
Against my better judgment.

492
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,370
Can I confess something?

493
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:24,000
When I heard you were coming here,
I'd walk along these rocks,

494
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,297
and had fantasies that we'd meet
and something special would happen.

495
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,717
If you're unhappy,
why can't you just up and leave?

496
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,803
I...

497
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,014
I can't do it alone.

498
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,850
You know, I just can't.

499
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,353
I need somebody to leave with.

500
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,440
<i>Jill had been right
in her appraisal of me.</i>

501
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,818
<i>I was teetering on the brink
of some kind of breakdown,</i>

502
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:54,114
<i>unable to deal with my feelings
of anger, frustration, futility.</i>

503
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,202
<i>They say that drowning
is a painless way to go.</i>

504
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,791
Despair is what Kierkegaard called
the sickness unto death, Abe.

505
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,253
And you suffer from despair.

506
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,007
I'm well aware of what Kierkegaard thought.

507
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,594
But he was, in the end, a Christian.
How comforting that would be.

508
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,016
So, are you looking forward
to your piano recital tonight?

509
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,267
Did you settle on the Bach?

510
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,727
- We'll figure this out.
- I don't know.

511
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:24,936
This is wrong.

512
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,689
Are you aware of
what's going on at this table?

513
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:28,898
What?

514
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,610
It is a messed-up situation.

515
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,697
And my kids
feel like I'm not comin' back.

516
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:35,864
Aw, that's not true.

517
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,908
I know.
I don't know what to do.

518
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,410
I'm at my wit's end.

519
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,245
Who's the judge?

520
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,247
Uh, Spangler. Thomas Spangler.

521
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,875
How'd this guy ever wind up
in family court? It's just...

522
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,251
They're political appointees.

523
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,218
Some are okay, but a lot of 'em are
just bums who are getting paid off.

524
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,630
It's not right.

525
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,925
He awards the kids to Frank.
Frank doesn't even look after them.

526
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,719
- It's true...
- Frank doesn't even want them.

527
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,347
He doesn't care about his own kids.

528
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,682
I deliver them to him,
they don't want to go.

529
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,893
They're crying.
They're crying.

530
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,354
What does Frank do?

531
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,357
He sticks 'em in a corner
of the garage he works at.

532
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,817
And they sit underground all day.

533
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,528
I mean, they should be outside,
in the fresh air.

534
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,991
And now he's gonna
switch custody to Frank?

535
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,577
- On what grounds?
- On no grounds.

536
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,498
Because he's friendly in some way
with Frank's lawyer.

537
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,625
Switching custody
would be a disaster.

538
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,126
It doesn't make sense.

539
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:33,046
I brought in the kids' teachers,
I brought in the kids' doctors.

540
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,464
It doesn't matter.

541
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,217
And you're sure he can't be recused?

542
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:40,387
We tried.
My lawyer tried and failed.

543
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,725
I can't keep payin' all these legal bills
and the judge knows it.

544
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,173
So, every time I want something,
he says, "Make a motion."

545
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,605
And we do, but he turns me down.

546
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,566
And it's costin' me everything I got.

547
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,860
- And I'm gonna lose my kids.
- Aw.

548
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,071
And you're sure he's cozy
with Frank's lawyer?

549
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,699
Oh, God,
they look at each other, they smile.

550
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:05,161
I got a bad break,
drawin' this judge.

551
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,455
It's just so unfair.

552
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,125
I'm due in court in six weeks.

553
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,876
If he doesn't postpone it again,

554
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,213
which he does,
because he knows it helps Frank.

555
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,717
I can't get a decent night's sleep.

556
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,805
I wish I could take the kids
and move to Europe.

557
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,372
I mean, I actually thought of
taking them out of the country.

558
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,185
What, and hide for the rest of your life?

559
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,062
You'd be a fugitive.

560
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:35,233
I feel for you, Carol, I do.
And you're such a good mother.

561
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,487
I hope the judge gets cancer.

562
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,241
<i>He won't get cancer.</i>

563
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,702
<i>Because wishing doesn't work.</i>

564
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,914
<i>If you want him dead,
you have to make it happen.</i>

565
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,916
<i>But you'd never be able to pull it off,</i>

566
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,253
<i>and even if you did,
you'd be a prime suspect.</i>

567
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,756
<i>On the other hand,
I could kill him for you, lady,</i>

568
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,718
<i>and no one in the world
would dream I did it.</i>

569
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:05,597
<i>I could rid you of this roach
and end all your suffering.</i>

570
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,101
<i>It was at this moment
that my life came together.</i>

571
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,062
<i>I could perform this blessing
for that poor woman</i>

572
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,982
<i>and no one would ever connect me to it.</i>

573
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,485
<i>I don't know any of the parties involved,</i>

574
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,737
<i>I have no motive,
and when I walk out of here,</i>

575
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,072
<i>I'll never lay eyes on
any of these people again.</i>

576
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,575
<i>All I need to know is the name.</i>

577
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,244
<i>Judge Thomas Spangler.</i>

578
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,297
Are you okay?

579
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:43,092
Wow, God.
I got a little dizzy in there.

580
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,428
What, you're shaking.

581
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,138
- I guess, um...
- Are you all right?

582
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,545
An anxiety attack or something.

583
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,808
- I have medicine at home.
- Okay.

584
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,145
Yeah, I don't know why I feel so dizzy.

585
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,283
<i>Everything about killing
Judge Spangler turned me on.</i>

586
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,495
<i>The idea of helping this woman,
of taking action,</i>

587
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,342
<i>of ridding the world of the kind of vermin</i>

588
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,124
<i>that makes the world
an extra hell for all of us.</i>

589
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,795
<i>I was intrigued by the creative challenge
of bringing off a perfect murder.</i>

590
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,508
<i>It was a high-stakes risk,
but the risk made me feel alive.</i>

591
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:40,149
- Sorry. Hey, you were great.
- Oh, thank you.

592
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,402
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

593
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,154
I've been thinking about that woman
that we overheard all day. Have you?

594
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,366
- Yeah, me, too, yeah.
- It's amazing what happens to some people.

595
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,660
God, I don't blame her
for wishing him dead.

596
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,704
I'd be rooting for him
to have a heart attack,

597
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,247
as awful as that sounds.

598
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,584
No. I mean, don't you think
that there are some people that die

599
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,835
and with their death,

600
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,380
the world becomes
a slightly better place instantly?

601
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:05,008
Mmm, I don't think it's
quite as simple as that.

602
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:09,053
I mean, he could be a terrible judge,
but a decent loving father.

603
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,723
- First off, he's not a father.
- How do you know?

604
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,892
I was so fascinated, I couldn't help
but check him out on my computer.

605
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,936
My God, you remembered his name?

606
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,188
Even if he was a good family man,

607
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,859
that's like those, you know,
Mafia bosses who do horrible things,

608
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,746
and, what, we're supposed to cut them slack

609
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,697
because they're wonderful
to their wives and children?

610
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:31,909
You have to resist the temptation
to overthink a very clear-cut issue.

611
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:35,955
You know, he's a rotten judge,
not impartial as he's vowed to be,

612
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,083
crushing a woman and her kids
simply because he has the power to do it.

613
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,044
No one can stop him.

614
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,462
I mean...

615
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,548
It's not that ambiguous,
even though it's ugly to say it.

616
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:48,593
He's a roach who'd be better stamped out.

617
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,265
<i>The dizziness and anxiety
had disappeared,</i>

618
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,895
<i>and I accepted completely, in fact,
embraced my freedom to choose action.</i>

619
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,813
<i>I was too excited to fall asleep.</i>

620
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,734
<i>My mind was racing with ideas,
plans to kill Judge Spangler.</i>

621
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,182
<i>Thanks to a serendipitous encounter
with an unknown woman,</i>

622
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,656
<i>my life suddenly had a purpose.</i>

623
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,826
<i>When I finally did fall asleep,
I slept the sleep of the just.</i>

624
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,095
- Morning.
- Morning.

625
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,429
Oh, I know what I want.

626
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:37,934
I want the orange juice, French toast,
hash browns and double bacon.

627
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,520
Hey, what happened to
the usual black coffee?

628
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,188
Can I help it if I'm famished?

629
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,108
Well, bravo.
You want cinnamon on the French toast?

630
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,276
- Yes, I want cinnamon.
- Okay.

631
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,028
- Hi.
- Hi!

632
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,488
Good morning.

633
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,616
Whoa, you're full of energy this morning.

634
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,118
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

635
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,084
- I made a big decision last night.
- You did?

636
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,288
Mmm-hmm.
To take control of my own life.

637
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,165
Well, that's good.

638
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:05,795
What prompted this reawakening?
Did you have a religious epiphany?

639
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,214
I just decided it's time to stop whining

640
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:11,384
and to take matters into my own hands
and make something happen.

641
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,553
Well, that's good,
because, uh, to be honest,

642
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,221
some of us here were
kind of worried about you.

643
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:17,140
- Huh.
- You seemed at such a low point.

644
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,183
The trick is not to
examine things too closely.

645
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,228
Not to debate every issue,
but to go with your gut feeling.

646
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,731
You know, and choosing action, to do,

647
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,817
rather than to observe
and get lost in conventional clichés.

648
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,654
I think I follow. Philosophy is
not a strong suit, you know, so...

649
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,989
Yeah, I think I know
what your strong suit is...

650
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,074
I'm a little slow.
Oh, really?

651
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,841
I knew you'd love that lighthouse.

652
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,768
It's one of my favorite
places in the world.

653
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,511
Oh, it's so beautiful here.

654
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,431
I can't help thinking of
that phrase by Emily Dickinson,

655
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,016
"Inebriate of air."

656
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,685
To be drunk on air.

657
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,730
Not to have to rely on single malt scotch.

658
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,860
You know, you once said that
you used to fool around with poetry.

659
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:15,406
Mmm. Yeah, I destroyed
all my poems in a fit of rage,

660
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:19,869
when my funny, sweet friend,
this guy I grew up with my whole life,

661
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,706
stepped on a fucking land mine in Iraq.

662
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,291
Oh, Jesus.

663
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,295
But you know, maybe if you like,
I could try writing again for you.

664
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,047
I mean, I'm not very good,

665
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:34,550
but you know,
I might enjoy trying again for you.

666
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,265
You know I'm in love with you.

667
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,560
You think you are.

668
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,729
What you are is in love
with the romantic concept

669
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:49,899
of being in love with
your college professor.

670
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:54,070
The correct road for you is
with that terrific guy you're going with.

671
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,114
Is that really what you think?

672
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,493
I'll always be your friend.

673
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,120
And even your poet laureate.

674
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,092
That was fantastic.

675
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,760
My God, what have you
been eating for breakfast?

676
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,931
Aw. I don't deserve all the credit.
You are hot stuff, lady.

677
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,684
What happened to the philosophy professor?

678
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,270
Christ, you were like a caveman.

679
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,439
For the first time in so long, I felt free.

680
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,776
You know?
Just a limitless freedom.

681
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,280
Run away with me.

682
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,282
Where? To Tahiti?

683
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,285
Like Gauguin?
To make love in the tropics?

684
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,829
I want to leave Paul and move to Spain.

685
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,455
- Yes?
- Yeah.

686
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,124
Why Spain?

687
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,877
I always found Spain to be so romantic.

688
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,169
Hmm.

689
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,966
- Now, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yes?

690
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,469
Yeah, have you been sleeping
with that student Jill Pollard?

691
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:04,307
I've been sleeping with no one
for a year, till tonight.

692
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,351
Not that I haven't tried,
as you sadly know.

693
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,146
- You tried with the student?
- No, never.

694
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,814
We're only friends.

695
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,482
Well, because there's
talk around the school.

696
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,318
Mmm, it's just talk.

697
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,487
People fill their lonely hours with gossip.

698
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,157
Now put it out of your mind.

699
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,827
<i>My zest for life had returned</i>

700
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,497
<i>and the driving force of this rebirth
was my rock-solid determination</i>

701
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,541
<i>to perform a service for a mother of two</i>

702
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,253
<i>and rid the world of
Judge Thomas Augustus Spangler.</i>

703
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,216
<i>He lived alone on a pretty street
within walking distance to the courthouse.</i>

704
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,680
<i>One day a week, he played bridge
with his cronies at the Pavilion Club.</i>

705
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,767
<i>He was a member and ate there pretty often.</i>

706
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,356
<i>Saturday mornings,
he jogged at Lippitt Park.</i>

707
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,275
<i>He was not well-thought of as a judge
and had been censured once or twice,</i>

708
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,945
<i>but had never been reversed
on appeal because he was smart</i>

709
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,197
<i>and also one of the boys.</i>

710
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,785
Why continental philosophy?

711
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,372
Because, you know,
continental philosophy deals with

712
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:14,251
problems much more exciting and,
and personal than the analytic tradition.

713
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,212
You know, the existentialists
were tryin' to find out

714
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:20,549
not just what does something mean,
but what does it mean for me?

715
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:30,059
I never thought I would get you
to go to an amusement park.

716
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,103
Where's Roy tonight?

717
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,604
Studying.

718
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,941
Well, I'm mellowing in my old age.

719
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:40,319
And now that we're here,
I'm determined to win you a prize.

720
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:45,741
<i>There was no question
there was something lighter about Abe.</i>

721
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:46,909
<i>His spirits seemed up,</i>

722
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:50,746
<i>he seemed more focused,
more optimistic, more charming.</i>

723
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,499
<i>He said he was determined
to win me a prize.</i>

724
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:58,087
<i>And after one of his standard lectures
on the impact of luck and random chance,</i>

725
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:01,257
<i>he managed to pick the winning number
on his first spin.</i>

726
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,094
I want to go with my first instinct.
There's my first hunch, 17.

727
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,763
Okey-dokey, here we go!

728
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,558
Round, and round, and round it goes.

729
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:14,645
And where will it stop?
Nobody knows.

730
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,731
And...

731
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,484
Wow!

732
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:21,856
Unbelievable.

733
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,071
- I won.
- You're a lucky man.

734
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,781
- How did you do that?
- Luck rules the universe.

735
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,283
Oh, you think so?

736
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,495
Correction, not luck, chance.
We're all at the mercy of chance.

737
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,497
All right, what, what do you want?
What prize do you want?

738
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,499
- Um, okay...
- Anything, anything you want!

739
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,461
Oh, uh, the flashlight, please.

740
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,296
- Flashlight?
- Yeah.

741
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,465
- A nice practical choice.
- Thank you.

742
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,176
- This isn't practical.
- That's not practical?

743
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,136
- No, it's cool...
- I mean, look at your other options.

744
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,471
You're saying that you picked a flashlight?

745
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,972
- I like the color...
- Come on.

746
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,600
I hate that you think I'm practical.

747
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,147
Whoa!

748
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,321
- Oh, God.
- I feel like I'm on mescaline again.

749
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,368
God, but, look.

750
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,705
Even in the distorting mirror,
you look good.

751
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:18,876
I hope you don't think
I'm some middle-class drone.

752
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:22,004
I might surprise you.

753
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,339
Yeah?

754
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:29,553
Hey.

755
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,390
No, it's a bad idea.
It's a bad idea.

756
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,677
What do you mean?
I think it's a little late for that.

757
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,229
You have a terrific boyfriend

758
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:41,398
and he's obviously crazy
about you and don't...

759
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,818
I know.
And I love Roy.

760
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:47,530
But it doesn't mean I'm ready
to commit to him and give up...

761
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,365
Listen to me, listen to me.

762
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,034
You don't want to get involved
with an extremist like me.

763
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,869
- Trust me.
- Why not?

764
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,330
I can be just as risk-taking as you.

765
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,874
All right.
We got carried away.

766
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,252
All right, let's just
forget the kiss, okay?

767
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,545
What if I can't?

768
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:07,550
Then I have to be the responsible one
and keep things from getting out of hand.

769
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,596
Come on, let's have fun.

770
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,895
<i>I was sure Abe had feelings for me.</i>

771
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,565
<i>But maybe it was just that
he wasn't in love with me</i>

772
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,608
<i>the way I was with him.</i>

773
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,778
<i>I tried telling myself the reason
he wasn't letting anything go too far</i>

774
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:31,115
<i>was because a relationship
between a professor and a student</i>

775
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:32,533
<i>was against Braylin's rules,</i>

776
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,912
<i>but I knew in my heart,
Abe was too romantic to shy away from risks.</i>

777
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,917
<i>All I was sure of was
that as much as I cared for Roy,</i>

778
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,627
<i>and I really did,</i>

779
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:46,589
<i>I was swept off my feet by Abe Lucas.</i>

780
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:50,092
<i>The more he tried not to let
anything serious happen,</i>

781
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,636
<i>the more I wanted something to.</i>

782
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,311
<i>I was right in thinking
the killing would be an act of creativity.</i>

783
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,480
<i>It was artistically challenging
to plan how to do away with Spangler</i>

784
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,399
<i>and bring it off perfectly.</i>

785
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,234
<i>Weighing all the options,
I came to the conclusion</i>

786
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,081
<i>that the only practical way I could do it,</i>

787
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,447
<i>and hope to get away with it,
was to poison him.</i>

788
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:14,116
<i>Careful not to leave
any record on my computer,</i>

789
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:15,659
<i>I researched all the poisons</i>

790
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:18,454
<i>and it was clear why cyanide
had become the popular cliché</i>

791
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,456
<i>of mystery writers and spies.</i>

792
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:23,125
<i>Cyanide would be quick and painless.</i>

793
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,670
<i>And while it would be impossible
to obtain any legally,</i>

794
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:30,799
<i>I knew where I might get some
without having to fill out any forms.</i>

795
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:35,137
<i>Every stage of the way was a risk
and I must admit, exhilarating.</i>

796
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,287
Professor Lucas.

797
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:25,789
What are you doing here?

798
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,083
- Hi.
- Yeah, it's April?

799
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,460
- April, yeah.
- Yeah.

800
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,587
I'm doing research for
a book I'm working on.

801
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,255
Well, that's cool.

802
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,882
Well, I'm glad to see you're
wearing rubber gloves

803
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,384
'cause, you know, a lot of those poisons
are actually pretty dangerous.

804
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,677
Yes, I know.

805
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,721
Actually, wait.
While I have you here...

806
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:43,169
Can I ask you a question
on the paper I'm writing on Kant?

807
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,267
Sure, sure, but can we talk as we walk?

808
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:48,437
Yeah, so, it's due on Friday and basically,

809
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,981
I just don't understand
his moral principles.

810
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,984
I don't understand.
You've been in such a touchy mood.

811
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,612
I'm fine,
I just don't want to go to the concert.

812
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,946
Yeah, but the only reason I got the tickets

813
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,593
is because you said you wanted to go.

814
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,451
Well, I'm sorry, Roy.
I just had a change of heart.

815
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:03,994
- Go with a friend.
- Yeah, I will.

816
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:06,163
But I was looking forward
to going with you.

817
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,333
Well, I just...
I'm not up to it, all right?

818
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,754
I think you're losin' interest in me
because of Abe Lucas.

819
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:17,466
Oh, God, Roy.
We've had this conversation so many times.

820
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,634
He's a friend.

821
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,428
I think you'd be fine
if he was more than a friend.

822
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,473
- Can we please not discuss...
- But you know it's so obvious.

823
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,141
It's obvious.

824
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:27,935
You know what?

825
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:30,312
There's nothing going on.
So, you're paranoid.

826
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:32,106
Okay. Okay.

827
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,859
Well, I'll just go to
the concert with Mike.

828
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:38,654
Oh, you'll have fun.
Mike is sweet.

829
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:40,030
Yeah.

830
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,043
<i>It was Judge Spangler's
jogging routine</i>

831
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,993
<i>that gave me the idea I was looking for.</i>

832
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,871
<i>That is, once it became clear to me
that it was a routine.</i>

833
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,332
<i>His weekend run, his morning newspaper,</i>

834
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:54,461
<i>his park bench, his container
of fresh-squeezed orange juice.</i>

835
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,171
<i>The more I found out about him,</i>

836
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:59,508
<i>I was convinced the world
would be a better place without him.</i>

837
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:19,903
- Here, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

838
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,363
Happy birthday!

839
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,198
Oh, thank you, oh.

840
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:24,533
Blow.

841
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,577
- Yay!
- All right.

842
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,828
Okay.

843
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,416
What is this gonna be?

844
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:38,046
Roy, this is exactly the
sweater that I wanted,

845
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,840
but I mentioned it months ago.

846
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:42,009
- I thought you forgot. Thank you.
- You look so pretty in it.

847
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,552
I love it.

848
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,555
So, where are you
taking her for her birthday?

849
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,082
We are going to the Colonial
to see a new comedy over there.

850
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:50,225
You know, I should actually get my things.

851
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:51,435
Okay.

852
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:53,562
- The political satire.
- Yeah.

853
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,731
I heard that was very good.

854
00:46:55,898 --> 00:46:57,691
- We should go see that.
- Yeah, it's supposed to be great.

855
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,943
<i>My parents and Roy
gave me a birthday cake</i>

856
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,071
<i>and some presents,
and they were all very sweet.</i>

857
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,948
<i>But I must admit...</i>

858
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:08,744
<i>I was hurt there was no
acknowledgment from Abe Lucas.</i>

859
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,934
<i>I got out of the park
and no one saw me.</i>

860
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,187
<i>I never saw Spangler drink the juice.</i>

861
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:43,065
<i>And while I tried to stay focused
at our weekend faculty meeting,</i>

862
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,067
<i>my mind was a million miles away.</i>

863
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,487
<i>The body of the jogger
who died of an apparent heart attack</i>

864
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,780
<i>in Lippitt Park today</i>

865
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,366
<i>was identified as Judge Thomas Spangler,</i>

866
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:55,202
<i>a Rhode Island state
judge in domestic court.</i>

867
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,037
<i>The news took colleagues by surprise,</i>

868
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:59,164
<i>as the judge was said
to have been in good health,</i>

869
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,375
<i>and exercised regularly.</i>

870
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,418
<i>Judge Spangler was 61.</i>

871
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:07,714
<i>Next morning,
I rushed out to get the papers.</i>

872
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,591
<i>And there it was.</i>

873
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:13,261
<i>A great feeling of accomplishment
came over me.</i>

874
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:16,556
<i>I didn't write a vitriolic,
well-reasoned piece about judicial abuse</i>

875
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,363
<i>that would wind up just so much verbiage,</i>

876
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,601
<i>accomplishing nothing.</i>

877
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:22,813
<i>I took direct action and
eliminated a cancer.</i>

878
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,441
<i>The world was a finer place
by some infinitesimal percentage.</i>

879
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,318
<i>The woman would never know
she had a benefactor,</i>

880
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:30,070
<i>but now, at her court hearing,</i>

881
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:33,323
<i>there was every chance
she'd have a fair shot.</i>

882
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:39,621
Yeah, of course, I read it.
It's just the most amazing thing.

883
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:41,289
I'm stunned.

884
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,918
What? No, no.
We have nothing to feel guilty about.

885
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:47,129
I mean, he was terrible.

886
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,669
Hey, listen, what are you doin' later?
Are you free?

887
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,883
'Cause I think we should have dinner.
Just the two of us.

888
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,885
Yeah, we'll have a wicked celebration.

889
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,138
7:30? All right, perfect.

890
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,648
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

891
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,151
I love that you order for me.

892
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:13,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

893
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,831
God, I, you know, I feel great tonight.

894
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,667
Relaxed and happy.

895
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:30,005
Well, it, it's supposed
to be a celebration, right?

896
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:34,342
Although I think it is a little macabre
to suggest celebrating someone's death.

897
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,346
You know, life's ironic, isn't it?

898
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:43,643
One day a person has a morass
of complicated, unsolvable problems,

899
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:49,024
you know, the world seems black,
and her troubles seem overwhelming,

900
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,444
and then, in the batting of an eye,
the dark clouds part

901
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:53,987
and she can enjoy a decent life again.

902
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:56,281
- It's just, it's astounding.
- Hmm.

903
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,658
Sometimes, just a little thing.

904
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:01,369
Like a sudden heart attack.

905
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,998
- Or, you know, hitting the lottery.
- Right, hmm.

906
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,461
I'm actually celebrating
for the second time in three days.

907
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,296
Second time?

908
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:14,466
My birthday was the day before yesterday.

909
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,051
Mmm.

910
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,677
No, I know.

911
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,515
I knew that you knew.
I made sure that you knew.

912
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,685
I was actually a little upset that you
didn't call to wish me a happy birthday.

913
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,313
Aw, Jill. You know, I wanted to.

914
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:32,567
I even got you a present
and then I thought, you know,

915
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,653
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

916
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,906
What wrong idea, that you like me?

917
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,326
Well, you know that I like you.
I just...

918
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,079
I don't want you to have fantasies.

919
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:46,540
Why not?

920
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,584
Because you can do better than me.

921
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:53,922
Oh, God. Really, Abe?
Don't you think I can decide that?

922
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,258
All right. Here.

923
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,343
Happy birthday.

924
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,761
Oh, my God.

925
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:01,721
Is this my present?

926
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,098
Yeah, come on, it's nothing.

927
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:07,018
It's not nothing, Abe!
This is beautiful.

928
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,565
And it's Edna St. Vincent Millay.

929
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:14,442
You really are a romantic, aren't you?

930
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:18,405
I marked off the poems
I thought you'd like most, you'll see.

931
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:20,031
Mmm.

932
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,077
Well, what I know of hers,
I absolutely love.

933
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:32,419
What am I doin' sittin' here
opposite you over candlelight?

934
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,422
I said I wouldn't let this happen.

935
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,883
But it has happened.

936
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,886
Hey, come on.
We're celebrating, right?

937
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,429
It's been a pretty good day.

938
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:43,763
You had a birthday.

939
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,808
I don't wanna eat,
I wanna go to your place.

940
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,143
Jill.

941
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,728
I want to.

942
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,730
- No.
- Yes.

943
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,566
It's my birthday.

944
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:01,323
I swore I wouldn't,
but I don't know what's come over me.

945
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,620
What's come over you
is that you're finally celebrating life...

946
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:11,666
Instead of romanticizing death
with your crazy Russian Roulette.

947
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,796
You have a boyfriend.
I'm not going to get in the way of that.

948
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,175
Roy and I aren't exclusive,
I told you that.

949
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:22,135
I don't believe you.

950
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,678
Roy would say different.

951
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:26,348
I don't wanna talk about it.

952
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:29,184
I loved making love with you.

953
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,853
Yes, it was very nice for me, too.

954
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:34,189
Oh, it was just very nice?

955
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,319
I feel like I've accomplished
something worthwhile.

956
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:41,363
Like my life has meaning.

957
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:45,659
Well, I'm very flattered
that you think making love to me

958
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,452
has given your life meaning.

959
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:05,720
<i>My writing was flowing,
the creative juices unblocked.</i>

960
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,056
<i>I was happy and enjoying
a sense of well-being,</i>

961
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:11,851
<i>and I'd begun an affair with Jill,
something I'd been determined not to do,</i>

962
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,728
<i>and yet was carried along
on the sudden momentum</i>

963
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,814
<i>of the sheerjoy of living.</i>

964
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:18,233
<i>The thought that I had once been
indifferent to existence</i>

965
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,567
<i>seemed preposterous.</i>

966
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,495
How is everything?
I haven't seen you.

967
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,832
Yeah, really good, you know.
Everything's just been fallin' into place.

968
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,417
- Huh.
- You look great, as always.

969
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:39,421
I may have some free time next week,
if you wanna, you know...

970
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,672
Uh-huh.

971
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:43,383
Or am I encroaching on
your other love life?

972
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,759
Hey, give me a break.

973
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,261
Abe!

974
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:48,513
Hey, I tried to call you.

975
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,350
Did you see what happened?
Did you see the papers?

976
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,060
No, what?

977
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,938
Hi. Judge Spangler was murdered.

978
00:55:58,106 --> 00:55:59,774
- What are you talking about?
- He was murdered.

979
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:01,901
I don't understand.
Wasn't it a heart attack?

980
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,405
Yeah, it was a heart attack,
but they did an autopsy,

981
00:56:05,572 --> 00:56:08,199
and it wasn't cardiac arrest,
it was poison.

982
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,617
- Poison?
- Yeah. It was poison.

983
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,036
Somebody poisoned his juice.

984
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,642
- You've got to be kidding.
- I know.

985
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:14,748
Well, what made them do an autopsy?

986
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:16,458
Well, don't they always do an autopsy?

987
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,544
I think that they suspected that
it wasn't a heart attack right away,

988
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:22,464
and they just thought it was poison
and so they did the autopsy.

989
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,798
Who's Judge Spangler?

990
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:24,966
- He's a judge...
- This judge.

991
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,302
That we had overheard
someone talking about in a diner.

992
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:28,803
- This crazy story that some...
- Oh, yeah?

993
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,770
I don't have time for a crazy story
right now, but I will see you soon.

994
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,933
- Okay.
- I mean, can you believe that?

995
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,560
- No.
- Isn't it awful?

996
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,313
You know, he must've had a lot of enemies.

997
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,732
Well, God, I'm sure,
but we were celebrating.

998
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:43,985
I know, but you know,
I still can't say I'm sorry.

999
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,613
Well, who do you think it was?
Do you think it was the woman?

1000
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:48,490
- I don't know...
- Or, one of her friends or something?

1001
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,096
Well, what, what did the police say?

1002
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,787
<i>I'm Abe Lucas and I've murdered.</i>

1003
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:57,916
<i>I've had many experiences
and now a unique one.</i>

1004
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,001
<i>I've taken a human life.</i>

1005
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,337
<i>Not in battle or self-defense,</i>

1006
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:06,132
<i>but I made a choice I believed in
and I saw it through.</i>

1007
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,135
<i>I feel like an authentic human being.</i>

1008
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,515
Today we're gonna discuss
existential choice.

1009
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:16,309
That life has the meaning
you choose to give it.

1010
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,354
And we'll examine
Jean-Paul Sartre's wonderful insight,

1011
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,815
"Hell is other people."

1012
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,323
<i>Abe seemed
to have had a breakthrough.</i>

1013
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:35,537
<i>It was as if whatever had been stifling
his deepest feelings became unblocked.</i>

1014
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,218
<i>Police still have no clues</i>

1015
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:54,556
<i>in the murder of Judge Thomas Spangler,
who was poisoned in Lippitt Park weeks ago.</i>

1016
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,807
<i>At a press conference,</i>

1017
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,852
<i>investigators told reporters
all leads have been followed up,</i>

1018
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,563
<i>but so far there are no
persons of interest.</i>

1019
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,149
<i>They said that speculation
that the poison had been intended</i>

1020
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,025
<i>for someone other than Judge Spangler,</i>

1021
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,736
<i>was just speculation and unlikely.</i>

1022
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:12,907
You're wearing a new perfume.

1023
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:15,577
I love that you notice those things.

1024
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:19,205
I've become very attuned
to the sensual joys of life.

1025
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:22,542
Sights and sounds,
the taste of food and wine.

1026
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,671
What?

1027
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,922
What are you thinking?

1028
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:31,092
Today for one very funny moment,

1029
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:34,512
I thought it would be ironic
if you had killed Judge Spangler.

1030
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,267
Uh-huh, and how did I
perform that little miracle?

1031
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,935
I don't know, I don't know.

1032
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,105
I mean, you couldn't and you wouldn't.

1033
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,358
- It's got to be hard to kill somebody.
- Mmm.

1034
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,611
Especially to poison a stranger.

1035
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:53,198
Yeah, I mean, if I had to
eliminate someone, I think I'd...

1036
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:56,618
I don't know, use a gun or run him over.

1037
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,537
I mean, cyanide's a whole other deal.

1038
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:03,208
Was it cyanide?
The papers didn't say that.

1039
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,294
I always assume anyone poisoned,
is poisoned by cyanide.

1040
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:09,297
Oh, that's funny.
I always assume arsenic for some reason.

1041
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:10,965
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1042
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:15,220
Old movies or something.
It had to be someone that knew him.

1043
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,264
I mean, someone would have to
be close enough to him

1044
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,767
to drop poison in his coffee.

1045
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:22,810
Or I guess it was juice, wasn't it?

1046
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:25,647
<i>I enjoyed the whole conversation.</i>

1047
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,941
<i>It was like sitting at a tense poker table,</i>

1048
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:30,443
<i>holding a full house,
and chatting innocently...</i>

1049
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,320
<i>Confident I had the winning hand,</i>

1050
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,990
<i>but getting a thrill out of the chance
I could be beaten with a straight flush</i>

1051
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:37,784
<i>or four of a kind.</i>

1052
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:39,994
I had a big argument with Roy today.

1053
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,790
I don't like to hear that.

1054
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,794
I told him that I wanted
to be honest with him.

1055
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:52,257
And, that I still had
real feelings for him.

1056
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,176
But I also have feelings for you.

1057
00:59:55,843 --> 01:00:00,473
I must say, you were special
from that very first day.

1058
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,142
You are very lucky.

1059
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,520
I am very lucky.

1060
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,022
Mmm.

1061
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,528
So, what do you wanna talk about?

1062
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:15,530
Um...

1063
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,826
Look, I'm not gonna see you anymore.

1064
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,095
I can't operate under these conditions.

1065
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:26,040
I'm not just gonna wait around while
you play out your affair with Abe Lucas.

1066
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,461
Yeah, I understand.
That's not fair to you.

1067
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:34,382
Yeah, I'm just gonna move on.
Whatever happens, happens.

1068
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,677
- Are you seeing somebody else?
- No.

1069
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:42,056
But, obviously, you are, so,
I'm not gonna hold on from trying.

1070
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:45,893
That wouldn't be fair.

1071
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,481
It's too bad.
We had a good thing goin'.

1072
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:55,028
Hey, it's my fault, Roy.

1073
01:00:56,988 --> 01:01:00,074
I'm just really not ready
to commit to one person.

1074
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:01,492
Yeah.

1075
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,705
Dinner was delicious.

1076
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,513
And this pie...

1077
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:10,022
- It's so nice of you to have me over.
- Well, we're happy to.

1078
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,920
Particularly since Jill
always speaks so highly of you.

1079
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:16,257
Have you two been following
the Judge Spangler murder?

1080
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:19,093
Have we? We have a special
attachment to Judge Spangler.

1081
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,387
'Cause we overheard
some people talking about him,

1082
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:22,919
and what a rotten judge he was,

1083
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,892
and we kind of rooted for him
to have a coronary or get run over.

1084
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,770
I've jogged in that park with Sally Kelly.

1085
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,823
You know, when I first heard about it,
I thought someone poisoned him

1086
01:01:31,898 --> 01:01:34,567
at breakfast, and it kicked in
when he was in the park.

1087
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:36,444
But, you know, when I read
it was cyanide in his drink,

1088
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,279
my theory unraveled.

1089
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:42,367
You know, you were right, Abe.
It was cyanide.

1090
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,452
- Mmm-hmm.
- You said that very early on, didn't you?

1091
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:45,904
That's what they said it was.

1092
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:47,957
Yeah, well, like I said,
I always think cyanide.

1093
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:50,416
Cyanide's the cliché
because it's so quick and fatal.

1094
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,461
Arsenic takes time and is very painful.

1095
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,963
None of the herbicides
are quick and dispositive.

1096
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,132
I don't know anything about poisons.

1097
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,134
I don't, either, just what I read.

1098
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,470
Who'd wanna kill a judge?

1099
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:04,931
Only everybody,
every person he ever ruled against.

1100
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,267
But I think they looked into
everybody that knew him.

1101
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:12,230
Including that woman that we heard,
and they were all ruled out.

1102
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,774
That's why they think
it might be a sick prank,

1103
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,818
or intended for someone else.

1104
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:18,820
But it was quick-acting poison,

1105
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,906
so they would have to drop it in the cup
right there in the park.

1106
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:24,075
- Well, that makes sense.
- Mmm-hmm.

1107
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:25,660
But not an easy thing to do,

1108
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:28,830
with a total stranger,
in broad daylight, in a public place.

1109
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,833
Unless he was there with
someone he knew, and trusted.

1110
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,501
- A friend.
- A weekend. A weekend.

1111
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:36,003
A weekend early in the morning,
not a lot of people around.

1112
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,923
Had to be someone he knew.

1113
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,509
But I think they questioned
everyone that knew him.

1114
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:44,512
- They said it was a regular orange juice?
- Mmm-hmm.

1115
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,347
And he bought an orange juice
there every weekend

1116
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,183
and he'd read the paper after jogging.

1117
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:52,353
Well, then if it was routine,

1118
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,524
somebody could've come around
and just dropped the poison in his cup.

1119
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:59,152
- Someone...
- You know, he wouldn't be on a park bench

1120
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:01,112
reading the newspaper, unless he was alone.

1121
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:02,321
That rules out a friend.

1122
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,866
How do we know it was a man?
Maybe it was a woman.

1123
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,492
Oh, that's a good point.

1124
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,035
Maybe he turned his back.

1125
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:12,540
Someone appears out of the blue,
and drops something in his drink?

1126
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:17,044
Well, aren't those take-out juices
covered with a straw?

1127
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:22,300
Or someone could have gone to Pascal's
and gotten a juice,

1128
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:25,553
and put the poison in it
and switched it with the judge's.

1129
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,846
Hmm.

1130
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,973
I'm sure the police have
run through every theory.

1131
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,019
Okay, let's say the judge is
sitting in the park with his orange juice,

1132
01:03:33,186 --> 01:03:39,650
and, and along comes someone with
an exact matching cup full of poison...

1133
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,403
- Who comes along?
- And...

1134
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,989
- Well...
- Someone who wants to kill the judge.

1135
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:46,199
Whoever it was,

1136
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,493
would have to get the judge
to look away long enough

1137
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,702
to make the switch.

1138
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,412
- I mean, they'd be taking a huge risk...
- But think...

1139
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:52,872
They would sit down next to the judge,

1140
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,333
and the guy doesn't even have to know him,
he just is sitting there,

1141
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,502
and the judge is drinking his juice,
you know,

1142
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:01,672
and he sets it down next to him,
and this person is just...

1143
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,093
The judge opens up his paper, and he turns
and he's covered up for just long enough.

1144
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:08,179
Well, if he didn't know the judge,

1145
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:10,264
why would he wanna go
to all that trouble to kill him?

1146
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:13,184
Yeah, he'd have to be familiar with
the judge's routine, the details.

1147
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:14,602
But that would be easy.

1148
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,854
You could just stalk the judge
for a week and you would...

1149
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,190
I mean, it sounds like
this was his Saturday morning ritual.

1150
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:20,441
I like it.

1151
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,968
What Jill says makes sense.
It's a well-thought out concept.

1152
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:27,114
The judge reads the paper,
blocks his eye line, a quick switch.

1153
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:29,075
You know, if someone
sits next to you on a bench,

1154
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:31,244
you often turn away.

1155
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,496
I'm sure the police
are way ahead of us on all this.

1156
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:34,789
Mmm.

1157
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:47,218
<i>The murder of Spangler
remained a hot tabloid issue.</i>

1158
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:48,469
<i>Abe often talked about it</i>

1159
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:52,223
<i>and what a blessing it was for that woman,
now that the judge was gone.</i>

1160
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,767
<i>I didn't give any special thought to it,
until one day,</i>

1161
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,561
<i>when I ran into Ellie Tanner, a friend,</i>

1162
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,896
<i>that I sometimes went
horseback riding with.</i>

1163
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,481
No, no, it's fine.

1164
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:02,483
- Okay.
- He just, um...

1165
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:04,277
- Basically, we had this long conversation.
- Right.

1166
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:08,072
And he said that he felt like
I wasn't being fair to him.

1167
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,826
And he was right. I wasn't.
But I didn't know what to do anymore.

1168
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:15,288
You would love Abe.
He is so interesting.

1169
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,164
You know Rita Richards?

1170
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:20,001
Oh, yes, are you gonna tell me
that she had an affair with him?

1171
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,628
Because who on the faculty
has not slept with Rita Richards?

1172
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,132
No, she has this hilarious theory
about Abe Lucas.

1173
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:27,842
Oh, God, here we go.

1174
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:31,137
She thinks he would be a good suspect
in that case of the murdered judge.

1175
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:32,513
You know, the guy who's
all over the papers?

1176
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,432
Oh, please.

1177
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,518
- She's kidding.
- I mean, she's half-kidding.

1178
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:39,353
Oh, come on.

1179
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,355
How did she come to
that bizarre conclusion?

1180
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,524
I don't even remember.
We were at her husband's barbecue.

1181
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:44,811
And she starts yelling about

1182
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:47,194
how Abe had argued
that the judge deserved to die.

1183
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:48,613
And then something about...

1184
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,198
I don't know, the aesthetics
of committing a perfect crime.

1185
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,201
- Whatever, she's crazy.
- Oh, she's crazy!

1186
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,120
She's nuts.

1187
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:58,456
Hey, we should go
horseback riding again, soon.

1188
01:05:58,623 --> 01:06:01,000
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That was fun.

1189
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,542
<i>Naturally, I didn't believe
there was any substance</i>

1190
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:08,549
<i>to Rita Richards' so-called theory,
and yet, for some reason, it bothered me.</i>

1191
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,178
Here, two poems I wrote for you.

1192
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:14,138
- You didn't.
- I did.

1193
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:16,515
- Oh, my God.
- No, don't read them now.

1194
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,002
I'm too embarrassed.

1195
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:21,896
If you hate them, throw 'em away.
If they move you, they're yours.

1196
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,734
That's very sweet.

1197
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:30,696
Hey, is something wrong?

1198
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,406
- No.
- No?

1199
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,909
You seem a tiny bit off.

1200
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:37,161
No, I'm just moved.

1201
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:38,537
Without even reading them,

1202
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,415
I'm just moved by the gesture
of you writing these.

1203
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,417
Aw, clever student.

1204
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,507
Are you sure you're okay?

1205
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:53,761
I'm just looking at you.

1206
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:57,765
<i>It seemed absurd to me</i>

1207
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:01,560
<i>that I could entertain even
the slightest doubt about Abe.</i>

1208
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:03,270
<i>And then a week later,</i>

1209
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:06,607
<i>I got a chance to hear
Rita Richards' theory firsthand.</i>

1210
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:08,109
<i>I ran into her in a local bar</i>

1211
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,111
<i>where she had been
sitting alone and drinking,</i>

1212
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,363
<i>and was a little drunk and talkative.</i>

1213
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,090
- Hi.
- How are you, Miss Pollard?

1214
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,117
- Great.
- Hi, Kim. How's it goin'?

1215
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,035
Uh, can I catch up to you?

1216
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,121
- Hello.
- I was just thinking about you.

1217
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,288
I was just thinking about
you too, actually.

1218
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:22,707
- You were?
- Yes.

1219
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,208
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1220
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,460
I'm good.
I ran into Ellie Tanner actually.

1221
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,380
And she said that
you had a theory about Abe.

1222
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,259
Oh! Oh, yeah, well,
it's what's called a crackpot theory.

1223
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:36,470
But it's not totally off the wall.

1224
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,390
Well, I love a crackpot theory.

1225
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:41,809
- Yeah, you promise you won't tell?
- You have my word.

1226
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:44,145
You wanna hear it?
Sit down.

1227
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,149
You've been following that judge
who got poisoned in the papers?

1228
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,234
- Spangler? Judge Spangler.
- Spangler.

1229
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:51,652
- Spangler, right.
- Yes.

1230
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,280
Well, they don't know who did it.

1231
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:59,410
My theory is, uh...
Abe Lucas of our philosophy department.

1232
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:01,328
Our mutual crush.

1233
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:04,957
Well, you...
That's, that's very, very intriguing.

1234
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,668
Well, it's crazy, but it's not, you know?

1235
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,628
Well, why do you think Abe?

1236
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:12,673
- Well, once or twice, when I was alone...
- Could I have a white wine, please?

1237
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,761
Let's just say in, like, a moment
of post-passionate intimacy...

1238
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,262
- No, I understand...
- We'd talk, yeah.

1239
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,598
- You don't have to get too graphic...
- And we both said that

1240
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:23,434
we had experienced many things in life.

1241
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:26,312
But one thing that he
had never experienced,

1242
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,649
but wondered was
what it would be like to actually kill.

1243
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:34,695
- To kill?
- Yes.

1244
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:38,032
Well, that sounds like random,
silly, Abe talk.

1245
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,034
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's had a few.

1246
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:41,368
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
- He's dramatic.

1247
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:43,287
Oh, that's exactly
what I thought, too, you know?

1248
01:08:43,454 --> 01:08:44,538
It's just Abe being Abe.

1249
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:47,458
But then my husband
saw him leaving the campus,

1250
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,710
very early the morning
that the judge was poisoned.

1251
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:51,712
Like very early, like 6:30.

1252
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,799
I mean, have you ever known Abe
to get up at 6:30?

1253
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,884
He barely makes it to class on time.

1254
01:08:57,885 --> 01:09:01,722
Okay, then your theory is
that he gets up at 6:30,

1255
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:05,559
and he goes to Lippitt Park,
and he goes up to a total stranger,

1256
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,896
and he drops poison
in the juice of a total stranger.

1257
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:10,898
I mean, he didn't even know the judge.

1258
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:13,734
He couldn't get that close, and then,
if he knew the judge, he wouldn't...

1259
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:16,570
I mean, he just wouldn't do it.
He's radical, but he's not nuts.

1260
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,697
Let me give you the final tidbit.

1261
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,741
A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.

1262
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:24,245
Now I never lose anything,
but that key was missing from my bag,

1263
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:27,706
and it opens all the doors
to all the lab rooms

1264
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,418
that have all those
dangerous chemicals and poisons.

1265
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,380
All right, well...

1266
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:38,259
You sure have really got
that theory down, don't you?

1267
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:40,529
- Like I said...
- I'll think about it.

1268
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,429
I'll weigh it out.

1269
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:49,520
<i>There was no question
I was rattled by Rita's outrageous theory.</i>

1270
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:52,565
<i>I knew Abe had had a very angry reaction</i>

1271
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,568
<i>to the judge's unfair treatment
of that poor woman.</i>

1272
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:59,405
<i>And what was he doing out at 6:30
on a Saturday morning?</i>

1273
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:03,242
<i>My thoughts were very
mixed-up and troubled.</i>

1274
01:10:03,576 --> 01:10:06,704
<i>And more devastating revelations
were to come.</i>

1275
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:10,624
<i>But for the moment,
I lapsed into complete denial,</i>

1276
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:14,962
<i>and told myself this was too absurd
to even contemplate.</i>

1277
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:19,633
<i>I must not get carried away
with my overactive imagination.</i>

1278
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,386
<i>And yet, a dark cloud had crossed the Moon.</i>

1279
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:23,596
- Hey.
- Abe.

1280
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:25,442
What's on your mind?
What are you thinkin'?

1281
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:28,267
Nothing.

1282
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:31,979
I was actually, I was thinking
that I used to come here and jog.

1283
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,482
You know, I'll jog with you if you want.
I'd love to get back into shape.

1284
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:39,320
No, you'd have to get up very early.

1285
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,656
I run early and you're a night person.

1286
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,992
Yeah, well, that's why I quit last year.

1287
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,662
That and no will to extend my life,
but now...

1288
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:57,171
Rita Richards' husband actually
told me that he saw you leaving the campus

1289
01:10:57,338 --> 01:11:00,507
really early, at like 6:30 or something,
on a Saturday morning.

1290
01:11:01,926 --> 01:11:03,135
- 6:30?
- Yeah.

1291
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:04,929
Oh, yeah, that was the morning
Judge Spangler died.

1292
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,681
Yeah, I had to go to Providence for an MRI.

1293
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:09,350
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1294
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,852
- You didn't say anything.
- Well, I didn't want to alarm anyone.

1295
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,819
It was a little benign thing,
but the doctor wanted me to check it out.

1296
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,273
He didn't think it was anything horrible.

1297
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,942
- I'm glad it was nothing.
- Yeah.

1298
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,944
- Mmm.
- Don't worry.

1299
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,279
- I'm relieved.
- Mmm.

1300
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:27,034
<i>It was hard for me
to keep my mind on school work.</i>

1301
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:29,870
<i>I had this growing sense of anxiety.</i>

1302
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:34,208
<i>And realizing I always had
a tendency to overdramatize,</i>

1303
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:37,544
<i>I tried to keep my fantasies in check.</i>

1304
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:41,340
<i>And still, walking home,
I passed Abe's house,</i>

1305
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:44,385
<i>and knowing he would be
busy teaching all afternoon,</i>

1306
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,304
<i>I couldn't resist doing a crazy thing.</i>

1307
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,947
<i>Once I was inside Abe's house,
I felt I was betraying him.</i>

1308
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:49,408
<i>And I felt guilty and stupid.</i>

1309
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,870
<i>I couldn't imagine what I expected to find.</i>

1310
01:12:53,037 --> 01:12:56,957
<i>And yet on his desk</i>
<i>was a copy of</i> Crime and Punishment,

1311
01:12:57,416 --> 01:13:00,210
<i>with margin notes
that had Judge Spangler's name</i>

1312
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,963
<i>and a quote of Hannah Arendt's.</i>

1313
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,429
Oh, are you kidding?

1314
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,264
Jill!

1315
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:14,808
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

1316
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:17,644
Oh, you look so pretty.
I love your hair today.

1317
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,646
Oh, God, thank you.

1318
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,315
- It's a mess.
- Nuh-uh.

1319
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:23,233
Um, how's your paper coming?

1320
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,488
Good, actually, thanks to Abe Lucas.
I ran into him in the chem lab,

1321
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,740
and he gave me this
whole list of people to read

1322
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,910
to understand those confusing points
that I was talking about, so...

1323
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:34,495
- He was in the chem lab?
- Yeah.

1324
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,706
He was there after hours.
I really startled him. I felt so bad.

1325
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,001
What was he doing in the lab after hours?

1326
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,463
I don't know.
I think he's researching on a book,

1327
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,089
or something that he's writing about,

1328
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:48,342
like, poison or chemistry,
or one of those things, so...

1329
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:54,264
But in the lab, all that poison
and toxic stuff is locked away.

1330
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,225
Yeah, but he had a key.

1331
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:02,815
Hey, why are you actin' so strangely? Huh?

1332
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,024
What's so important we gotta go over it...

1333
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,026
You killed Spangler.

1334
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:08,862
- What?
- Didn't you?

1335
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,072
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you?

1336
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:14,201
You got cyanide from the chem lab,
and you slipped it into his juice in the park.

1337
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:16,703
You went to Lippitt Park,
you didn't get an MRI.

1338
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,206
- Listen to yourself. Jill, it's me.
- Is that true?

1339
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,375
- Don't...
- Are you nuts?

1340
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,920
Don't tap dance with me, Abe!
I saw in your book.

1341
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:27,256
I saw that you wrote,
"Spangler, the banality of evil."

1342
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,258
You must've decided that
he deserved to die.

1343
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:32,678
And so you stole Rita's keys,
and April saw you.

1344
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:34,388
- Hey, listen, come here.
- No.

1345
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,848
Come here.

1346
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:38,142
I made the choice to help that woman.

1347
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:39,810
You had it right the other night.

1348
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,312
I always said you had a
first-rate intelligence.

1349
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:45,149
In the park?
On the bench?

1350
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:49,486
The covering up, the...
Jesus, I felt that, Abe! I felt that!

1351
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,580
I always taught you to
trust your instincts.

1352
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:53,240
Not everything can be
grasped by the intellect.

1353
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:55,826
If it feels right, it often is.

1354
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,787
This was the meaningful act
I was searching for.

1355
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,207
You can't just take it upon yourself
to take someone's life.

1356
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,626
Well, I thought it was a very
reasonable thing to do.

1357
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:06,295
She hoped he'd get cancer!

1358
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:08,422
But what the hell is hoping?
Hoping is bullshit.

1359
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:10,257
You see, you have to act.

1360
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:14,344
You can't believe it was moral,
what you did.

1361
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,638
- You don't think that it was moral?
- Of course I do.

1362
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:19,099
I consider myself a moral man
who's lived a moral life,

1363
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:22,895
who came to the aid of a woman
suffering a great injustice.

1364
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,939
- So, what, are you gonna go to prison?
- No, the police are not thinking of me.

1365
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:28,483
You gonna go to prison
for the rest of your life?

1366
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:32,237
And they never will, because I'm a total
stranger to everybody, with no motive.

1367
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:35,782
This will be just another unsolved crime.

1368
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,160
Do you know that Rita Richards
has a theory that you did it?

1369
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:41,580
Yes, I know, she told me.
We had a big laugh over it.

1370
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,750
How could you do it, Abe?

1371
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,370
Is the world a better place
without this rotten judge?

1372
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:49,922
- Oh, my God, Jesus, Abe!
- No, I ask you.

1373
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,090
- Is the world a better place...
- No, this is...

1374
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,676
- Without Judge Spangler?
- I am so crushed, Abe!

1375
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:56,511
I'm completely lost.

1376
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:00,766
What do I do?

1377
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:03,769
What do you mean?
Meaning what?

1378
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:08,273
Meaning that I care about you
so much and I can't...

1379
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,525
I can't go on seeing you anymore.

1380
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:12,653
Oh...

1381
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:17,366
Are you thinking of turning me in?

1382
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:20,202
Yes, I'm thinking of turning you in.
Of course I am.

1383
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,079
- Jill...
- But I can't do that.

1384
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:23,446
I can't bring myself to do it.

1385
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,958
You, you... This is...

1386
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,834
This is crazy, Abe!

1387
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:30,837
I'm asking you to put
our everyday assumptions aside,

1388
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,548
and trust your experience of life.

1389
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:35,759
In order to really see the world,

1390
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:38,220
we must break with
our familiar acceptance of it.

1391
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:43,225
The second I decided to take this action,
my world changed.

1392
01:16:43,392 --> 01:16:44,601
You saw it.

1393
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:47,854
I suddenly found a reason to live.

1394
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:51,692
I could make love,
I could experience feelings for you,

1395
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,070
because to do this deed for this woman
gave my life meaning.

1396
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,365
You have to leave, Abe.

1397
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:03,412
You gotta go.
I can't see you ever again.

1398
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:07,416
I won't say anything.

1399
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,251
I won't say anything.

1400
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:10,460
But I...

1401
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,425
I believe that you think you did
something morally worthwhile.

1402
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,468
- I did!
- I do believe that. No, but I...

1403
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,762
- But you can't, you can't justify it!
- Shh!

1404
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:23,348
You can't justify it
with all this bullshit.

1405
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:27,477
With all this bullshit,
French postwar rationalizing.

1406
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,813
This doesn't...
This is murder.

1407
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:31,273
This is murder.

1408
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,650
It opens the door to more murder, Abe.

1409
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:35,402
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

1410
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,238
I don't have the intellect
to refute these arguments.

1411
01:17:38,405 --> 01:17:39,781
I can't argue with you.

1412
01:17:40,032 --> 01:17:42,909
But you taught me to go with my instinct,

1413
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,039
and I don't have to think about this.
I feel that this is no good.

1414
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:49,082
This is murder.

1415
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,209
Good job today.

1416
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:54,254
<i>The next few weeks
were the hardest of my life.</i>

1417
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:56,298
<i>I loved Abe and truly believed</i>

1418
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:59,801
<i>his misguided intention
was to do a heroic thing.</i>

1419
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:03,388
<i>I argued his position
in my head over and over.</i>

1420
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:06,767
<i>And at times I weakened
and felt he was an original thinker,</i>

1421
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,977
<i>who couldn't be judged
by middle-class rules.</i>

1422
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:15,108
You seem so down lately.
Did something happen with Abe?

1423
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,319
He's leaving the school.

1424
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,154
I guess it's just as well.

1425
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,365
How are you taking it?

1426
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:24,701
Not great.

1427
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:30,374
I'm sure Roy will be thrilled to hear that.

1428
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,625
You know, it's so funny.

1429
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,836
I used to think of Roy as wonderful,

1430
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:38,924
but just very uninspired, compared to Abe.

1431
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,885
And now I'm starting to think that

1432
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:45,263
I've really been more
suited for Roy all along.

1433
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,935
I guess I'm not as cutting edge
as I imagined myself.

1434
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:57,818
Is it true?

1435
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:00,404
I heard that Abe is moving on.

1436
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:02,197
Yes.

1437
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:05,325
- Yeah, that's true.
- I'm going to miss him.

1438
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:09,996
I guess he found Braylin a little tame
for his restless temperament.

1439
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:14,418
He's thinking of moving to Europe.

1440
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,670
Can I tell you something?

1441
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:18,380
Sure.

1442
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:21,633
I wish he'd go to Spain
and take me with him.

1443
01:19:22,426 --> 01:19:23,552
Hmm.

1444
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:28,306
You know, he said that
you two had a pretty big laugh

1445
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,642
over your theory that
he was the Lippitt Park killer.

1446
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:32,769
We did have a good laugh over it.

1447
01:19:33,478 --> 01:19:35,856
And yet,
if it turned out to be that he did it,

1448
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:40,819
you know, I'd be surprised,
but not stunned.

1449
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,113
Not flabbergasted.

1450
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:48,368
I'd still let him take me to Spain.

1451
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,205
<i>I played out
my last few weeks at Braylin</i>

1452
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,875
<i>and made plans to go off
to Europe to teach.</i>

1453
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,794
<i>I still felt justified in what I'd done.</i>

1454
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,464
<i>I felt that I'd experienced
something unique and deeper,</i>

1455
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,383
<i>from all my social
protests or charity work.</i>

1456
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,636
<i>I'd helped a family and hurt no one,
but he who deserved it.</i>

1457
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,264
<i>A man who took advantage
of his power to hurt others.</i>

1458
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:12,976
<i>I knew Jill would never betray me.</i>

1459
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:15,812
<i>But then things took on a new twist.</i>

1460
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,399
Well, there goes my theory.
I guess I'll never work for the FBI.

1461
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:21,359
What does it say?

1462
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:23,295
"Police are certain
they have the person

1463
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,280
"who poisoned Judge Thomas Spangler,

1464
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:28,617
"the family court judge
who was murdered in Lippitt Park.

1465
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:31,661
"The alleged killer, Albert Podesta,
a medical laboratory worker,

1466
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,457
"had access to the same kind of cyanide
that was used in the murder.

1467
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:39,211
"Podesta, who denies
he had anything to do with it,

1468
01:20:39,377 --> 01:20:41,713
"had testified before
Spangler two years ago,

1469
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,176
"and had been enraged with the judge for
his ruling in a case against his brother.

1470
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:49,596
"If convicted,
Podesta faces life imprisonment."

1471
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,601
What do you plan to do about this?

1472
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:58,146
I don't know.

1473
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:00,273
You don't know?

1474
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:04,528
Oh, surely, you're not gonna let an
innocent man take the rap for you, Abe.

1475
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,489
I've been up and back over this
since I heard the news.

1476
01:21:07,656 --> 01:21:09,783
"Up and back"?
What does that mean?

1477
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,869
It means that I tried to bring off
the perfect crime,

1478
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:14,676
and apparently, I succeeded all too well.

1479
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:17,624
Okay, well, what about all your talk
about moral high ground?

1480
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,876
Look, I need to think this out, all right?

1481
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,962
What is there to think about?

1482
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,422
An innocent man
is about to have his life ruined.

1483
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:26,883
Okay, I'll give myself up.

1484
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,468
Is that what you want?

1485
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,762
Isn't that what you want?

1486
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:36,142
I mean, all this talk, talk, talk,
about doing the right thing,

1487
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:38,103
and what's best, and...

1488
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,855
Okay, if they don't see
that they're making a mistake

1489
01:21:41,106 --> 01:21:43,400
and let him go in a few days,
then I'll just...

1490
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:45,443
I'll fuckin', I'll turn myself in!

1491
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:50,115
I haven't been able to
live with myself as it is!

1492
01:21:50,282 --> 01:21:51,449
And this is a...

1493
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,578
We're talking about an innocent man
that's gonna be prosecuted for this!

1494
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:58,582
I know, I agree! Let me just see
if my luck holds out,

1495
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:02,085
and they come to realize that
they made a mistake, you know?

1496
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:05,255
Because I mean... Look at me!

1497
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:09,134
- I'm not gonna fuckin' make it!
- I know, I understand. I get...

1498
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,053
You have to do it by Monday, though, Abe.

1499
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,681
You got to do it by Monday,
or else I'm gonna have to do it.

1500
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:16,016
- I'm gonna have to do it.
- You stop that.

1501
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:17,934
- You don't have to do anything, all right?
- Abe...

1502
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:19,728
Just give me till Monday, please?

1503
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:22,105
Look at me, please?
Just give me till Monday?

1504
01:22:22,314 --> 01:22:24,024
Okay? I promise.

1505
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:26,818
- First thing in the morning on Monday.
- Okay, okay.

1506
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:29,321
You have to do it, Abe, or I will do it.
I will do it.

1507
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:32,407
You don't have to do anything, I promise.

1508
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,452
God damn it, Abe.

1509
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,336
<i>But I had no intention
of giving myself up.</i>

1510
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:47,005
<i>A few months ago,
my life meant nothing to me.</i>

1511
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,799
<i>I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.</i>

1512
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:53,053
<i>I'd have been fine if that
little game of Russian Roulette ended it.</i>

1513
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:56,765
<i>But since I planned and executed
the elimination of Judge Spangler,</i>

1514
01:22:56,931 --> 01:22:59,142
<i>my life had taken a new turn.</i>

1515
01:22:59,309 --> 01:23:00,894
<i>I understood why people loved life</i>

1516
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:03,521
<i>and saw it as something
joyous to experience.</i>

1517
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,565
<i>I did get pleasure out of living.</i>

1518
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:09,027
<i>I didn't want to commit suicide,
or spend my remaining days behind bars.</i>

1519
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:13,531
<i>I wanted to live, to teach, to write,
to travel, to make love.</i>

1520
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:17,160
<i>That night, I went to bed with Rita,</i>

1521
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:21,456
<i>and even entertained the thought
of takin' her with me to Europe.</i>

1522
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:25,335
I would leave Paul in a minute.

1523
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:32,258
Are you serious?
About Europe, really?

1524
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:35,136
What if I was?

1525
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:42,060
I couldn't believe it.
That's, um...

1526
01:23:42,227 --> 01:23:44,062
It would be a dream.

1527
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:47,816
And start over in Rome or Spain or...

1528
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:51,277
London?

1529
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,114
<i>The police had their suspect.</i>

1530
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,950
<i>Rita Richards, who was never really
serious about suspecting me,</i>

1531
01:23:57,117 --> 01:24:01,329
<i>would see it was another man
and that her crackpot theory was crackpot.</i>

1532
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:04,416
<i>The morality of letting someone take
the rap troubled me greatly,</i>

1533
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:08,253
<i>but paled against the hardwiring
of my natural will to survive.</i>

1534
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:12,632
<i>Europe with Rita was beginning
to have an exciting ring to it.</i>

1535
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:15,885
<i>Her passion for love and lust
was contagious.</i>

1536
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,972
<i>Only one thing stood in the way.</i>

1537
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:24,185
<i>I had a few days before Jill would insist
I clear the wrongfully accused man.</i>

1538
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:27,355
<i>Was there a way to keep her from talking?</i>

1539
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:32,402
<i>I guess she was right when she said
that one murder opens the door to more.</i>

1540
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:38,241
Jill, I never stopped caring about you.

1541
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:41,536
It was you who wasn't sure how you felt.

1542
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,830
I was so stupid, Roy.

1543
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,750
I was so stupid, I'm...

1544
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,587
If you say you never want to see me again,
I'll honestly say, I deserve it.

1545
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:53,131
But what happened
to make you change your mind?

1546
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:55,675
I don't want to talk about Abe.

1547
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,469
I'll never understand him.

1548
01:24:57,635 --> 01:25:01,431
That's fine. I never wanted to talk
about him the whole time, anyway.

1549
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:05,310
God, you're too understanding.

1550
01:25:05,477 --> 01:25:07,353
You should be angrier with me.

1551
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,857
Jill, I'm so in love with you,
but I just...

1552
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,860
I just feel like there's something
that you're keeping from me.

1553
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,280
I'll tell you on Monday.

1554
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:18,990
Okay.

1555
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,950
- All right?
- Okay.

1556
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:23,536
On Monday, you'll know everything,
I promise.

1557
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:24,871
Okay.

1558
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:32,587
I never believed we'd actually break up.

1559
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:36,007
I'm sad to say, but the time has come.

1560
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:40,804
And we need to talk about arrangements.

1561
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:46,184
This is a big step for me.

1562
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:50,021
You've known all along
I've wanted to live abroad.

1563
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:51,856
Yes, yes, but...

1564
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:55,360
- I want you to reconsider.
- Please.

1565
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:56,986
- Please.
- No.

1566
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,865
Let's just talk about the details, okay?

1567
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,506
<i>Her death would have
to look like an accident.</i>

1568
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:01,759
<i>And I ran through all the ones
she might have and it hit me.</i>

1569
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:06,681
<i>My brief time running an elevator during
my college days might now pay off.</i>

1570
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:11,394
<i>Funny how often your best ideas
come under pressure of a deadline.</i>

1571
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:13,563
<i>It was perfect.</i>

1572
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,607
<i>Saturday was her piano lesson.</i>

1573
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:19,944
<i>Most of the offices were closed.
There was very little action in the building.</i>

1574
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:22,322
<i>I couldn't make it look like
the elevator had been tampered with,</i>

1575
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,574
<i>but I knew enough
how to make it seem broken.</i>

1576
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,214
Hi.

1577
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:25,885
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

1578
01:28:26,469 --> 01:28:28,012
- Hi.
- I just...

1579
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:31,140
I wanted to talk to you
before I go to the police.

1580
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,559
All right, if it's about anything other
than turning yourself in,

1581
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:35,728
- I don't want to talk about it, all right?
- No, no...

1582
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,897
I see no other way. I just...

1583
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:40,191
I want to apologize
for all the trouble I've caused.

1584
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:42,360
I mean, I just... I can't believe this.

1585
01:28:42,527 --> 01:28:44,320
Oh, God. Oh, Abe.

1586
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,324
Oh, it's a nightmare, I know.

1587
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:53,121
I don't see any other way
than just telling them the whole story.

1588
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:55,623
What? That I murdered a judge?

1589
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,458
I know. I'm going to stand behind you.

1590
01:28:57,625 --> 01:29:00,336
- I will, as a friend.
- No, it won't matter, you know?

1591
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:01,671
It's premeditated murder.

1592
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:03,923
I mean, I don't...
They'll put me away for life.

1593
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:07,010
No, maybe they won't.
Hey, maybe with a good lawyer.

1594
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:10,346
- We don't know.
- Come on, who are we kidding?

1595
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:14,100
You know, I just, I can't...

1596
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,288
<i>With the passage of time,</i>

1597
01:30:17,455 --> 01:30:20,625
<i>the awful vividness
of what I had experienced,</i>

1598
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:25,338
<i>gradually, very gradually,
grew less and less traumatic.</i>

1599
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:30,843
<i>It helped having a boyfriend
who was so loving and supportive.</i>

1600
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:35,181
<i>Every now and then,
I reflected on the whole episode.</i>

1601
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:39,894
<i>And with hindsight, gained some
perspective about life and love,</i>

1602
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:42,021
<i>and who I was.</i>

1603
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:46,484
<i>I even experienced,
for one terrifying moment,</i>

1604
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,820
<i>the closeness of death.</i>

1605
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:54,992
<i>The whole thing had been quite a lesson.
A painful lesson.</i>

1606
01:30:56,536 --> 01:31:00,289
<i>The kind Abe used to say
you can't get from any textbook.</i>
