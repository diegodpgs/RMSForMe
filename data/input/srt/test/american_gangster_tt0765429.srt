That you found a million dollars

01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,193
Mr. Roberts? I'm here for our appointment.

1082
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,638
- Morning.
- Morning.

1083
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,951
Sorry. Our appointment?

1086
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,233
She did mention your name, though.

1087
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,515
The stewardess?

1088
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,511
No, not the stewardess.

1089
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,790
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1090
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,914
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

1091
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,956
BOY 1: All right, go! Go, go!

Get in the pool. Go on.

1096

Come on. Come on.

1097
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,917
So, how'd she get my name?

1098
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,434
- Laune.
- Hmm.

1099
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,829
She's been saying a lot lately.

1100
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,869
A lot.

1101
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:18,240
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1102
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,549
I took it very seriously.

1103
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,551
I know. I know and I appreciate that.

1104
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,598
And I said yes,
I would take on this responsibility.

1105
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,274
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something happened to you.

1106
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,273
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

1107
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,079
made me look really bad, all right.

Old friends like you, yeah.

01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,313
Okay, I understand.

1115
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,439
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1116
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,756
No, don't lie. You don't have to lie.

1117
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,992
Just, omit certain details.

1118
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,438
Sure. All right.

1119
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,800
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

1120
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,629
- Something else.
- You don't have to answer if you don't want.

Blue Magic. Anything?

1122
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,077
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

1123
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,595
What, your guys?

Guys down south. That's all I heard.

- Cubans?
- I don't know.

1128
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,834
Not Mexico.

I don't know.

1130
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,196
You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

1131

I don't know.

1132
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:49,635
All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're
upsetting the natural order of things.

I want you to put him on the Yankees.

- He feels terrible.

I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,840
Of course. Excuse me.

1207
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,197
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1208
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,110
What do you think of monopolies?

1209
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,515
You mean like the game?

1210
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,235
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in the country, Frank,

1211
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,590
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1212
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,718
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1213
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,434
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

1214
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,557
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1215
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,159
Just trying to make a living.

1216
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,791
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1217
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:42,358
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1218
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,796
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1219
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,917
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1220
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,798
could never represent
the true cost of production

1221
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,351
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1222
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,954
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1223
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,360
- I don't think it's fair.
- You don't?

1224
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,959
- I don't think it's fair.
- I think it's fair.

1225
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,031
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1226
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,873
bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1227
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,511
But we fellow dairy farmers out here,
Frank, are you thinking of us?

1228
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,952
You thinking of them?

1229
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,111
- The dairy farmers?
- Yeah.

1230
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,990
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

1231
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,390
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1232

If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1531
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,121
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1532
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,238
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you
don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

1533
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:58,153
You can make enough money off it the way
it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

1534
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,072
Anything more than that is greed, son.

1535
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,071
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

1536
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,197
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1537
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:08,160
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

1538
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:11,120
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1539
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,840
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1540
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,198
I don't care, just don't let me catch you
doing this again.

1541
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,914
Catch me? Infringement? Insist?

1542
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,832
I don't like these words as much as,

1543
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,679
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

1544
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,950
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1545
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,600
without an invitation! You hear me?

1546
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,880
My man.

1547
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,392
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that
the cops there, man?

1548
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,033
It's all right.

1549
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,033
The hell they're gonna
do, give us a ticket?

1550
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,430
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1551
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,355
What?

1552
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,590
Some of it's in the trunk.

1553
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,072
- How you doing, Frank?
- I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

1554
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,594
How was your Thanksgiving?

1555
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,321
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1556
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,790
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1557
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,110
- Where's the Shelby at?
- The Shelby's gone, Frank.

1558
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,634
- The Shelby's gone?
- Stay right there.

1559
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,631
Yes, sir. Right here.

1560
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,273
TRUPO: You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1561
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,112
RICHIE: Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

1562
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,793
SPEARMAN: Is that him?
RICHIE: Yeah.

1563
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,393
Fucking prick.

1564
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,392
(EXCLAIMING)

1565
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,035
- Come over here a minute, Frank.
- Yeah.

1566
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,395
What are we gonna do about this?

1567
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,869
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1568
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,600
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1569
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:50,512
I got a better idea.

1570
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:55,031
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

1571
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:58,192
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

1572
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,670
- I loved that car.
- I know.

1573
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,078
RICHIE: What's he doing? Shakedown!

1574
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,910
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1575
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,121
SPEARMAN: Look at that shit.

1576
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,040
Sorry, Frank.

1577
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,396
It's all right. Go and get in the car.

1578
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,391
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

1579
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,235
RICHIE: All right, you call me back.

1580
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:50,673
INS, IRS, FBI. I can't get a
damn thing out of any of them.

1581
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:56,153
Because they all think you're on the take.
And you think they are.

1582
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:59,153
You know,
I don't think they want this to stop.

1583
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,675
I think it employs too many people.

1584
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:07,870
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

1585
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,595
They stop bringing dope into this country,

1586
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,433
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.

1587
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:18,718
Spearman.

1588
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:22,196
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

1589
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,555
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

1590
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,271
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

1591
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,955
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1592
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,475
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1593
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,791
- If you want we can assign someone to you.
- FBI protection.

1594
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,156
You know what? My life
is dangerous enough as it is.

1595
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,277
Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

1596
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,837
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

1597
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,030
Take care.

1598
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,475
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1599
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,996
We know that you keep calling about him.

1600
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,237
<i>We believe that peace is at hand.</i>

1601

<i>As I said earlier...</i>

1604
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,235
Yeah.

1605
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,311
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1606
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:44,073
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1607
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,080
RICHIE: What the fuck is a microwave?

1608
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,992
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1609
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,957
- Yeah?
- JOEY: Yeah.

1610
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,156
It rearranges the molecules.

1611
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,356
RICHIE: Of what?
JOEY: Of what? Of popcorn.

(BUZZER BEEPING)

1613
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,319
Of your head. Stick it in. Go on.

1614
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,671
I can get you one of those.

1615
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:29,111
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1616
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:31,073
No, thank you.

1617
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,757
Hey. Where is that?

1618
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:47,198
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

1619
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,038
Who?

1620
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:50,952
Burt Reynolds.

1621
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:54,795
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1622
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,839
A lot people from Hollywood go up
there now. They're buying up everything.

1623
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,593
- This is your place?
- Mmm.

1624
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:04,560
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1625
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,792
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

1626
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,153
It's your place.

1627
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,794
Isn't there something we can do,

1628
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,473
about leaving the big guy alone?

1629
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,517
You know who I mean.

1630
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,195
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1631
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:45,113
I do report it, then the trouble is yours.

1632
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,590
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1633
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,994
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1634
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:56,152
How do you know? Because we're friends.

1635
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,709
And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.

1636
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,711
From who? Your uncle?

1637
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,920
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

1638
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,399
Because

1639
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,950
I care what happens to you.

1640
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,877
You shouldn't have done this.

1641
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,191
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1642
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,714
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1643
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,879
Frank Lucas?

1644
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,229
Yeah.

1645
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,793
You tell Marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.

1646
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,073
Tell her why.

1647

- Talk! Talk!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1648
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,870
- Are you Richie Roberts?
- Yes, so what?

1649
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,830
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1650

Look, I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1653
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,630
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1654
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,400
Don't punish me for being honest.

(SCOFFS)

1657
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,196
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1658
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,511
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1659
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,114
No, you don't take money for one reason.

1660
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,431
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1661
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,557
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

1662
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:24,917
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1663
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,510
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1664
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,319
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1665
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:33,357
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

1666
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:37,638
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

1667
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,559
I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.

1668
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,750
You...

1669
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:46,437
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

1670
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:49,160
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.

Miss Dickerson,
before the court renders its opinion,

1675
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,719
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1676
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,552
Yes, Your Honor.

1677
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,792
Your Honor, a lot has been said here today
about how unsavory.

1678
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,914
Mr. Roberts' environment is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1679
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,789
We tell him to protect us.

02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,152
the plane and its cargo.

1986
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,709
Well, you don't have my permission.

1987
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,839
I don't need it, Captain.

1988
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:50,189
Easy! Easy, boy. Come on. Hey! Easy!

1989
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,476
Frank, move out of the way.

02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,270
TRUPO: Hey. Help me out with this.

1996
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,349
That was a military transport plane.

1997
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,640
If there was heroin on board,

1998
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,552
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1999
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:56,111
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

2000
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:58,555
the military is smuggling narcotics.

2001
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,314
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

2002
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:03,073
That someone employed by this office

2003
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:06,710
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

2004
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:10,196
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains of young men

2005
02:18:10,280 --> 02:18:13,193
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

2006
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,840
- There is dope on that plane.
- Shut the fuck up!

2007
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:20,711
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

2008
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,996
the entire federal narcotics program
is now in jeopardy

2009
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:26,072
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

2010
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,992
as that fucking transport plane?

2011
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,594
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

2012
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:32,751
I had good information.

2013
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:36,390
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

2014
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:38,391
- And that target is?
- Frank Lucas.

2015
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:40,596
- Who?
- His name's Frank Lucas.

2016
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:43,274
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

2017
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:45,431
He's not Italian. He's black.

Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

2020
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:53,956
You're this close to the end of your career
in law enforcement

2021
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:56,680
and you're making fucking jokes?

2022
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:59,070
My investigation indicates

2023
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,636
that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia
in the dope business.

2024
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:04,233
My investigations also indicate

2025
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:08,518
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

2026
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:11,752
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

2027
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:15,714
and personnel to transport
pure number 4 heroin into the United States

2028
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:19,873
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

2029
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:22,873
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organization.

the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

You called and they came running.

2056
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:15,596
That's because they look up to you.

2057
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:19,992
They always expect you
to know what's best.

2058
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,430
But even they know

2059
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,352
you don't shoot cops.

would you do it again?

02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:08,436
You represent progress.

2293
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:11,990
The kind of progress that's going
to see them lose a lot of money.

2294
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:15,675
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2295
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:18,034
My man.

2296
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:25,190
You know what normal is to me, Richie?

2297
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:28,352
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2298
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:32,314
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2299
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:35,392
dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,

2300
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:38,632
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2301
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,997
Then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head and knock his fucking head off.

2302
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,354
That's what normal is to me.

2303
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:46,512
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

2304
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:49,592
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2305
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,230
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

2306
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:54,789
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2307
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:57,833
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

2308
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:03,313
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

2309
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:08,080
All right.

2310
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:13,314
What do you want to do?

2311
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:21,553
You know what you got to do.

2312
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:23,438
What do you want me to do? Snitch, huh?

2313
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:24,999
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2314
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:27,196
What do you want? You want gangsters?

2315
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:31,069
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2316
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:34,273
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2317
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:38,194
I don't give a fuck about no crime figures.
You can have them.

2318
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:40,873
I'll take them, too.

2319
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:42,871
You'll take them, too?

2320
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,709
No, you didn't. You're talking about police.
You want police?

2321
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:53,315
You want your own kind?

2322
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,357
They're not my kind.

2323
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:58,154
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

2324
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:02,154
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are not yours. All right?

2325
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:06,475
Huh.

2326
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:18,195
What can you promise me, Richie?

2327
02:40:21,160 --> 02:40:24,596
I can promise you, you lie about one name,

2328
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:26,591
you'll never get out of prison.

2329
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:29,439
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

2330
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:31,830
you'll never get out of prison.

2331
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:37,153
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2332
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:40,274
or be poor outside for some of them.

2333
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:43,555
That's what I can promise you.

2334
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:52,555
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

2335
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:57,117
that took that money out of my pockets.

2336
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:01,393
Him, too.

2337
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:03,391
All right. Okay.

2338
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:07,516
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2339
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:10,754
So these guys are all connected up
to Gwynn, all right.

2340
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:13,474
See this guy here, he's in uniform...

You know...

2367

You don't want a drink or something?
Celebrate?

Frank. There you are.

- Caffe latte. Yeah.
- Latte?

- Oh, shit. Yeah.
- You all right?

That's a fancy way of saying

No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.
It's probably best for them.

Who's this?

2385
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:23,759
Expensive sneakers. About $100 a pair.

A superstar?

2396

Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

Thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.

Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

What?

2401
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:45,832
Ain't nothin', man. Ain't nothin', man.

2402
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:48,750
That's life right there.
That's life right there.

2403
