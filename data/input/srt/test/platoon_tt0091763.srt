1
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,286
Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

2
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,497
All right, you cheese-dicks,
welcome to the Nam.

3
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,666
Follow me.

4
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,468
Dipped in shit! New meat!

5
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,804
- You dudes gonna love the Nam!
- For fucking ever!

6
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,057
365 and a wake-up!

7
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,976
- Oh, Lord!
- Sin loi, buddy.

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,197
SEPTEMBER 1967,
BRAVO COMPANY, 25TH INFANTRY

9
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,492
SOMEWHERE NEAR
THE CAMBODIAN BORDER

10
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,470
Get him up here.

11
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,158
Sky Six, Ripper
Six, radio check. Over.

12
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,875
Watch it below!

13
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,109
Morehouse, drop back to slack!

14
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,204
Who's on tail end? Charlie?

15
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,635
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six.
Pos rep follows...

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,267
Warren, you get out on flank.

17
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,979
- Say, Hoffmeister!
- Yo?

18
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
- Got a smoke?
- No, man, I don't!

19
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
Sin loi, man.

20
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,319
Bravo Two-Six,

21
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,656
what's the delay up on point?
You having compass trouble again?

22
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,623
Come on, you... Shit!

23
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
Get a move on, boy!

24
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,844
Hey, boy, what ya waiting for?

25
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,013
He ain't gonna bite you.

26
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,182
That's a good gook.

27
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,517
Good and dead.

28
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
Yo! Tony!

29
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:23,383
252 actual. move it out. Six says
we're jamming 'em up back there.

30
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,886
Tell that dipshit to get fucked!

31
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,973
Bravo, it's Two-Five. Be advised,
we're moving out shortly. Out.

32
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,018
What the hell's the matter
with you, Taylor?

33
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,855
- You are one simple sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, Sergeant.

34
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,484
Get that other cherry up here -
Gardner. And the doc.

35
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,694
Gardner! Doc! Up!

36
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,989
Gardner, Doc, to the front!

37
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,742
- Gardner, up!
- Gardner, up!

38
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,787
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

39
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,956
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

40
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,432
You all right?

41
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,310
Ants. I got ants all over my neck.

42
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,064
You got some red ants.

43
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,233
Reds are killers.

44
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,778
Black ants are the worst.

45
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,947
Hurry up, lard-ass!

46
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,330
Just a little. Don't drink too much.

47
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,626
I don't want you drinking any more.
I don't want you cramping up.

48
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,254
You're humping too much stuff, troop.

49
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,464
You don't need half this shit.

50
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,718
I'll haul it for you,

51
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,138
but next time you check
with me first, all right?

52
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,724
OK. Thanks, Sarge.

53
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,648
Are you OK?

54
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,400
Yeah.

55
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,827
Two-Two, this is Six.

56
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,081
I understand you have a bird
inbound at your pos at this time.

57
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,544
Bravo Six, Bravo Six, be advised,

58
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,840
re-supply helo is inbound
at this time. Over.

59
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,513
Let's go, you people!
Get that ammo off now!

60
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,188
Let's move it!

61
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,558
It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R,

62
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,312
and "Sarah" ain't got no two Rs, King.
Damn, you dumb!

63
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,108
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

64
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,653
She don't read too good nohow!

65
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,702
Look at this shit! Pork again!

66
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,747
Let me have that turkey loaf
for this pork shit. I can't eat this shit!

67
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,375
What you been smoking, Junior?

68
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,004
I hope you don't get that laundry gig.
I hope manny get it,

69
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,464
cos your ass need to hump,
hump and hump!

70
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,050
Hey, white boy... what you waiting for?

71
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,344
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

72
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,308
Come on, get your dick-skin on that thing!
Dig! You ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

73
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:05,230
Somebody once wrote:
"Hell is the impossibility ofreason".

74
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,400
That's what this place feels like - hell.

75
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,861
I hate it already and it's only been a week.

76
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,655
Some goddamn week, Grandma.

77
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,327
The hardest thing l1ve ever done is
go on point. Three times this week.

78
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,329
I don't know what l1m doing.

79
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,082
A gook could be three feet in front ofme
and I wouldn't know it.

80
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,168
I'm so tired.

81
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,337
We get up at 5am,

82
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,215
hump all day,
camp around four or five,

83
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,383
dig a foxhole, eat,

84
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,887
then put out an all-night ambush
or a three-man listening post.

85
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,182
It's scary cos nobody tells me
how to do anything, cos I'm new.

86
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:44,686
Nobody cares about new guys.
They don't even wanna know your name.

87
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:49,024
A new guy's life isn't worth as much
cos he hasn't put his time in yet.

88
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,610
They say ifyou're gonna get killed
in the Nam,

89
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,613
it's better to get it in the first few weeks.

90
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,282
The logic being
you don't suffer that much.

91
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,118
If you're lucky,
you stay in the perimeter at night.

92
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,246
Then you pull a three-hour guard shift.

93
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,208
Maybe you sleep three, four hours
a night... But you don't really sleep.

94
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:17,052
I don't think I can keep this up
for a year, Grandma.

95
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,264
I think I've made a big mistake
coming here.

96
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,561
Mm-hm. We got boo-coo movement.

97
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,732
Third Battalion just got hit
15 kliks north of here.

98
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,610
Charlie had claymores
strung up in the trees,

99
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,488
blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.

100
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,657
Bad shit.

101
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,455
Yeah. They got two lieutenants
and a captain.

102
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,207
Jesus!

103
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,419
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

104
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,214
Elias... you take your squad out.

105
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,553
Warren, you stay in, but I'll need
Tex and Junior from your squad.

106
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,098
- Roger that.
- OK, move out in two-zero mikes.

107
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:07,811
- I thought it was O'Neill's turn.
- No! Tubbs and morehouse are short.

108
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,940
Fu Sheng's on an R and R tomorrow, and
you wanna send them out on an ambush?

109
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,276
Uh-uh. You got the fresh meat, buddy.

110
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,655
They don't know shit, and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

111
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,491
That's just great, Bob.
What do you want me to do?

112
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:26,288
Send one of my guys to get zapped, so
some lame-ass can get his beauty sleep?

113
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,624
- Nah!
- Hey, O'Neill...

114
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,628
Take a break! You don't have to
be a prick every day of your life!

115
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,796
Elias, get your men ready.

116
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,092
He's in three years and thinks
he's Jesus fucking Christ!

117
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,348
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,
but you go out. I need veterans out there.

118
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,310
Sergeant Barnes.

119
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,479
Sergeant.

120
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:57,277
I think, in front of the men,
it's necessary for me to give the orders.

121
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,200
Yes, sir.

122
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,497
Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

123
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,500
It's gonna piss on us all night.

124
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,672
I'm gonna put a serious case of crotch-rot
on that ugly face of yours, Junior.

125
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,220
Goddamn, man! You break your ass for
the white man! No justice around here!

126
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,723
What's O'Neill got?
A nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

127
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,476
How come
we always get fucking ambush?

128
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,563
Cos it's politics, man, politics.

129
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,316
Hey, Chris, I show you a picture
of Lucy Jean?

130
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,693
No, you didn't.

131
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,863
She's the one for me all right,
that Lucy Jean.

132
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,701
- She's waiting for me.
- Real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

133
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,162
- Hey, you got a picture of your girl?
- No.

134
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,915
I guess that leaves some unlucky girl
back at home, don't it?

135
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,043
Tuck this in.

136
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,713
Shitcan this.

137
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,175
Don't need this. Turn around.

138
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,221
Come on.

139
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,225
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here
on your position.

140
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,061
Goddamn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig!

141
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:17,357
I ain't getting greased, so you keep
this sorry cheese-dick off my ass!

142
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,527
You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me.

143
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,532
Look, case anything happens to you,
you get lost or separated,

144
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,326
don't yell out, OK?

145
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,078
- OK.
- Just sit tight and we'll get to you.

146
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,247
- All right.
- Yo!

147
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,999
Saddle up!

148
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,168
Lock and load!

149
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:42,508
* I come from Alabama
with my banjo on my knee

150
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,094
* And I'm going to Louisiana

151
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,765
* my true love for to see

152
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,602
* Oh, Susanna

153
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,689
* Don't you cry for me

154
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,778
* For I come from Alabama
with my banjo...

155
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,430
Mom and Dad didn't
want me to come here.

156
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,059
They wanted me to be like them:
respectable, hard-working,

157
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,228
a little house, a family.

158
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,606
They drove me crazy
with their goddamn world, Grandma.

159
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,817
You know Mom.

160
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,071
I guess I've always been
sheltered and special.

161
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,449
I just wanna be anonymous
like everybody else,

162
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,618
do my share for my country.

163
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,997
Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.

164
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,833
Well, here I am, anonymous,

165
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,502
with guys nobody really cares about.

166
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,963
Most come from the end ofthe line,

167
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,841
small towns you never heard of.

168
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,178
Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.

169
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,431
Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.

170
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,017
Two years' high school's about it.

171
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:19,646
If they're lucky, ajob waiting for them
back in a factory. Most have got nothing.

172
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,815
They're poor. They're the unwanted.

173
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,860
Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.

174
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:29,448
It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom
of the barrel, and they know it.

175
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,701
Maybe that's why
they call themselves 'grunts',

176
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,787
cos a grunt can take it,
can take anything.

177
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,583
They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.

178
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,671
Hey, Taylor...

179
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,132
Hey... cheese-dick, you're up.

180
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,301
- What?
- You're up.

181
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,805
Sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

182
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:54,932
I'm sure.

183
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,143
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

184
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,853
Three times. I got it.

185
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:08,612
Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?

186
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,489
OK.

187
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,711
Maybe I've finally found it
way down here in the mud.

188
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,172
Maybe from down here
I can start up again.

189
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,342
Be something I can be proud of
without having to fake it,

190
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,511
be a fake human being.

191
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,472
Maybe I can see something
I don't yet see, or...

192
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,100
learn something I don't yet know.

193
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,103
I miss you. I miss you very much.

194
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,314
Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.

195
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,709
Junior.

196
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,754
Junior... Hey.

197
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:14,720
- All right, motherfucker!
- It's your shift, man... OK?

198
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,600
Here, take this.

199
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:06,308
Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off, goddamn it!

200
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,397
Take the safety off!

201
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,244
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

202
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,587
Agh!

203
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,007
Aghhhhh! my fucking arm!

204
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,766
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

205
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,602
I can't even see!

206
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,568
- Doc, over here! Gardner's hit!
- Right there!

207
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,571
Oh, shit... I'm hit!

208
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,282
Taylor's hit!

209
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,243
Oh, shit!

210
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,872
- How bad is it?
- Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

211
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,041
Relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.

212
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,252
Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?

213
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,422
He let 'em walk right up on us!
He was sleeping on his shift!

214
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,382
No, I did not.

215
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,927
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.
Don't let him go into shock.

216
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,222
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!

217
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,349
Take the pain!

218
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,961
Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.

219
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,964
OK? Don't worry.

220
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,133
Big Harold,

221
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,844
do you know if...

222
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,013
if you're gonna die?

223
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:12,267
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

224
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,938
Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!
You're about to get outta here.

225
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:21,652
They're gonna give you three hot meals
a day... White sheets...

226
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,531
Them pretty white nurses'll give you
blow jobs if you pay 'em enough!

227
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,700
- I heard about them white bitches!
- Don't babytalk him!

228
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:33,205
The cocksucker fell asleep!
He let 'em walk up on us, didn't do shit!

229
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:35,374
Just shut up, Junior.

230
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,168
You relax, OK, man?

231
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,337
OK...

232
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,340
It's not so bad...

233
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,176
 Dying...

234
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,012
How long...

235
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,266
How long...

236
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,857
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there. You're gonna make it!

237
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,118
Come on, Gardner, hang in there.
You're gonna make it!

238
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,620
Come on...! Don't quit!

239
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,875
Come on, Gardner, help me!
Don't give up!

240
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,202
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

241
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,207
Remember what it looks like.

242
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:04,421
You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn
guarantee you a trip out of the bush,

243
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,673
in a body bag!

244
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,928
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

245
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,225
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains!

246
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,062
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

247
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,735
And the next sonofabitch I catch
copping Zs in the bush,

248
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,864
I'm personally gonna take
an interest in seeing him suffer.

249
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,700
I shit you not.

250
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,704
Doc... tag him and bag him!

251
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,708
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

252
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,711
- It was Junior...
- Shut your face, chicken-shit!

253
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,713
You in big trouble, boy!

254
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,883
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor -
everybody got one.

255
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,094
Knock it off!

256
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,223
We got two men need attention here.

257
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,604
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

258
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,524
Junior,

259
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,693
Tony,

260
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,862
carry Gardner.

261
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:16,243
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

262
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,897
Hey, Taylor, what's in the breeze?

263
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,900
OK. Got light duty. Three days' worth.

264
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,819
No shit!
Too bad we're in base camp, anyway.

265
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,988
- What you got? Beers?
- Yeah.

266
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:57,159
Stole me some from the Top's supply.
Shit, he been stealing it from us.

267
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,286
Hey, Taylor!

268
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,915
- Hey, are you back?
- Uh, yeah, it looks like it.

269
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,626
King, where did you get those beers, boy?

270
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,794
- I found it.
- Oh, you found it?

271
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,173
- You're going on report, son.
- Both of you, come with me.

272
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,342
I got a little job for you.

273
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:19,681
Goo-o-o-o-o-ood
morning, Vietnam! I'm Army...

274
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,850
motherfucker!

275
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,312
motherfucker!

276
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,441
I'm too short for this shit, man!

277
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,695
They're always fucking with us...
no let-up!

278
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,866
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

279
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:43,705
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio!

280
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,545
39 and a wake-up, a pause for the cause,
and I'm a gone motherfucker!

281
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,714
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

282
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,883
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit!

283
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,970
92 left to go. April 17.

284
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,306
DEROS, man. Home to California.

285
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:05,143
I'm gonna be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

286
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,647
The surfing's gonna be good!

287
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:10,816
march, man, in Tennessee.

288
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:15,696
Sniff the pines... sniff that
cross-mounted pussy down by the river!

289
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,865
Whooo, hot damn!

290
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:22,744
Hey, Taylor, how long have you got left?
300 and what?

291
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,913
32.

292
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,125
332 days.

293
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,377
Sin loi, my boy!

294
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:34,006
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man!

295
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,383
You gotta, like, count backwards.

296
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,929
You know, you got 40 days in.
I mean, think positive, dude.

297
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:44,725
Hey, Taylor,
how the fuck you get here, anyway?

298
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,686
- You look educated.
- I volunteered.

299
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,439
- You did what?!
- I volunteered. I...

300
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:55,068
dropped out of college, told 'em
I wanted the infantry, combat, Vietnam.

301
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,946
You volunteered for this shit, man?

302
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,324
Can you believe that?

303
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,577
You's a crazy fucker... giving up college.

304
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,955
Didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

305
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,000
I figured, why should
just the poor kids go off to war...

306
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,628
and the rich kids
always get away with it?

307
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,757
- What we got here is a crusader.
- Sounds like it.

308
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,383
Shit!

309
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,846
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

310
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,058
Everybody know...

311
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:32,189
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich. Always have, always will.

312
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,280
I tell you what - you be cool, I introduce
you round to some of the heads.

313
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:44,243
- What are the heads?
- Later, man!

314
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,709
What's up, brother?

315
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:01,093
Your Highness has arrived!
Hey, what's happening?

316
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,971
I thought you was hanging ten
in Cambodia!

317
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,224
- Hey, man, how ya doing?
- How ya doing, man?

318
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,393
All right!

319
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,691
What you doing in the underworld,
Taylor?

320
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:17,943
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot.

321
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,654
This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

322
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,039
Go ahead, Taylor.

323
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,750
- What?
- Are you lame or something?

324
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,088
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

325
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:50,475
Here!

326
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,562
Your shit's in the wind, troop! Baaa!

327
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,731
Baaaaaaaa!

328
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey, man, what's happening?

329
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:02,696
If you do that baaa, you'd better
do it right. Baaaaaa!

330
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,283
You're weird, man.

331
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,328
You're a child, Lerner.
I don't waste time on you.

332
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,758
- First time?
- Yeah.

333
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,013
Then the worm has definitely turned
for you, man.

334
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,475
Feel good?

335
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:35,354
Yeah, it feels good.
I got no pain in my neck now.

336
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,190
Feeling good's good enough.

337
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,036
Put your mouth on this.

338
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,395
Where the hell is everybody, man?
They getting high, that's what.

339
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,606
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special!

340
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:24,361
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

341
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:29,241
Redneck noise, dude, that's all it is.
make about as much sense as you do.

342
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,495
All them chucks be rappin'
about how they losing their ho,

343
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,540
saying how
they ain't got no bread for beer.

344
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:41,003
Fuck that honky shit!
Gimme some motown jams - dig it?

345
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,382
What are you talking shit for, man?

346
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,136
- Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude!

347
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:53,056
Y'all be trying to keep the black man
down and string him out on that shit.

348
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,977
The time be's coming, my man,
when the black man throw that yoke off.

349
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:00,105
Simple - free your mind,
your ass will follow.

350
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:04,401
I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit,
everything kinda gets weird.

351
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:08,655
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass?

352
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,200
So we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

353
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:14,661
Don't you worry, Bunny.
You's a killer anyway, man.

354
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,539
I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

355
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:21,043
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy,
'cept maybe the lndy 500.

356
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,755
Only way you'd get some pussy is
if a bitch dies and wills it to you...

357
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,715
and then... maybe!

358
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,429
How's it going, Bunny?

359
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,223
LT,

360
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,391
check it out.

361
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,770
Like that?

362
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,439
Terrific. I'll send it home.

363
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,317
Hey, Junior.

364
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,903
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

365
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,706
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

366
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,708
Thank you, sir.

367
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,877
You, uh, need anything?

368
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,629
No, sir.

369
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,675
This guy's easily three,
four times my size.

370
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:14,429
I got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He don't know whether to shit or go blind!

371
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:17,099
- Whaddaya say, LT?
- How ya doing, Red?

372
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:20,602
Not good. This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

373
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:23,981
- Full house.
- Look like you're doing all right!

374
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,817
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

375
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,444
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

376
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,947
Oh, thanks, Sandy.

377
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,449
Play, Lieutenant?

378
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:38,120
Nah. Wouldn't wanna get raped
by you guys.

379
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:42,916
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What are you saving up to be? Jewish?

380
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,461
Jewish!

381
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:53,677
I gotta run. I'll, uh, catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

382
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,811
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

383
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:09,151
What do you say there, Bob?
Guy like that make it? Yes or no?

384
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,319
Uh-huh.

385
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:13,322
Uh-huh. I have to tell you,
that's precisely what I saw.

386
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,491
Sometimes I just look at a guy...

387
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:18,160
and I know this fella's not gonna make it.

388
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,329
Just no fucking way.

389
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,666
Get it going now!

390
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,132
Ahhhhhhh-hooooo!

391
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,683
* People say I'm the life of the party

392
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,354
* Cos I tell a joke or two

393
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,982
* Although I might be laughing

394
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:52,361
* Loud and hearty

395
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:55,989
* Deep inside I'm blue

396
00:35:56,698 --> 00:36:01,161
* So take a good look at my face

397
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,705
* You see the smile

398
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,250
* Looks out of place

399
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,712
* If you look closer, it's easy to trace

400
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:14,550
* The tracks of my tears

401
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,218
Yeah!

402
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,429
* I need you
* Need you!

403
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,933
* Need you
* Need you!

404
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,020
New Year's Day, 1968.

405
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,232
Just another day. Staying alive.

406
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,569
There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.

407
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,863
Regiments of NVA moving across.

408
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,866
A lot of little firefights, ambushes.

409
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:43,704
We drop bombs, then we walk through
the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.

410
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,206
Psst!

411
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,750
Psst!

412
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,934
Bunker.

413
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,936
Where?

414
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:37,090
Roger. Bunkers
at point. Two actuals on the way.

415
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:24,471
Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised
there is a bunker complex up front.

416
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,307
We're on the way down. Over.

417
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,478
See you next week!

418
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,877
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank -
about 50 metres.

419
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,379
Washington, you cover this side.

420
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,133
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

421
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,302
Bummer!

422
00:39:55,437 --> 00:40:00,108
Oh, Christ, look at that, will ya? The
teapot's still boiling! They were just here!

423
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,531
Man, this is spooky, Sander.
Let's get outta here.

424
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,026
Watch it... watch it!

425
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,454
Look what we got, Sal.

426
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,623
We got maps,

427
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,627
we got... S...

428
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,296
man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get outta here!

429
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:47,257
No, Sal, this is important,
this is important.

430
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,680
Come on, let's leave! Let's go!

431
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,685
Booby trap! Get down!

432
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,108
medic!

433
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,863
Holy jeez!

434
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:26,505
Goddamn it!

435
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,427
We got... We got two men down, sir.

436
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,555
There was an explosion.

437
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:36,932
Listen, we need help, sir, ASAP.

438
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,352
move your ass outta here!
One round could get all you guys!

439
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:42,938
Rodriguez, move it! Junior, let's go!

440
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:47,818
Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

441
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:52,281
On their way. The NVA have been spotted
in the village half a klik down the river.

442
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:54,741
- Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
- OK.

443
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:59,413
Also, leave four of your men here,
and a medic, OK? move it out.

444
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:25,689
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

445
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,777
- Hey, where's manny?
- manny?

446
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,780
- Hey, Washington!
- manny?

447
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,410
- manny?
- Washington!

448
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,996
manny, where you at?

449
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,817
We had to get to the village
before dark,

450
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,070
so we left Elias with some men
to keep looking.

451
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,740
But it was King who found him,
about a thousand yards downriver,

452
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:18,909
not far from the village.

453
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:25,290
It was the end ofthe mystery.

454
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,032
The motherfuckers!

455
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:09,668
The village which had stood
for maybe 1,000 years...

456
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:12,296
didn't know we were coming that day.

457
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,464
If they had, they would've run.

458
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:19,428
Barnes was at the eye ofour rage
and, through him, our Captain Ahab.

459
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,638
He would set things right again.

460
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,807
That day we loved him.

461
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,021
Dung lai! Dung lai!

462
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,773
Let it go, Sarge!

463
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,032
- Check him out.
- Yeah, you got it, Sarge.

464
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,451
Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!

465
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,956
Get that stupid look off your face!

466

Hey, piggy, piggy! Hey, pig!

00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,553
Bunny, clear the hooches now!

00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,556

OK, watch your back!

00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:21,865
Let's go, Junior! Bring 'em in!
Get those people down here!

474
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:28,497
Get outta there, you fuckheads! move!

475
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:31,750
La Dai Moi!

476
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:47,850
Come on!

477
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,019
- Put 'em in the pig pen!
- Kill these!

478
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,692
Give me your willie pete!

479
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:00,028
Hey, shut up!

00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:02,322
Get back!

481
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,991
Fire in the hole!

482
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,549
Get 'em outta here!

483
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:22,718

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,562
Be cool. They're scared, man.

487
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,607
Oh, they're scared, huh?
What about me, man?

488
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:40,736
I'm sick of this fucking shit!
Come on, motherfucker! move!

489
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,905
Watch this fucker!

490
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:47,242
Who the fuck do you think

491
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:51,288
Hey! La Dai! La Dai!

Well, well. What have we here?

493
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:03,091
We got one, two, three, four mag 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

494
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:11,600
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

495
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:17,064
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

496
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,732
Tubbs, get outta there.

497
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,400
Junior, burn it.

498
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,445
What the fuck's the matter?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

499
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:25,823
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

500
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:29,660
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?!

501
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:32,579
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole!

502
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:37,459
Get the fuck up here! Come here,

503
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:40,254
Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?!

504
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,465
- Do 'em, man! Do 'em!
- What are you smiling at, huh?!

505
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,969
You want something to smile at?!
You want something to smile at?!

506
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:50,138
Motherfucker!

507
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,976
Come on, man! Do 'em!

508
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:58,105
Dance, one-legger! Dance! Dance!

00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:02,526

One-legged motherfucker!

00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,195

511
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,493
Hey, man, come on. Let's go, man.

512
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:20,335
Fucking pussy, man!
He's laughing at you!

513
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,504
That's the way the gook laughs.

514
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,631
Yeah, sure you are!

515
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,800
You're real sorry, ain't ya?

516
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:31,930
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal, and manny!

517
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,933
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

518
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,102
Whaddaya say?

519
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,777
Hah!

520
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:00,709
Holy shit! Did you see
that fucking head come apart, man?

521
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,297
I never seen brains like that before, man!

522
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:11,678
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show, man!

523
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:16,225
She probably cut manny's throat.
Probably cut my balls off if she could.

524
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:20,562
We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking
thing! You understand me, Taylor?

525
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:24,858
Come on, man, let's fucking do her!
Let's do this whole fucking village!

526
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:28,862
Look at the scars
on this gook honcho, Sarge.

527
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:33,075
Get out of here, Tubbs.

528
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:46,088
- Where'd he get these wounds?
- Ti sow boo coo teo?

530
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:52,594
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure!

531
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,723
Ask him why these weapons were here.

532
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,853
Ti sow con shienb dung owh da?

533
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,439
They had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no.

534
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,734
- All the rice is theirs.
- Oh, bullshit, Lerner!

535
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,363
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

536
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:16,034
I bie bung ow dung kiashung?

537
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,790
He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't
been around in a couple of months.

538
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:25,460
- maybe it was a scout or something.
- Yeah, sure, a scout!

539
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:29,256
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

540
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:34,428
That cocksucker knows
what I'm saying, don't you, pop?

541
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:36,889
- Goddamn right he does!
- U bec! U bec!

542
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:40,392
- He's lying through his teeth!
- Waste the fucker!

543
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,687
Where the hell's the VC?
Where the hell's the VC?

544
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:52,654
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but...

545
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,781
What's the bitch saying?

546
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,409
She's going on about
why we killed the pigs.

547
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:00,537
- They gotta make a living. All that shit.
- Oh, Jesus!

548
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,380
Shut up!

549
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,133
Shut the fuck up!

550
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:42,287
You tell him, he starts talking
or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!

551
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,997
Tell him, Lerner!

552
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,544
Noy di bung kum tung shi caca doi!

553
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,798
Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?

554
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,889
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

555
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,517
Come on!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

556
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:10,023
- Let's do 'em!
- Outta my way!

557
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:15,112
This is his daughter, right? Right?

558
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:27,666
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

559
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:31,461
I caca dao, Vee Cee!
I caca dao, Vee Cee!

560
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:35,007

561
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,426
Barnes!

562
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,513
Barnes!

563
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:48,228
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

564
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,526
Stay outta this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

565
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:57,863
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

566
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,117
- Get him, Barnes!
- Come on, Barnes! Come on, Barnes!

567
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:04,119
Get him!

568
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:06,413
Tear his fucking head off!

569
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:25,349
Break it up!

570
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,562
Break it up!

571
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,606
Goddamn!

572
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:36,902
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

573
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,988
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

574
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:43,242
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

575
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,410
Break it up! Shut up!

576
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,413
Break it up! Listen up!

577
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,750
Captain says to torch this place!

578
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,295
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place!

579
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:58,340
Round up all suspected VC
and shake it up!

580
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:01,176
- We ain't got much light left!
- Lieutenant...

581
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:04,972
- Why didn't you do something?
- What are you talking about?

582
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:07,724
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

583
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:13,021
No, I don't. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

584
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,986
All right, move it out! Let's go!

585
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:21,530
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

586
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:24,825
move it out! Police up the weapons,
and let's go!

587
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,322
Fire in the hole!

588
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,666
Fire in the hole!

589
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:02,214
Hey, hey, come on! morehouse!

590
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,467
You fucker! Get outta here!
Get the fuck off!

591
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:09,137
Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!

592
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:11,306
What is this, huh?!

593
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:19,898
- What, you a homosexual, Taylor?
- Taylor, she's a fucking dink!

594
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,609
She's a fucking human being, man!

595
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:26,196
- Fuck you!
- You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!

596
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:30,033
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

597
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,994
Fucking lame fuck!

598
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:35,080
You don't belong in Nam, man!
Ain't your place at all!

599
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,624
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

600
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,878
You just don't fucking get it.

601
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,505
It's OK.

602
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,094
Get outta there!

603
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:51,513
Fuck you, man.

604
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:55,225
Police up your dicks
and let's get outta here.

605
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,617
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

606
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:56,745
That dink was reported to me
as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

607
00:58:56,912 --> 00:59:00,582
my report will include Lieutenant Wolfe
as being witness to the shooting.

608
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,292
All right, Elias.

609
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,086
Staff Sergeant Barnes.

610
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:05,587
Sir!

611
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:08,757
I want a full report on this
when we get back to the CP.

612
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:13,387
You got it, dai wee, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

613
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,931
Not now, goddamn it, not now!

614
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:20,102
We'll get into this when we get back
to camp. I can promise you something.

615
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,896
If I find out there was an illegal killing,

616
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:25,107
there will be a court martial.

617
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:29,570
Right now I need every man in the field.
And you two will cease fire.

618
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,739
Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...

619
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,908
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:39,496
We're back in that NVA bunker complex
tomorrow. This time from the east.

621
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:44,251
You people get some rest and be back
here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.

622
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,961
Yes, sir.

623
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,676
Come on, man.

624
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:55,804
You think these chucks give a fuck
about you and me?

625
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:59,933
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.

626
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:05,814
And that Bunny? That motherfucker's
crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.

627
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,983
He just scares me.

628
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,445
You bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

629
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,364
These gooks are a lot smarter
than you think.

630
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,950
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.

631
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:20,787
They was NVA, every last one of 'em.

632
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:25,125
Now, he's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

633
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:29,505
A Christian don't go around a village
cutting off heads and shit.

634
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:33,342
This shit is really getting outta
hand, man. Way outta control.

635
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,720
Seems to me that you don't seem
to know the difference,

636
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:39,556
the way you shoot up that shit
all the time.

637
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:42,226
I don't know, brothers,

638
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,230
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

639
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:51,485
Don't worry about it.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

640
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:54,696
- He's a troublemaker.
- Elias is a water-walker.

641
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:58,242
Like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war...

642
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:01,078
with one hand tied around their balls.

643
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:04,164
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

644
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:08,001
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

645
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,129
How'd it go there, Bob?

646
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:16,718
Yeah, that-away, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

647
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:19,221
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

648
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,891
He's gonna get everybody
in this platoon in deep shit.

649
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:25,477
Somebody oughta frag his ass.

650
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:29,481
So whaddaya think, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

651
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:32,025
Bob?

652
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,903
O'Neill, man,
you worry too much.

653
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:37,030
Sarge'll take care of it.

654
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:44,997
It's a beautiful night.

655
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:48,250
Yeah. I love this place at night.

656
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,752
The stars...

657
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:55,215
There's no right or wrong in 'em.

658
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,092
They're just there.

659
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:59,261
That's a nice way of putting it.

660
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,185
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?

661
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,937
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

662
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:12,691
And you? Do you believe?

663
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,447
In '65... yeah.

664
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,075
Now,

665
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:25,746
no.

666
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:31,627
What happened today
is just the beginning.

667
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:35,380
We're gonna lose this war.

668
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,466
Come on!

669
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:40,719
You really think so? Us?

670
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:44,139
We've been kicking
other people's asses for so long,

671
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:46,809
I figure it's time we got ours kicked.

672
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,822
Day by day,
I struggle to maintain...

673
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:02,491
not only my strength, but my sanity.

674
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:05,828
It's all a blur. I have no energy to write.

675
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:10,082
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong any more.

676
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:14,002
The morale ofthe men is low.
There's civil war in the platoon.

677
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:16,672
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.

678
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:21,802
There's a lot of suspicion and hate.
I can't believe we're fighting each other...

679
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:24,179
when we should be fighting them.

680
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:30,102
Counting days, and the six inches
in front ofmy face. Not much else.

681
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:35,232
Hope things are well, Grandma.
Tell Mom and Dad l...

682
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:38,443
Well... just tell them. Chris.

683
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:04,511
Hey, big boy, I know you thought
you had that laundry gig all laid out.

684
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,016
I gotta paint myself white
just to get me one of them fucking jobs!

685
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:13,103
I got my request in for a circumcision!
I'm gonna get my big ass outta here!

686
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,272
You gonna become a rabbi?

687
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:17,441
Leech.

688
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:21,987
All right!

689
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,156
move it out!

690
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:30,162
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

691
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:31,788
Yeah, I hope so!

692
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,373
Let's go!

693
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:13,997
Doc! Get up here! Lerner's hit!

694
01:05:19,503 --> 01:05:21,505
Sergeant Warren's hit!

695
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:26,260
What the fuck's going on?

696
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:30,305
They got RPGs, man! lt's an ambush!
They were fucking waiting for us!

697
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,891
- Who's on point?!
- Lerner and Warren!

698
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:35,060
Taylor, where are you going?!

699
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:42,359
Goddamn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

700
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:44,987
Right!

701
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,830
Watch out! Rockets!

702
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:07,759
- Where the fuck's Lerner?!
- He's over there! By the log!

703
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:34,870
Fire mission! Grid 649402.

704
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,039
Direction, 610...

705
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:40,083
Adjust fire! Over!

706
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:45,172
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

707
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:49,468
Let me get some men and roll up
that flank. I can work right up on them!

708
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:54,014
Get me Barnes! Elias, we got four down
up there! What do you want me to do?

709
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:57,226
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?!

710
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,603
Tell those assholes to get up here!

711
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:04,066
- Elias, what the fuck are you...!
- Listen, Barnes, there's holes here.

712
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:07,110
Third Platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

713
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:11,448
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in the crossfire.

714
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:13,659
Sounds pretty far out to me, Elias.

715
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:17,079
I've seen it happen - Ia Drang in '66.

716
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,915
They cut us to fucking pieces!
I need three men!

717
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,044
- OK, you got 'em. Take off.
- Keep pouring off that cover fire.

718
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:27,923
I don't want to be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze!

719
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:32,052
Hey, you don't tell me
how to run my war, Elias!

720
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,764
You go crying and rat-fucking
to brigade on your own time!

721
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:39,017
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

722
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,811
You're an asshole, Barnes!

723
01:07:40,978 --> 01:07:43,438
Sir, get that asshole O'Neill up here!

724
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,942
Two Charlie, this is two! Be advised...!

725
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:26,148
Stay down!

726
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,039
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

727
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:58,347
Sarge! Short round!

728
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,521
Oh, God!

729
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,148
Aghhhh! Get it off!

730
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,444
Oh, God! Oh, God!

731
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,449
Aghhh! Aghhh! Jesus!

732
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,045
medic!

733
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,389
Satchel charge!

734
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:45,811
Doc!

735
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:48,730
Doc, help me out!

736
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,072
You OK?

737
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:00,576
- Don't leave me, man.
- All right.

738
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:05,038
- Hey, Gator... you'll be OK, man.
- Don't leave me, man.

739
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,958
Gator, hang tough. You'll be OK.

740
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,127
Drop your rucks.

741
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:12,588
Taylor, you're coming with us.

742
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:15,465
Please don't go! Don't!

743
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:17,301
You're gonna be OK.

744
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,305
- Come on!
- Doc! Take care of him, man.

745
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:27,102
Redleg! Redleg!
Ripper Bravo Two actual!

746
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:29,229
Adjustment follows!

747
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:36,236
You ignorant asshole! What the fuck
coordinates are you giving?!

748
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:40,491
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

749
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,659
You know that?!

750
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:45,662
You know that?! Ah, shit!

751
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:50,834
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo Two!

752
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:53,921
Check your fire! Check your fire!

753
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:06,433
They're coming.

754
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,438
Stagger yourself across this line.

755
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:13,607
Shoot anything that moves.

756
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:16,485
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

757
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,822
Any one of 'em gets through,
we're truly fucked.

758
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,825
Where the hell are you going?

759
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:26,119
Down by the river,
about 100 metres,

760
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,288
in case they try to flank us.

761
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:31,166
Third Platoon's coming up to our rear,
so watch for 'em.

762
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,210
Can I go with you?

763
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,003
No.

764
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,172
I move faster alone.

765
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:47,641
Come here. Let's let arty
do a little bit of the work here.

766
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:50,853
You tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

767
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,856
We link up with Third Platoon.
You got that?

768
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:57,860
What about Elias?
lf we pull back, he'll be cut off.

769
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:01,029
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant!

770
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,657
I'll get him.

771
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:46,241
- I got two of them fuckers, man!
- I got one!

772
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:49,077
Ho Chi minh sucks dead dicks!

773
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,707
Crawford!

774
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:56,251
Oh, man!

775
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:59,671
Kiss my ass, man!
I never thought I'd get hit!

776
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:03,550
It's a lung, babe.
You got two of them fuckers.

777
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:08,096
Sarge, a bunch of gooks came through
there. We got three of the fuckers!

778
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:11,016
Did you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

779
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:13,268
Get the fuck back to church.

780
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:17,439
- Elias is still out there, Sarge!
- Taylor, I'll get him!

781
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:21,777
You get Crawford in. Now! Before you
Article 15 both your asses! move!

782
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,946
move it!

783
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:53,827
Aghhhhhhh!

784
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,270
We still got ya.

785
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:23,690
- Come on, brother.
- medic, where the fuck are you!

786
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:27,528
You're gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

787
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,491
Taylor, where are you going?

788
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:46,064
Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.

789
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:48,817
- Get going.
- He's dead?

790
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:51,945
Yeah. He's back there about 100 metres.

791
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,947
You saw him? Where?

792
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:58,202
He's dead! There's gooks all over
the goddamn place! Get moving!

793
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:15,052
Let's go, let's go, let's go! move it!

794
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:54,591
Let's go! move it, move it!
OK, let's go!

795
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:22,035
You OK, Harold?
You're on the next one. You're OK, bud.

796
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:09,625
Oh, fuck!

797
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,505
They've got Elias!

798
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:15,631
What?

799
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:24,556
Back down! Back down there!

800
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:35,275
Snake One-Nine, Fly Four.
There's still one ofthe men down there.

801
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:01,927
Hold your armour!
Guns, guns, pull up, pull up!

802
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,513
We're trying to cover it on my side.

803
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:05,240
He killed him. I know that he killed him.
I saw his eyes when he came back in.

804
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:09,745
How do you know the dinks didn't
get him? You got no proof, man.

805
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:14,500
The proof's in the eyes, man. You were
there. I know what you were thinking.

806
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,668
I say we frag that fucker tonight!

807
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:18,921
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

808
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:22,257
I say let military justice do the job on him.

809
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:26,261
Fuck the military justice!
Are you joking me?

810
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:30,516
Who do you think they'll believe?
O'Neill? Bunny? Wolfe? Bullshit!

811
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:32,684
Shit, man, you try that,

812
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,687
Barnes'll shove it up your ass
with a candle on it!

813
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:37,689
What do you suggest we do, huh?

814
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:40,108
I suggest you all watch your own asses!

815
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:42,945
Barnes is gonna
be coming down on all of 'em!

816
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:46,532
You gonna forget about Elias and all
the good times we done had in here?

817
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,785
You're trying to cure the headache
by cutting off the head.

818
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:54,581
Elias didn't ask you to fight
his battles for him.

819
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:58,585
And if there's a heaven
- and, God, I hope there is -

820
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:04,133
l know he's sitting up there drunk as
a fucking monkey, and smoking shit,

821
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:06,593
cos he done left his pains down here.

822
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:10,973
You're wrong, man! Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer!

823
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,225
Taylor...

824
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:17,980
I remember when you first came in here,
telling me how you admired the bastard!

825
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:19,648
- I was wrong.
- Wrong?

826
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:22,526
You ain't never been right...
about nothing!

827
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:26,530
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good!

828
01:22:27,156 --> 01:22:30,117
Barnes has been shot seven times,
and he ain't dead!

829
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,995
Does that mean anything to you, huh?

830
01:22:33,162 --> 01:22:35,164
Barnes ain't meant to die!

831
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:39,501
The only thing
that could kill Barnes... is Barnes.

832
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,629
Talking about killing?

833
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:52,055
Hmm?

834
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,852
You all experts?

835
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:00,689
You all know about killing?

836
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:04,193
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

837
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:14,870
You smoking this shit
so as to escape from reality?

838
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:19,750
me, I don't need this shit.

839
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:28,008
I am reality.

840
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:38,352
There's the way it ought to be,
and there's the way it is.

841
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:44,233
Elias was full of shit.

842
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,070
Elias was a crusader.

843
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:53,283
Now, I got no fight with any man
who does what he's told,

844
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:57,037
but when he don't...
the machine breaks down.

845
01:23:58,121 --> 01:24:02,417
And when the machine breaks down
we break down.

846
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,129
And I ain't gonna allow that...

847
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:08,465
from any of you.

848
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:10,759
Not one.

849
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,902
You all love Elias.

850
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,784
You wanna kick ass.

851
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:39,788
Yeah...

852
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:45,294
Well, here I am, all by my lonesome.

853
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:51,550
And there ain't nobody gonna know.

854
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:58,765
Six of you boys against me.

855
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:06,940
Kill me.

856
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,627
I shit on all of you!

857
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:30,506
You motherfucker!

858
01:25:37,596 --> 01:25:39,681
- Come on, man, get him!
- Oh, fuck!

859
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,850
Get him, Chris!

860
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:47,940
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

861
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,858
You'll go dinky dow in LBJ.

862
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,444
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.

863
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:55,864
Ten years climbing
the fucking walls, man!

864
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,993
Don't do it!

865
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,005
Agh!

866
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:14,174
Agh!

867
01:26:18,137 --> 01:26:20,139
Death?

868
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:22,850
What do you all know about death?

869
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:40,367
They sent us back into the valley the next day...

870
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:43,579
about 2000 metres from Cambodia,
into a battalion perimeter.

871
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:47,207
It felt like we were returning
to the scene ofa crime.

872
01:27:21,492 --> 01:27:24,661
Alpha Company had been hit hard
by a sizeable force...

873
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:28,123
and Charlie Company
had been probed that night.

874
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:30,959
There were other battalions
in the valley,

875
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:33,921
but we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.

876
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:38,467
Somewhere out there
was the entire 141st NVA Regiment.

877
01:27:56,944 --> 01:28:01,281
Caught those motherfuckers trying to
pull some shit on Charlie Company.

878
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:03,450
They found maps on 'em, man.

879
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:08,205
A friend at Battalion says they had
every fucking foxhole fixed on it.

880
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:12,459
Distances... tree lines... our claymores...

881
01:28:12,626 --> 01:28:17,631
- Everything.
- This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

882
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:20,300
I also heard
we're in fucking Cambodia now.

883
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:23,178
Cambodia? man, you kidding me!

884
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,305
You wanted to see me, sir?

885
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,310
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like
you got Elias's squad now.

886
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:34,773
I didn't know we were still referring to
this platoon in terms of squads.

887
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:39,486
All right, look... I want you to take
those two holes there and there.

888
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:42,573
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

889
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:46,827
Begging your pardon, sir...
my two holes are far enough apart...

890
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:49,705
you could run a regiment through
and never see 'em.

891
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,832
I got five live bodies left, sir.

892
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:55,252
I don't wanna hear your problems.
You'll get new men any day.

893
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:58,672
- make do like everybody else.
- I didn't ask for this job.

894
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:01,258
- I don't wanna hear it.
- You don't wanna hear it?

895
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:06,680
That's right. I don't wanna hear it cos, to
tell you the truth, I don't give a shit, OK?

896
01:29:06,847 --> 01:29:08,849
I don't give a flying fuck any more.

897
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:11,018
Right.

898
01:29:16,565 --> 01:29:18,984
I'm glad I ain't going with 'em.

899
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:24,907
Somewhere out there's the beast,
and he hungry tonight.

900
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:27,075
What a fuckin' bummer!

901
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:31,079
Ten days and a wake-up
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

902
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,960
What's the matter with you, man?

903
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:39,338
How come you ain't writing nobody?

904
01:29:39,505 --> 01:29:44,551
What about your folks? That grandma
you was telling me about?

905
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:48,138
Girl?

906
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:55,270
Got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

907
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:57,439
Nah, there's nobody.

908
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:01,944
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

909
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:05,948
Gotta control that - bring a man down.

910
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:12,287
I remember when you first come out here
to the bush. You was green as a...

911
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:16,625
Ever get caught in a mistake that
you just can't get out of, King?

912
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:19,002
There's a way out of anything, man.

913
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:22,339
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry...

914
01:30:22,506 --> 01:30:24,508
and the worm will turn.

915
01:30:27,803 --> 01:30:30,097
How many days are you short?

916
01:30:30,264 --> 01:30:32,057
Nah, it's not just me.

917
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:36,395
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

918
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:40,566
People like Barnes go on making up
the rules any way they want.

919
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:43,777
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

920
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:47,614
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.

921
01:30:47,781 --> 01:30:49,783
Whoever said we did, man?

922
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,744
All you got to do is make it outta here...

923
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:57,207
and it's all gravy. Every day,
the rest of your life - gravy!

924
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:02,212
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

925
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:07,009
Hey, King, collect up your shit.
Your order's just come through.

926
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:11,513
- Don't fuck with me.
- What, you need a written invitation?

927
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,642
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!
The lifers have made a mistake!

928
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:18,145
They cut me some slack, Taylor!

929
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:22,399
Get your pig to Rodriguez. You got ten
minutes to make the last chopper out.

930
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:25,319
If you're not on it... I'm gonna be.

931
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,947
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

932
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:33,160
Great, King. I'm happy for you, man.
You take it on home for me, OK?

933
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:36,121
You got my address.
You know where to get hold of me.

934
01:31:36,288 --> 01:31:40,125
I gotta di-di, man.
I don't wanna miss that chopper.

935
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:46,590
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

936
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:48,550
Remember now, take it easy.

937
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:51,553
Don't think too much,
and don't you be no fool.

938
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,808
Ain't no such thing as a coward
out here. It don't mean nothing.

939
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:57,976
my man!

940
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:06,610
I'll walk you out, man.

941
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:13,158
Take it easy, King.

942
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:15,619
I'll take it any way I can get it, brother!

943
01:32:15,786 --> 01:32:16,870
Later!

944
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:20,165
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge.
No, man, don't touch this!

945
01:32:20,249 --> 01:32:22,584
I gotta get on that chopper, man!

946
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:25,629
- So what's the problem?
- Says he can't walk.

947
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:27,589
Shit...!

948
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,301
martin... get your boots on.

949
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:39,601
Next time I catch you spraying
'skeeter repellant on your fucking feet,

950
01:32:39,768 --> 01:32:42,688
I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.

951
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:45,315
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

952
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:48,152
Bust my ass!
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

953
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:50,279
Do your fucking worst!

954
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:53,782
You white folks have got
your last klik outta Junior!

955
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:57,369
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

956
01:32:57,536 --> 01:32:59,621
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

957
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:04,626
That... Iong, hairy, red and black
bastard I found in the ammo crate.

958
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:08,380
I'll put it in his crotch, see if he can walk.

959
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:09,631
I remember now.

960
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:14,720
Hey! Now, hold up, man! You just hold up!
Wait, all right?

961
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:17,931
Fuck it, I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

962
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,851
Fucking pussy!
Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

963
01:33:21,018 --> 01:33:22,519
Yeah.

964
01:33:22,686 --> 01:33:25,355
Uh, Bob? I'd like to speak to you a minute.

965
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:31,820
I can't take it no more!

966
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:36,492
- I'd like to speak to you. Bob...
- Yeah, what is it?

967
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:40,245
Bob, I got Elias's R and R.
It's coming up in three days.

968
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:43,332
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii to see Patsy.

969
01:33:43,499 --> 01:33:46,210
Hey, Bob, I never asked you
for a fucking thing.

970
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:50,214
To be honest, I hoped you'd put me
on that chopper with King.

971
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:54,051
- Whaddaya say, chief-a-rooney?
- I can't do that for you, Red.

972
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:57,346
We need every swinging dick
in the field. You know that.

973
01:33:57,513 --> 01:34:00,808
Talk to me! All I'm asking you for
is three fucking days here!

974
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:03,519
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you no.

975
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:07,189
- Get back in your foxhole!
- Bob,

976
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:10,025
l got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

977
01:34:10,859 --> 01:34:12,861
I mean, I got a bad feeling.

978
01:34:13,821 --> 01:34:16,198
I don't think I'm gonna make it outta here.

979
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:18,826
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

980
01:34:19,368 --> 01:34:22,204
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

981
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,339
Oh... shit!

982
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:48,397
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

983
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:02,870
There goes a fucking ambush.

984
01:35:02,911 --> 01:35:05,205
They ain't even waiting till later.

985
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:07,791
It's fucking coming now, man.

986
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,752
Right fucking now.

987
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,635
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man,

988
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:21,722
I don't feel like we done
something wrong.

989
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:23,891
Sometimes, man,

990
01:35:25,601 --> 01:35:27,603
I get this bad feeling.

991
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:33,442
I told the padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

992
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:36,612
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

993
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:38,989
The only worry you got is dying.

994
01:35:39,156 --> 01:35:44,077
If that happens, you won't know about
it anyway. So what the fuck, man?

995
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:47,331
Shit! I gotta be in this hole with you, man?

996
01:35:48,165 --> 01:35:50,792
I just know I shouldn't have come.

997
01:35:52,586 --> 01:35:56,965
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging
with Audie murphy here, my man!

998
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:02,012
Bravo Three, Bravo Six.
Send me a grid. Over.

999
01:36:02,179 --> 01:36:05,766
I can't, sir! We're pinned down!
They're in the fucking trees!

1000
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:10,646
Calm down, son. I'll get you a fire
mission ASAP. Smoke'll be first.

1001
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:14,650
Lieutenant's dead, radio man's dead.
I don't know where the map is.

1002
01:36:14,817 --> 01:36:18,695
They're all around us - hundreds!
I can hear 'em talking gook.

1003
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:23,784
OK, now spot that smoke and tell me
where to shift. Calm down, son.

1004
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:27,162
We'll get you out.
Tell me where the rounds hit. Over.

1005
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:48,600
Three Alpha Six, how about those rounds,
son? Can you adjust fire? Over.

1006
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,859
Three Alpha Six, if you can't talk, son,
just key your handset twice. Over.

1007
01:37:10,706 --> 01:37:13,208
Shit!

1008
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:00,005
Trip flare - Rodriguez's hole!

1009
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:06,678
RPG!

1010
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:10,849
Doc!

1011
01:38:11,016 --> 01:38:13,769
- Taylor! Francis!
- Over here, man!

1012
01:38:13,936 --> 01:38:18,398
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

1013
01:38:18,565 --> 01:38:21,527
Here it is, man. We got gooks
in the fucking perimeter!

1014
01:38:21,693 --> 01:38:23,529
Ah, shit, that's it!

1015
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:28,283
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, OK?

1016
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:32,996
Fuck! Two! Air strikes coming in -
they'll be laying snake and nape.

1017
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:37,918
Don't get outta your fucking holes.
Stay right here, man. Fuck!

1018
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:47,386
They're probing. They'll search this
line all night trying to get through.

1019
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:50,889
All right, stay here, stay cool.
I'll be right back.

1020
01:39:10,492 --> 01:39:12,452
Who is it?!

1021
01:39:14,621 --> 01:39:16,623
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1022
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:25,549
It's the ambush! Over here, man, hurry!

1023
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:31,513
- Oh, shit!
- Water!

1024
01:39:31,638 --> 01:39:35,058
They're all over the place!
Hundreds of 'em - moving this way!

1025
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:40,397
They wiped us out, man! We didn't
have a chance! Where's the CP?!

1026
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:42,774
- Back there!
- You guys get outta here!

1027
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:46,904
They're right on my ass!
They ain't stopping for shit!

1028
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:49,907
Hey, Taylor, man, let's di-di.

1029
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:52,826
You go.

1030
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:03,086
There!

1031
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:39,873
No, hold it, hold it!

1032
01:40:55,722 --> 01:40:58,851
Out of the hole! Fast!

1033
01:41:01,145 --> 01:41:04,064
Get outta the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1034
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:06,900
Let's go, let's go!

1035
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:09,695
Francis, move your fucking ass!
They're gonna...

1036
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:31,425
Follow me.

1037
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:33,677
What is it?!

1038
01:41:47,566 --> 01:41:49,776
Die, you motherfuckers!

1039
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:04,291
It's fucking beautiful!

1040
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:06,460
Aghhhh! Let's fucking do it!

1041
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:17,971
Come on, motherfuckers!

1042
01:42:22,476 --> 01:42:24,603
Come on! You can do better than that!

1043
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:27,731
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1044
01:42:30,484 --> 01:42:33,153
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1045
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:34,673
- Get me Bravo!
- Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand.

1046
01:43:34,798 --> 01:43:36,925
Three holes down. They need help.

1047
01:43:37,092 --> 01:43:39,595
OK, get two squads from Alpha
down there! Go!

1048
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,763
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1049
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:46,768
Hey, you people!
Where the fuck are you going?

1050
01:43:54,485 --> 01:43:55,694
Sir!

1051
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:09,458
- Can't you get anybody?!
- Negative contact! I can't raise Barnes!

1052
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:11,627
- Nothing!
- Get me Six!

1053
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:14,546
- Bravo Six, Bravo Six!
- It's Doc!

1054
01:44:14,713 --> 01:44:17,549
- Get him in!
- Come on!

1055
01:44:19,009 --> 01:44:22,888
They're coming through our line!
I can't do anything!

1056
01:44:23,055 --> 01:44:26,308
- Where's Barnes?
- Dead! I think they're all dead!

1057
01:44:26,475 --> 01:44:29,812
- Give it up, Doc! He's dead!
- Six, LT! Six!

1058
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:33,649
Captain, we've been overrun!
We're pulling back! Over!

1059
01:44:33,816 --> 01:44:36,652
Goddamn it!
Where are you gonna pull back to?!

1060
01:44:36,819 --> 01:44:38,862
They're all over the perimeter!

1061
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:42,699
You be advised, you will hold
in place and you will fight!

1062
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:45,744
That means you, Lieutenant!
Bravo Six out.

1063
01:45:15,858 --> 01:45:18,527
Be advised,
we got zips in the wire down here.

1064
01:45:18,694 --> 01:45:21,446
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.

1065
01:45:21,613 --> 01:45:24,783
We're hot to trot and packing snake
and nape, but we're bingo on fuel.

1066
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:30,372
For the record, it's my call! Dump
everything you've got left on my pos!

1067
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:34,710
I say again, expend all remaining
in my perimeter!

1068
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:38,380
It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.

1069
01:45:40,507 --> 01:45:43,927
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.

1070
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:47,222
Get 'em in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.

1071
01:45:47,389 --> 01:45:49,725
We are coming cocked for treetops.

1072
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:15,209
Barnes!

1073
01:46:17,878 --> 01:46:19,630
Barnes!

1074
01:46:22,925 --> 01:46:24,301
No...!

1075
01:49:14,847 --> 01:49:16,849
Get me a medic.

1076
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:20,769
Go on, boy!

1077
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:40,456
Do it.

1078
01:50:11,612 --> 01:50:15,073
Look out, mad Dog!
We got live gooks at three o'clock!

1079
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,659
What's down here? Let's go!

1080
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:22,956
Come on, Elmo!
move your flea-bitten ass!

1081
01:50:25,959 --> 01:50:27,961
Hey... you OK?

1082
01:50:28,879 --> 01:50:31,965
You all right? Can you walk? Huh?

1083
01:50:32,758 --> 01:50:35,886
Hey, Doc!
We need a medic up here!

1084
01:50:36,637 --> 01:50:39,807
- Come on, Elmo.
- Come on, Doc! We got wounded here!

1085
01:50:58,909 --> 01:51:01,662
Hey, that must've been
some fucking fight.

1086
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:04,498
You alone here, man?

1087
01:51:05,374 --> 01:51:06,667
Yeah.

1088
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:10,087
The bunch of fucking faggots,
they all left me!

1089
01:51:58,385 --> 01:52:02,681
122 wounded
and still counting.

1090
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:06,143
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1091
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:08,729
122 and still counting. Over.

1092
01:52:16,195 --> 01:52:17,362
Hey, Taylor!

1093
01:52:18,113 --> 01:52:20,407
- Hey, Francis.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

1094
01:52:20,574 --> 01:52:22,326
I'm OK. How are you doing?

1095
01:52:22,493 --> 01:52:24,495
Just fine, man! Hey, dig it!

1096
01:52:24,661 --> 01:52:27,372
We two-timers, man.
We gonna get outta here, boy!

1097
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:31,376
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high! Yes, sir!

1098
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:33,545
Sergeant O'Neill!

1099
01:52:34,546 --> 01:52:36,673
- How are you doing?
- Just fine, sir.

1100
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,051
That's good, cos you got second platoon.

1101
01:52:40,427 --> 01:52:42,221
Yes, sir.

1102
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,524
- Ready?
- You bet.

1103
01:54:22,905 --> 01:54:26,408
I think now, looking back,

1104
01:54:26,575 --> 01:54:30,412
we did not fight the enemy,
we fought ourselves,

1105
01:54:30,579 --> 01:54:33,499
and the enemy... was in us.

1106
01:54:35,167 --> 01:54:37,294
The war is over for me now,

1107
01:54:37,544 --> 01:54:42,299
but it will always be there,
for the rest ofmy days,

1108
01:54:42,466 --> 01:54:44,218
as I'm sure Elias will be,

1109
01:54:44,384 --> 01:54:47,805
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession ofmy soul.

1110
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:51,892
There are times since...

1111
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:55,521
I've felt like the child
born ofthose two fathers.

1112
01:54:58,565 --> 01:55:02,277
But be that as it may,
those ofus who did make it...

1113
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:05,531
have an obligation to build again,

1114
01:55:05,697 --> 01:55:08,367
to teach to others what we know,

1115
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:11,829
and to try with what's left ofour lives...

1116
01:55:11,995 --> 01:55:15,457
to find a goodness,
and meaning, to this life.
