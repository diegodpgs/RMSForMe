1
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,802
<i>One small fact.</i>

2
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,221
<i>You are going to die.</i>

3
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:57,225
<i>Despite every effort,
no one lives forever.</i>

4
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,982
<i>Sorry to be such a spoiler.</i>

5
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:08,653
<i>My advice is, when the
time comes, don't panic.</i>

6
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,947
<i>It doesn't seem to help.</i>

7
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,216
<i>I guess I should
introduce myself properly.</i>

8
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:33,219
<i>But then again,
you'll meet me soon enough.</i>

9
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,888
<i>Not before your time, of course.</i>

10
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>I make it a policy
to avoid the living.</i>

11
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,701
<i>Well, except sometimes.</i>

12
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,163
<i>Once in a very long time...</i>

13
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,499
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

14
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,185
<i>I get interested.</i>

15
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:21,434
<i>I don't know exactly what it
was about Liesel Meminger.</i>

16
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,565
<i>But she caught me.</i>

17
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,737
Mama.

18
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,408
<i>And I cared.</i>

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,425
Do you want to say a few words?

20
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,851
Goodbye my darling

21
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:10,001
She would have kept you
if she could have.

22
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,337
You know that, don't you?

23
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,862
Here we are. Come, Liesel.

24
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,365
Meet your new parents.

25
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,243
Come.

26
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,205
Hans Hubermann.

27
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,456
Heinrich.

28
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,584
Heinrich.

29
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,523
Where is the boy?

30
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,525
He died.

31
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,485
What do you mean?

32
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,904
On the way here.

33
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,823
They had to bury
him by the tracks.

34
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,659
They promised us two children,
with two allowances.

35
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,911
Rosa, you cannot
blame the boy for dying.

36
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,204
No, I blame his mother.

37
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,706
Dragging them across the
country unfed, unwashed!

38
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,266
She was running for her life.

39
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,417
Have you seen that girl?

40
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,294
Filthy.

41
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,773
Everything they say about communists
is true. Dirty and stupid.

42
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,259
I'll speak as loud as I want.

43
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:45,930
Come.

44
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,600
Come!

45
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,727
What is the matter with her?

46
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,609
Your Majesty.

47
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,788
What are you brats looking at?

48
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,878
This is Heaven Street,
your new home.

49
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,923
Hey, lover boy! Can we get
on with the game now?

50
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,805
Please, go in.

51
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,787
Well, go on.

52
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,458
What do you say?

53
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,339
They have given us a mute.

54
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,926
Go upstairs.

55
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,861
Where is it?

56
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,157
That one.

57
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,834
It's for you.

58
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,192
Hans!

59
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,969
<i>Ja,</i> my sunshine?

60
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,946
Good morning, Your Majesty.

61
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,539
Would you stop that racket?

62
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,092
What do you say?

63
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,511
Thank you.

64
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,763
It speaks?

65
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,893
Now, listen, from now on
you call me "Mama," <i>ja?</i>

66
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,979
Say it.

67
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,981
Mama.

68
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,191
Good.

69
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:30,529
And that <i>Saukerl,</i>
that lazy pig over there...

70
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,991
you call him "Papa."
Understood?

71
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,242
Papa.

72
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,332
Who is that?

73
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,875
Who is it?

74
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,628
Rudy Steiner, <i>Frau</i> Hubermann.

75
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,004
What do you want?

76
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,174
My mother says
you've got a daughter now.

77
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,009
What's it to you?

78
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,179
I'm here to take her to school.

79
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,890
Why can't people ever
mind their own business?

80
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,159
Hello, Rudy.

81
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,268
Hello!

82
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,358
And what makes you think you are
good enough for my daughter?

83
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,526
Rudy.

84
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,529
I'm almost 12.

85
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,783
Liesel, eat your soup
and go and get dressed.

86
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,702
Stay outside,
you filthy <i>Saukerl.</i>

87
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,124
Hurry up, Liesel.

88
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,839
Do you like to run?

89
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,885
I bet I could beat you.

90
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,721
No one has ever
beaten me in a race.

91
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,979
You don't say much, do you?

92
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,735
Is that one spit, "Yes,"
and two spits, "No"?

93
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,407
I'm glad we
understand each other.

94
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,453
My mother didn't really tell
me to come and get you.

95
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,417
I just thought
you might need a friend.

96
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,762
<i>Danke schön!</i>
Rudy!

97
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,183
What are you up to?

98
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,642
Nothing, Papa.

99
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,102
Then get to school.

100
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,204
Come on.

101
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,339
You are?

102
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,427
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann's new daughter.

103
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,763
I was not
addressing you, Steiner.

104
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,266
Girl, speak.

105
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,561
Liesel Meminger.

106
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,814
Chalk, board, name.

107
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,987
Come, girl.
We don't have all day.

108
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,078
Write it.

109
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,048
Silence.

110
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,346
Silence!

111
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,224
Back to your seat, now.

112
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,730
Silence.

113
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,697
<i>Dummkopf!
Dummkopf! Dummkopf!</i>

114
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:08,163
Hey, <i>Dummkopf.</i>
Can't you even read yet?

115
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,041
Go on. Read one word.
Read something.

116
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,376
<i>Dummkopf.</i>

117
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,059
She's killing him!

118
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,660
I bet that wasn't
your first fight.

119
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,496
Franz Deutscher hasn't
been hit like that...

120
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,249
since he peed in
Tommy Müller's lunchbox.

121
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,294
Franz Deutscher
doesn't sound very smart.

122
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,588
He's the dumbest kid in school.

123
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,340
But he shaves.

124
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,926
You remember how to get home?

125
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,929
Just because I can't read
doesn't make me stupid.

126
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,307
All right.
I'll follow you, then.

127
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,480
You could join our
soccer team, you know?

128
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,734
Look, you should probably just
stop trying to be my friend...

129
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,861
because I won't be
here long enough.

130
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,279
Why not?

131
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,282
I'm running away.
That's why not.

132
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,742
Where to?

133
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,660
None of your business.

134
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,414
Well, let me know when.

135
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,749
Why?

136
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,210
So I can come with you.

137
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,588
You don't understand.
I'm serious.

138
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,298
I have to find my mother.

139
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,549
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann?

140
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,778
<i>Nein, Dummkopf.</i>
My real mother.

141
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:46,804
Great.

142
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,972
I'd like to meet her.

143
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,768
What are you doing now?

144
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,019
Racing you.

145
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,689
I'll bet you
a kiss I can beat you.

146
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,600
Why would I want to kiss you?

147
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,861
I don't know.
What does that matter?

148
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm the one who's going to win.

149
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,658
Just to the end of the street.

150
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,120
And what if I win?

151
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,996
You don't have to kiss me.

152
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,581
Ever?

153
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,793
What do you care?

154
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,379
You're not
sticking around, right?

155
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,258
Hey! <i>Saumensch!</i>

156
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:48,866
You cheated.

157
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,451
So what?

158
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,455
I beat you.
Did not.

159
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,165
It was a draw.

160
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,126
Draw means I get the kiss.

161
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,711
You can stick your kiss.

162
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,088
Oh, my God.

163
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,257
She's going to kill you.

164
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,302
Who?

165
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,894
If you think that I am
some kind of pushover...

166
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,062
you are very much mistaken.

167
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,606
Do you hear?

168
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,947
I have just come
to say good night.

169
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,955
What is this?

170
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,082
Is it yours?

171
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,803
Why would a nice girl like you
want to read such a thing?

172
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,603
Are you sure this is yours?

173
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,272
It wasn't always mine.

174
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,984
It belonged to my brother.

175
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,194
I see.

176
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,279
Your brother...

177
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,449
his name was Pieter Strauss?

178
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,335
Do you know what this says?

179
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,701
Do you want to know
what it says?

180
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,642
I'm not such a good
reader myself, you know.

181
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,645
We will have to
help each other out.

182
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,647
<i>Ja?</i>

183
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,026
We better get started.

184
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:53,031
<i>"The Gravedigger's Handbook."</i>

185
00:17:55,284 --> 00:18:02,833
Raise the red flags
for German effort

186
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:08,422
we want to pave
the way to freedom

187
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,801
For German effort

188
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:18,515
we want to pave
the way to freedom

189
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,686
We do not create a brother pact

190
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,565
with Jews or non-Germanics

191
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:31,028
Because they falsify
the liberty certificate

192
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:36,950
of Germany's people

193
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,871
Walter.

194
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,290
Listen, he told me
he can only take one.

195
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,709
Take Max.
No, Mama.

196
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:28,960
Take him! Go!

197
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,170
I won't leave without you.

198
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,338
Yes, you will.

199
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,341
Upon your father's grave,
you will.

200
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,801
There's no time
for heroics, Max.

201
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,260
One or none.

202
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,762
Come.

203
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,406
The papers are inside.

204
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,725
They don't look great,
but they'll have to do.

205
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,061
Go find him.

206
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,982
Forgive me.

207
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,410
<i>When I finally caught
up with Max Vandenberg's soul...</i>

208
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,746
<i>it was this moment
that haunted him the most.</i>

209
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,208
<i>For leaving his mother.</i>

210
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,087
<i>For feeling that awful,
light-headed relief...</i>

211
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,048
<i>that he would live.</i>

212
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,182
Jesse Owens is
the fastest man on earth.

213
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,309
Hey, watch out, you two.

214
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,813
What are you doing, Papa?

215
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,315
Working, for once.

216
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,819
I thought you painted signs,
not scraped them off.

217
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,948
Well, the scraping-off
business is picking up, Rudy.

218
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,284
What can you do?

219
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,494
"Accountant."

220
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,874
You make me proud, girl.
She's clever, Rudy.

221
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,667
<i>Ja,</i> sir.

222
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,378
What's an accountant?

223
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,797
Something we will never need.

224
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,093
"We wish you..."

225
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,598
"every success..."

226
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,559
"with your..."

227
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,872
"career..."
Mmm.

228
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,416
"In the funeral..."

229
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,698
"Business."

230
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,241
"Funeral business."

231
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,287
We made it.
Your first book.

232
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,748
Congratulations.

233
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,254
So, promise me
one thing, Liesel.

234
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,217
If I die anytime soon,
make sure they bury me right.

235
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,635
<i>Ja?
Ja.</i>

236
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,471
No skipping chapter six.

237
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,098
Can we start again?

238
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,893
Tomorrow.

239
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,729
But it is tomorrow.

240
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,147
You sleep now.

241
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,913
His name was Werner.

242
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,760
Come.
I have a surprise for you.

243
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,974
It's very dark here.

244
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,851
We had better turn on the light.

245
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,941
It's a dictionary.

246
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,531
Some of the words
we have learned.

247
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,538
Add as many as you like.

248
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,499
It's yours.

249
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,880
Thank you, Papa.

250
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,170
He's done it!
He's made history!

251
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,588
Jesse Owens...

252
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,131
the fastest man alive!

253
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,482
Hey!

254
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,260
What is this?

255
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,682
Ow!

256
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,528
You want to remain a member?
Teach your son!

257
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,122
Why?

258
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,416
Why Jesse Owens?

259
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,709
Why?

260
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,394
He's the fastest man on earth.

261
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,047
The fastest man on earth!

262
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,231
The boy is crazy.

263
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,592
- Ow! That hurts.
- Sit still, Rudy.

264
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,804
It's even in his earholes.

265
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,222
Barbra...

266
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,140
Fine, you deal with him.

267
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,897
Son...

268
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:45,235
you can't go around painting
yourself black, you hear?

269
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,569
Why not?

270
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,740
Because you shouldn't
want to be black people.

271
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,742
Why?

272
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,746
Because I say so. <i>Ja?</i>

273
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:02,585

put the flag?

281
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,863
If we don't find it, it's going to
look like we're saying something.

282
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,270
All right, all right, all right.

283
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,033
I'm going to look
in the basement.

284
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,285
God in Heaven.

285
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,622
Liesel, I know you
like it down here...

286
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,125
but don't you think
you should be outside a bit?

287
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,835
I'm writing Mama a letter.

288
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,712
Well, that's very good.

289
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,673
Please tell her, from me, I could
do without all the nagging.

290
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,467
Not that mama.

291
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,928
I see.

292
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,057
What are you telling her?

293
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,851
Everything.

294
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,313
About you <i>und</i> Mama <i>und</i> Rudy.

295
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,024
Can you send it for me?

296
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,026
Well...

297
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,278
You could give it to the woman
who brought me here.

298
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,697
<i>Frau</i> Heinrich? <i>Ja.</i>

299
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,993
I'm sure she would do her best
to pass it on.

300
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,122
Ah, found it.

301
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,759
What is she doing
writing to her mother, anyway?

302
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,344
She's her mother.

303
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,012
I'm not going to
waste good money...

304
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,848
on a stamp for a letter that's
never going to be answered.

305
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,517
What was I to say?

306
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,520
Hans?
Alex.

307
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,857
Good man.
Are you ready to go?

308
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,526
Of course he is.

309
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,710
Liesel!

310
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,255
Come on, Liesel,
we'll miss the parade.

311
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,745
Right.

312
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,456
Come on, let's go.

313
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,416
<i>Saumensch.</i>
Hello, Rudy.

314
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,009
During this National
Socialist revolution

315
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:20,223
as much as our nation prospers,
we should not decrease

316
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,726
our determination to
cleanse ourselves morally

317
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,895
and intellectually from within

318
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:32,610
Education, theater,
films, literature, the press

319
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,655
these are the supporting pillars

320
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:40,118
which shape the unique
personality of our nation

321
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:47,709
And that is why we
have gathered here tonight

322
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:53,256
to free ourselves from
any intellectual dirt

323
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:05,310
We will exterminate the illness

324
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,772
that infected Germany
for the last twenty years

325
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,194
We will completely
destroy the chains

326
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,031
that were forged to enslave us

327
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:25,663
We will fight our
enemies and if that means war

328
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:30,627
then we will stand by our
<i>Führer</i> until the final victory

329
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:37,842
Such a war will see
our nation restored

330
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,138
and bring an end to our enemies

331
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,434
The end of plutocrats

332
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,480
The end of communists

333
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,650
And the end of Jews

334
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,779
To our great German Empire

335
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:02,533
and to our beloved <i>Führer,</i>
Adolf Hitler

336
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,702
<i>- Sieg!</i>
<i>- Heil!</i>

337
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,216
Hey, Jesse Owens.

338
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,634
Push off, Franz.

339
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,219
Leave him alone.

340
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:06,472
Did you like the speech, <i>Dummkopf?
</i> Were you listening?

341
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,724
What about it?

342
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,475
Your mother was one, wasn't she?

343
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,769
A communist?
That's what they say.

344
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,313
Who's "they"?

345
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,731
You even look like one.

346
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,441
What are you talking about?

347
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,484
I'm not talking to you, Steiner.

348
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:19,986
She knows.

349
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,239
Burn a book.

350
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,950
Go on, burn a book.

351
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:29,412
Go on! I'll be watching.
Both of you.

352
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,082
What was that about?

353
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,751
Nothing.

354
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:43,528
Liesel.

355
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,240
Where have you been? I said
to meet me at the church.

356
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,825
Sorry, Papa.

357
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,243
Let's go now.

358
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,882
What is it?

359
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,759
Nothing.

360
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,348
Are you sick?

361
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,517
<i>Nein.</i> I'm fine.

362
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,628
Tell me,
what is the matter with you?

363
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,194
What the hell is this?

364
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:27,989
You stole it?

365
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,074
Sorry, Papa.

366
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,204
Are you going to tell Mama?

367
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,957
Papa?

368
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,209
Did anyone see you?

369
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,755
I'll tell you what.

370
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,758
Let's make this our secret.

371
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,219
We'll read it
like the other book.

372
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,597
In the basement.

373
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,223
Thank you, Papa.

374
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,392
Good, now.

375
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,563
We better get back before Mama worries.
We don't want that.

376
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,317
Liesel, come.

377
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,075
What is it?

378
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,165
Liesel?

379
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,836
My mother isn't
coming back, is she?

380
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,717
Is she a communist?

381
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,554
Who told you that?
Is she?

382
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,601
Did the <i>Führer</i> take her away?

383
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,480
Then I hate the <i>Führer.</i>

384
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:43,814
<i>Nein.</i>

385
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,109
You can't say that.

386
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,612
Don't ever say that.

387
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,158
Understand?

388
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,247
Come.

389
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:07,004
<i>"The Invisible Man</i>
by H.G. Wells."

390
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,798
Sounds good.

391
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,469
"Chapter one."

392
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,889
"The Strange Man's Arrival."

393
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,727
"The stranger
came early in Feb..."

394
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,774
"February." Ah.

395
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,653
Good girl.

396
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,995
Who's that?

397
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:42,164
Papa, who is it?

398
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,344
Hans Hubermann?
Ja.

399
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,888
Do you still play the accordion?

400
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,557
Quickly.

401
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,061
Papa!
Liesel, go to bed!

402
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,188
What is this?

403
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,083
Max.

404
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,651
No. No.

405
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,029
Help me.

406
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,364
We'll put him upstairs.

407
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,284
Liesel, everything is fine.

408
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,329
Here we go.

409
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,009
I'll warm him some soup.

410
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,102
Who is he, Papa?

411
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:52,985
I have something very important
to tell you, Liesel.

412
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,197
You must listen.

413
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,210
That is not my accordion.

414
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,464
The man who owns that accordion
is this boy's father.

415
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:17,735
You stole it?

416
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,928
<i>Nein.</i>

417
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,097
I've been looking after it.

418
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,225
Did he die?

419
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,811
<i>Ja.</i>

420
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,398
Many years ago.

421
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,109
Before you were born.

422
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,988
I saw him die.

423
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,575
In a war.

424
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,552
You were in a war?

425
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:44,578
<i>Ja.</i>

426
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,916
His father gave up his life...

427
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,876
for me.

428
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,630
And I made
a promise to the family...

429
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:58,426
if ever I could help them, I would.
I gave them my word.

430
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,930
Now, I need you to promise me.

431
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,783
I need you to give me your word

432
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:08,644
that you will not tell
anyone about our visitor.

433
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,857
Nobody. Not a soul.

434
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,276
Not even Rudy.

435
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,696
I mean it, Liesel.

436
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,116
Not a soul.

437
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,577
Understand?

438
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,037
<i>Ja.</i>

439
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:31,125
A person is only as good
as their word, Liesel.

440
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,336
Do I have yours?

441
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,631
<i>Ja,</i> Papa.

442
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,842
I promise.

443
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,537
Did you talk to her?

444
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,789
<i>Ja.</i>

445
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,833
She can't tell a soul.

446
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,418
She knows.

447
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,716
Can we trust her?
She's our daughter.

448
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,676
She's a child!
Rosa.

449
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,012
We have no choice.

450
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,727
He looks like death.

451
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,814
He's probably forgotten
what food tastes like.

452
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,207
What are we
going to feed him on?

453
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,833
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves!

454
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,901
We will make do.

455
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,154
"We will make do."

456
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,826
We have always known
that one day this may happen.

457
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,420
We could turn him in tomorrow.

458
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,565
The authorities
would understand.

459
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,025
We could say
that it was late at night...

460
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,235
Rosa.

461
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,303
I know.
He came to us.

462
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,558
I owe his family everything.
I know.

463
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,601
Then, that's all.

464
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,398
We'll just go about things
as normally as possible.

465
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,238
Hello.

466
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,157
Hello.

467
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,079
What were you dreaming about?

468
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,123
My mother.

469
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,336
Is that your book?

470
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,504
<i>Ja.</i>

471
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,715
<i>Nein,</i> it...

472
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,302
It wasn't always mine.

473
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,514
Did you steal it?

474
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,183
<i>Nein.</i>

475
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,144
Can I see it?
It's...

476
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,789
It's not for children.

477
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,567
Ah.

478
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,111
Good morning, Max.

479
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,949
You have met Liesel?

480
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:51,784
Liesel.

481
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,119
Don't worry.

482
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,538
She's a good girl.

483
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:09,343
Not a word.

484
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,346
Good, <i>Saumensch.</i>

485
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,104
What's the rush?

486
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,939
I have to get home.

487
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,566
Race you.

488
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,994
I have to go inside.

489
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,746
What do you want?
My permission?

490
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,058
<i>Nein.</i> I'm just telling you.

491
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,209
Fine.

492
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:48,048
See you, <i>Saumensch.</i>

493
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,884
Where have you been?
You're late.

494
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,053
I ran as fast as I could.

495
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,264
And you mentioned
nothing to no one?

496
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,182
<i>Nein,</i> Mama.
Rosa...

497
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,276
Liesel! He's asleep.

498
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,421
Mmm.

499
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:31,008
At least someone knows how
to appreciate my cooking.

500
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:40,392
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

501
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,824
Is he going to be all right?

502
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,243
Of course.

503
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,792
You're a curious girl.

504
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,086
I didn't mean to.

505
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:52,756
It's all right.

506
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,226
What is it about?

507
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:06,895
Hitler.

508
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,149
Are you hiding from Hitler?

509
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:11,608
<i>Ja.</i>

510
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:15,904
Are you a communist?

511
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:18,365
I'm a Jew.

512
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,869
Did he take away your mother?

513
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,079
Probably.

514
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,132
Don't worry.

515
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,051
I cried a lot
when I first came, too.

516
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,932
The soup is terrible, isn't it?

517
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:48,729
You may find this
hard to believe, but...

518
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,416
it's the best thing
I've ever thrown up.

519
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,501
Liesel!

520
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,171
I have a job for you.

521
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:25,432
And don't forget
to count the money.

522
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,619
Come back with the right amount

523
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,938
or don't bother
coming back at all.

524
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,757
The <i>Bürgermeister's</i> house.

525
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:02,010
Are you sure?

526
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,847
Do you see any other houses
looking like this?

527
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,519
He had dinner
with the Fuhrer once.

528
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,404
Laundry.

529
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,239
Come in.

530
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:09,578
Go on.

531
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,656
Wait.

532
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,262
<i>Danke schön.</i>

533
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:18,897
So, you like books?

534
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:35,122
Come.

535
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:48,236
<i>"The Dream Carrier."</i>

536
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,302
Rudy.

537
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:15,972
I have to go.

538
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:22,771
You can come back
whenever you want.

539
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,773
It will be here.

540
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:29,236
Ja, <i>Frau</i> Hermann.

541
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,616
Call me "Ilsa."

542
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,618
What shall I call you?

543
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,204
Liesel.

544
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,627
You are a brave girl, Liesel.

545
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,642
<i>Come back, Saumensch!</i>

546
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:02,310
Catch me!

547
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:08,692
Hey, <i>Dummkopf!</i> Did you hear? England declared
war on us! We're at war with England!

548
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,489
We're at war!

549
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,509
England declared war!

550
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:23,832
<i>It's always been the same,
the excitement and rush to war.</i>

551
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:26,501
<i>I've met so many young men
over the years...</i>

552
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:29,671
<i>who have thought they were
running at their enemy.</i>

553
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,508
<i>When the truth was,
they were running to me.</i>

554
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,523
<i>Ja!</i>

555
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:51,526
Excellent.

556
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,748
You should look
where you're going next time.

557
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,126
Drop dead, Franz.

558
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:13,006
What's up, Jesse Owens? I
thought you liked being black.

559
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:37,739
Who is Johann?

560
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:43,787
He used to love to read.

561
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,666
And he was brave.
Just like you.

562
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,088
This is all him.
Everything he knew.

563
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:55,382
All here.

564
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,342
All in its place.

565
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,648
They never found his body.

566
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:18,113
If they could have shown me his
body, I would have believed them.

567
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,824
But how can a mother give up?

568
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:25,620
A mother never
gives up on her child.

569
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,085
I have to go.

570
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,151
Do you think my mother
really loved me?

571
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,362
Of course.

572
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:04,033
Every mother loves her child.

573
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,454
Even Hitler's.

574
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:15,211
Do you think she writes to him?

575
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,514
<i>"Dear Führer...</i>

576
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,394
just wait until
your father gets home."

577
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,354
"Love, Mama."

578
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:36,483
"Dear Führer,
clean up your mess."

579
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,860
"Dear Führer,
who cut your hair?"

580
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,904
"You're not going
out in that, are you?"

581
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,198
"What's that
growing on your lip?"

582
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,158
"Don't raise
your voice at me."

583
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,203
"Stop spitting when you yell."

584
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,549
Hans...

585
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,052
he's getting bedsores.

586
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:06,971
Then he needs to
get up and move about.

587
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:10,058
He can't just walk around.

588
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:11,226
Why not?

589
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,102
Because people will see in.

590
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:19,234
He can't lay still forever.
He needs to be moved.

591
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:21,736
Why?

592
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,073
The mouth on it!
Because I say so.

593
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,241
Rosa.

594
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,909
And what do you propose?

595
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,745
"Propose"?
Listen to this one.

596
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:33,581
I propose that we
put him downstairs.

597
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,634
It's not good, we know that.

598
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,596
I'm sorry.

599
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:52,433
Please don't apologize. I've
put you all in such danger.

600
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,935
It's more than I deserve.

601
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,438
Liesel's lessons.
It is a dictionary.

602
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:00,400
I tried to make it as
comfortable as I could.

603
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,240
I'm sorry, there's no bed.

604
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,827
If anyone saw, you know?

605
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,163
You feel free to do your
lessons whenever you want.

606
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,541
Make sure you knock first.

607
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,296
I'm just downstairs.
I'm not going anywhere.

608
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:23,673
Promise.

609
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:51,034
Don't give me that look.

610
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,341
"Jellyfish."

611
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:08,509
"Jellyfish."

612
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:09,636
Jellyfish.

613
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:23,399
Tell me,
where do you get these words?

614
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,154
It's a secret.

615
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:31,741
And who would I tell?

616
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,206
The <i>Bürgermeister's</i> wife.

617
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,417
She lets me read her books.

618
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,795
I memorize them.

619
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,341
"Memory is
the scribe of the soul."

620
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,010
Do you know who said that?

621
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,974
A man called Aristotle.

622
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:59,227
Can you do me a favor?

623
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,188
Can you describe the day for me?

624
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,818
What's it like outside?

625
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:08,569
It's cloudy.

626
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:09,821
No, no, no.

627
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:12,115
Make the words yours.

628
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,577
If your eyes could speak...

629
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,746
what would they say?

630
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,586
It's a pale day.

631
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,256
"Pale." Good. Go on.

632
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:35,096
Everything's
stuck behind a cloud.

633
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,433
<i>Und</i> the sun...

634
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:40,727
doesn't look like the sun.

635
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:42,979
What does it look like?

636
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:49,485
Like a silver oyster?

637
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,455
Thank you. I saw that.

638
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,837
We're hiding a Jew.

639
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:52,173
Johann?

640
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:54,967
<i>Nein.</i>

641
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,012
It's Liesel.

642
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,980
What's the meaning of this?

643
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:27,375
<i>Und</i> he didn't say why?

644
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,130
I don't understand it.

645
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:35,383
I've always ironed his shirts
in exactly the same way.

646
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,593
Maybe they can't
afford it any longer.

647
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,303
They can't afford it?

648
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:41,722
We can't afford it.

649
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:47,562
It's another customer gone.

650
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,247
And four mouths to feed.

651
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,821
Well.

652
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:01,325
It's two meals a day
from now on, not three.

653
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,578
That's all there is to it.

654
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:33,524
I've made you a suit.

655
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:40,031
I want you to wear it
on your 14th birthday.

656
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,618
You'll be back then, Papa.

657
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,411
Won't you?

658
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,148
Hans!

659
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:57,942
Rosa...

660
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,152
I'm asking you,
I'm begging you...

661
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,699
would you please keep your
mouth shut for five minutes?

662
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,498
I brought you something.

663
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:14,542
Is this today's?
<i>Ja.</i>

664
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:16,877
A gift from Franz Deutscher.

665
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,880
That boy doesn't know
how generous he is.

666
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,301
"Hitler poised
to take Moscow."

667
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,765
The world has turned mad.

668
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,685
But...

669
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,729
aren't we winning the war?

670
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:41,277
Max?

671
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,911
Where's my weather report?

672
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:07,094
You're full of wonders.

673
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,348
I've got an idea.

674
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,976
What on earth are you doing?

675
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:05,861
Go, go, go!

676
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:20,835
Max.

677
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,257
I have no more snow!

678
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:28,134
Get him, Max!

679
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,303
What in God's name are
you <i>Saukerle</i> doing down here?

680
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:32,430
Rosa!

681
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:39,770
There's a madwoman on the battlefield!
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

682
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:42,273
I'm unarmed!

683
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:04,837
This is the stupidest thing
that I have ever done.

684
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:07,047
<i>Und</i> look how happy you are.

685
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:15,639
What do we do when it melts?

686
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,224
You mop it up, <i>Saumensch.</i>

687
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:19,894
It won't melt.
It's freezing down here.

688
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:23,397
I don't know how
you do it every night.

689
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:25,191
Please, don't think about me.

690
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,318
Nonsense.
We all think about you.

691
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,740
This is the best Christmas.

692
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,702
This is my first Christmas.

693
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:40,789
Now you know what you've
been missing out on.

694
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,083
We should call it a night.

695
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,252
<i>Nein,</i> Papa. Please.

696
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:46,545
Listen to your father.

697
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,672
You can stay a little longer.

698
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,050
Oh, you're too soft
on that girl.

699
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,018
I've made you a Christmas gift.

700
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,564
It's all I had.

701
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,456
But...

702
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:23,582
Open it.

703
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,128
"For Liesel...

704
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:30,422
from Max."

705
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,844
What does it say?

706
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,892
"Write."

707
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,814
In my religion...

708
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:50,067
we're taught that
every living thing...

709
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:52,903
every leaf, every bird...

710
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:57,116
is only alive because it contains
the secret word for life.

711
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:03,831
That's the only difference between
us and a lump of clay. A word.

712
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,836
Words are life, Liesel.

713
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,464
All those blank pages...

714
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,341
they're for you to fill.

715
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,874
My God.

716
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:52,838
Is he going to die?

717
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,340
Shut up!

718
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:57,384
I won't have that talk in this house.
Do you understand?

719
01:08:57,843 --> 01:09:01,221
I haven't starved us all for the
better part of two years...

720
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:04,058
just so that he could die.

721
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,686
It's my fault.

722
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,022
Why is it your fault?

723
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:12,983
It was my idea
to build that snowman.

724
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,861
Why did we build it?

725
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,406
Because we had to.

726
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:27,373
You said you weren't
going anywhere, Max.

727
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:29,750
You promised.

728
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,857
<i>"The Invisible Man...</i>

729
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,276
by H.G. Wells."

730
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,743
"The stranger came
early in February...

731
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:06,787
<i>one wintry day...</i>

01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,833

<i>The last snowfall...</i>

01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:25,973

"Chapter One."

739
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:41,715
Ilsa?

<i>"The eyes in the faces
he passed on the street...</i>

and finger his guilt.</i>

742
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,165
<i>But things were
out of his control.</i>

743
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,918
<i>He had cut himself loose...</i>

744
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:23,507
and was drifting faster and
faster towards his fate.

745
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:28,345
<i>...was the dustiness
of the floor...</i>

746
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:33,559
<i>the feeling that the clothes were
more next to her than on her...</i>

747
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:39,231
and the sudden realization that
this would all be for nothing."

748
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,945
- Did you lose something?
- Rudy!

749
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,197
What are you doing?

750
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,408
Spying on you, obviously.

751
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,076
Give me that!

752
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:56,248
So, let me guess. You forgot
where the front door was.

753
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:00,460
I've got to hand it to you,
<i>Saumensch,</i> you've got guts...

754
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:02,629
stealing from the <i>Bürgermeister.</i>

755
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:04,298
Keep it down.

756
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,925
I'm not stealing.
I'm borrowing.

757
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:08,735
Whatever you are "borrowing"...

758
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,262
I just wish you let me in on it.

759
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:11,722
It's not what you think.

760
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:13,140
Then...

761
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:14,641
What is it?

762
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:17,978
I'm borrowing books.
That's all.

763
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:20,606
Books? Are you nuts?

764
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,941
We are starving out here
and you're stealing books?

765
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:24,318
Stop using that word.

766
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:28,155
How about food? Did you ever even
think of looking in the kitchen?

767
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,281
<i>Nein.</i>

768
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,658
We could have planned this
better if you told me.

769
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:34,828
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

770
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:38,707
You know, for a best friend,
you keep a lot to yourself.

771
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:43,837
What's that supposed to mean?

772
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:46,089
Who's Max?

773
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:49,426
Who is he?

774
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:51,428
Liesel!

775
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,143
Tell me what's going on!

776
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:01,688
Tell me, <i>Saumensch,</i> who is he?

777
01:14:03,357 --> 01:14:05,484
Is he your boyfriend?

778
01:14:05,776 --> 01:14:07,152
What?

779
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,363
Is that what you think?

780
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,073
Then what?

781
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,866
Tell me, who is he?

782
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:14,701
I can't.

783
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,119
Why not?

784
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,040
It's a secret.

785
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,209
You don't trust me?

786
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:25,212
It's not like that, Rudy.
I can't.

787
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,881
If I...

788
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:32,302
If I told you,
I'd have to go away.

789
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,889
Papa would have to go away.

790
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,726
God knows what
would happen to him.

791
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,145
"Him"?

792
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,774
You're hiding someone?

793
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:50,153
You're hiding someone,
aren't you?

794
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:51,738
Liesel!

795
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:57,119
One spit, "Yes."
Two spits, "No."

796
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:05,460
I knew it.

797
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,839
No one can know, Rudy.

798
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:10,507
I mean it.

799
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:12,342
You can trust me.

800
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:14,928
Don't worry.

801
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:17,180
I won't tell anybody.

802
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,307
You won't tell anyone what?

803
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:24,187
Hello, Steiner.
Hello, <i>Dummkopf.</i>

804
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,608
What's that behind your back?

805
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:30,277
Give it to me.

806
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:32,863
Leave him alone!

807
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:34,156
I said, give it to me!

808
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:37,743
Give it to me!

809
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:43,290
What was that?
What was it?

810
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,625
None of your business,
Deutscher.

811
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:50,505
Leave him!

812
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:57,554
You're done for, Steiner.

813
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:00,348
I'm reporting you.

814
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:03,268
For what?
Having a diary?

815
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:06,188
I know you're up to something.

816
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:15,614
Come on!

817
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:24,831
Come on!

818
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,668
What are you doing?

819
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:31,671
I know where it is!
I watched it!

820
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,509
It's freezing, Rudy.
You'll die in there.

821
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:39,971
Rudy!

822
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:45,477
Rudy?

823
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:49,189
Rudy!

824
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,359
Rudy?

825
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:56,113
Rudy, I can't swim!

826
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,281
Rudy!

827
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,450
Please!

828
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,247
I got it!

829
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,541
Rudy!

830
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,709
I thought you were...

831
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:11,545
Never mind.

832
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:13,797
Trust me now?

833
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,049
<i>Ja.</i>

834
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:18,844
Then, how about that kiss?

835
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,388
Come on.
You're going to freeze.

836
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,865
Good night...

837
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,658
book thief.

838
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:47,789
Good night, fish.

839
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,520
I told Rudy.

840
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,902
Here, come on!
I'm here!

841
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,542
Look!

842
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,088
What are they doing?

843
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,300
Checking basements. They checked
my cousin's last night.

844
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:43,011
For what?

845
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:46,556
Can we get on with it now?

846
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:48,225
Come on!

847
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,102
Here! Pass it!

848
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:55,649
Are you nuts?

849
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:05,158
I have to go inside.

850
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:06,660
Oh, great.

851
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:07,827
She's hurt.

852
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:09,287
Never stopped her before.

853
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:11,081
I'm fine.

854
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:21,508
Mama!
Why are you shouting?

855
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:22,676
They're coming.

856
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:23,843
Who?

857
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:25,512
They're checking basements.

858
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:34,688
Hans, come quickly!

859
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:36,847
What is it?
Somebody is coming.

860
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:38,608
They are checking basements.

861
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:41,820
We have to hide him.

862
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:44,030
Get him up here, under the bed.

863
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,135
Max!

864
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,203
Max!

865
01:19:51,371 --> 01:19:52,664
Come on. Come on.

866
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,001
So, do they give you a gun
when you join the army?

867
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:57,460
Mama!

868
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:00,714
Oh, my God.

869
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,216
Hans, leave that!

870
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,560
Wolfy. What a surprise.
How are you?

871
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:16,229
You want Hans?

872
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:17,522
Hans!

873
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:20,233
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i> We're just
checking people's basements.

874
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,901
Oh, Liesel,
will you get <i>Herr</i> Edel...

875
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:23,903
a glass of water?
No need.

876
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,322
This shouldn't take a second.

877
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:30,201
You should bandage that.

878
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:33,079
Oh, my God, Liesel! <i>Ja!</i>
Oh, would you do me a favor...

879
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:35,832
and get me the medicine chest?
It's just on that...

880
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,167
Where is the man trap?

881
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,502
The what?

882
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,837
The door to your basement.

883
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,649
Ah!

884
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,176
Wolfa.

885
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:48,504
I heard you were coming.
I've been working, tidying up.

886
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,723
Heard from who?

887
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,893
Who was it
collecting our washing?

888
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:56,269
<i>Frau</i> Schneider.

889
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:59,105
<i>Frau</i> Schneider, <i>ja.</i>
She mentioned it.

890
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:00,315
Come.

891
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:13,411
Is there a light in here?

892
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,121
<i>Ja,</i> of course.

893
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:18,375
I should probably
throw most of this stuff out.

894
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,961
You wouldn't believe what we
find in some people's basements.

895
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,089
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me.

896
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:26,900
Liesel, she is
always playing down here.

897
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:29,511
I keep telling her to
get out in the fresh air.

898
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,144
What is this about, anyway?

899
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,331
What's this?

900
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,924
My brushes.

901
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,097
You should look
after them better.

902
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:17,325
Liesel, you know,
she never listens to me.

903
01:22:23,481 --> 01:22:25,942
Still no work, eh, Hans?

904
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:27,902
Not a lot.

905
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:32,824
You should have taken my
advice and joined the party.

906
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:35,034
Then your wife wouldn't
have to break her back...

907
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,829
washing people's
underwear to feed you.

908
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:42,041
Isn't that right, Rosa?

909
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,335
<i>Ja.</i>

910
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:47,714
What's wrong with you?

911
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,718
I've never heard you
turn down an opportunity...

912
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,470
to give this one some lip.

913
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,222
Well...

914
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:01,561
if the <i>Saukerl</i> would get off
his lazy backside and help...

915
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,705
then maybe I
would have the energy

916
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,191
to give him all the lip
that he deserves.

917
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:14,741
I don't know how
you live with her.

918
01:23:15,325 --> 01:23:16,576
Neither do I.

919
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,834
Never too late to join, Hans.

920
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:33,092
So, how's our basement?

921
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,678
Perfectly useless.
The ceiling is too low.

922
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:37,055
What for?

923
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:39,933
Air raid shelters.
Every street has to have one.

924
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,559
You should be more careful.

925
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,019
<i>Ja, Herr</i> Edel.

926
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,406
Hans...

927
01:23:58,243 --> 01:24:00,954
What if he does die?

928
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:06,417
We can't just leave him there.

929
01:24:10,255 --> 01:24:13,049
The smell will give us away.

930
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,472
Hans, I'm afraid.

931
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:23,935
Look, if it happens...

932
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:26,771
if he dies...

933
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:31,150
we'll simply have to find a way.

934
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:35,113
He's not dead yet.

935
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,703
All right?

936
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:01,347
<i>Frau</i> Hubermann?

937
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,391
I need to speak to Liesel.

938
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:06,561
Of course. Liesel?

939
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:13,209
Ow!

940
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:14,986
What did you do with it,
you little thief?

941
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:16,170
What, Mama?

942
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,363
Don't "what" me.

943
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:19,173
I have told you a hundred times

944
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,242
to leave that thing alone,
but do you listen?

945
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:28,166
Back to work.

946
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:34,714
I'm sorry.

947
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:37,383
Mama, what is it?

948
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:41,554
It's Max, isn't it?

949
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,773
He said that
this belongs to you.

950
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:56,569
Who said?

951
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,573
He woke up.

952
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,741
He's going to live!

953
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:02,950
Mama!

954
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:09,749
Careful.

955
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:14,921
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

956
01:26:15,463 --> 01:26:18,091
I couldn't think of
any other way to tell you.

957
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:20,259
I know it's silly of me.
I know.

958
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,345
<i>Nein,</i> Mama, it's not.

959
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:23,554
Thank you.

960
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:27,225
Well, you'd better wipe
that smile off your face.

961
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:30,728
Just go back in there...

962
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:34,565
and act like I'm the witch,
you know? <i>Ja?</i>

963
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:36,484
<i>Ja.</i>

964
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:39,946
Just know that...

965
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:43,950
that I...

966
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,037
Go on.

967
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:54,335
Do you need a bit of
help with that smile?

968
01:27:02,385 --> 01:27:03,845
If I ever catch you...

969
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:05,513
doing that sort of
thing again, so help me...

970
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,056
I will string you up
by your toes.

971
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:09,350
Do you hear me, <i>Saumensch?</i>

972
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:10,810
Understood?

973
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:38,171
Max!

974
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:39,422
Max!

975
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:47,722
I knew you'd live.

976
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:50,558
With all that reading, you
wouldn't leave me in peace.

977
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:52,727
You heard me?

978
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:54,061
Of course.

979
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:56,272
Thank you.

980
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,201
So...

981
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,789
How's Rudy?

982
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,337
I don't know.

983
01:28:19,504 --> 01:28:21,714
Rudy's a pain in the neck.

984
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:29,514
The only thing worse than a boy you
hate is a boy you like, right?

985
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:35,269
Liesel, it's an air raid!

986
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:39,732
Go on, then.

987
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,692
What about you?

988
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:44,195
I'm here. I'll be fine.

989
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:46,030
It's a basement, isn't it?

990
01:28:46,197 --> 01:28:47,490
Did you hear me, <i>Saumensch?</i>

991
01:28:47,657 --> 01:28:48,741
<i>Ja,</i> Mama.

992
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:22,293
<i>While 10,000 souls hid
their heads in fear and trembled...</i>

993
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:26,839
<i>one Jew thanked God for the
stars that blessed his eyes.</i>

994
01:30:54,784 --> 01:30:55,826
It's all I have.

995
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:57,119
I'm sorry.

996
01:30:57,662 --> 01:31:00,331
I was saving it for
my husband's return, but...

997
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:02,625
Thank you. Very much.

998
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:18,933
He's a Jew.

999
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,451
They found his
birth certificate.

1000
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:22,645
He's a "Lehman"
with one "N", not two.

1001
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:24,689
Please!

1002
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:28,442
My son is in the army!

1003
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:31,237
He's fighting on the front!

1004
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,382
Please.
In the car!

1005
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:37,576
Please!

1006
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,165
You know me.

1007
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:44,792
Please!

1008
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:47,795
You know me! Please!

1009
01:31:48,004 --> 01:31:49,380
I'm German!

1010
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:51,757
Please...

1011
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:54,593
I've known this man
my whole life. We all have.

1012
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:56,345
He's a good person.

1013
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:57,763
What's your name?

1014
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:03,269
Hans Hubermann.

1015
01:32:06,856 --> 01:32:08,941
Please! He's a good man.
Get back!

1016
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:10,443
Papa!

1017
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:12,611
Papa!

1018
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:14,989
Liesel!

1019
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:35,926
Rudy!

1020
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:39,972
Rudy.

1021
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:50,941
Keep still.

1022
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:53,110
What was I thinking?

1023
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,280
He took my name.

1024
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:01,093
Christ on the cross,
what have I done?

1025
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:06,457
I've ruined us!
I've ruined us!

1026
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:09,418
I'm sorry, Rosa.

1027
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:11,462
I'm sorry.

1028
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,345
I don't understand.

1029
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:24,725
What did he do so wrong?

1030
01:33:26,811 --> 01:33:29,647
He reminded people
of their humanity.

1031
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:33,734
Can't he apologize?

1032
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,445
To who?

1033
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:38,447
Hitler?

1034
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:43,828
Will they take him away?

1035
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:45,037
I don't know.

1036
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:47,289
But...

1037
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,960
if they come and find me here...

1038
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:53,838
they'll take all of you away.

1039
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:00,386
No, Max.

1040
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,848
I have to, Liesel.

1041
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,268
I'm sorry.

1042
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:09,895
But you promised.

1043
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:13,023
It's for your own good.

1044
01:34:15,067 --> 01:34:16,402
For your family.

1045
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:19,738
But you're my family.

1046
01:34:34,545 --> 01:34:36,755
You've kept me alive, Liesel.

1047
01:34:38,215 --> 01:34:39,550
Don't ever forget that.

1048
01:34:39,717 --> 01:34:41,068
I can't lose someone else.

1049
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,262
I'm not lost to you, Liesel.

1050
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:46,724
You'll always be able
to find me in your words.

1051
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,435
That's where I'll live on.

1052
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:56,483
Max...

1053
01:34:57,818 --> 01:34:59,278
please.

1054
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:02,781
Thank you.

1055
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:11,582
Here.

1056
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,461
It's two blankets
and a pair of socks.

1057
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,838
And a nice piece of cheese
that I've been saving.

1058
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:19,298
Rosa...

1059
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:20,716
It's yours.

1060
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,441
Come. Liesel.

1061
01:36:19,608 --> 01:36:21,151
Leave her.

1062
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:43,716
Hans?

1063
01:36:45,968 --> 01:36:47,636
I'll get my coat.

1064
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:58,230
You are <i>Herr</i> Steiner?

1065
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:03,694
What?

1066
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:07,239
I'm here to talk
about your son, Rudy.

1067
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:09,158
Rudy Steiner.

1068
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:12,536
He lives next door.

1069
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:14,997
What do you want with him?

1070
01:37:32,306 --> 01:37:34,725
He's been selected
for elite training.

1071
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:37,269
He starts in the summer.

1072
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,191
I'm sorry, Barbra.

1073
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:54,995
Hans Hubermann?

1074
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:32,825
What's "conscripted"?

1075
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:16,201
Look how you've grown.

1076
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,203
I had not noticed.

1077
01:39:19,705 --> 01:39:21,039
I will miss you.

1078
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:23,208
Everyone's leaving.

1079
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,501
Even Rudy.

1080
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:27,045
Rudy is going to be fine.

1081
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:30,674
Look after your Mama, <i>ja?</i> She's
not as strong as she makes out.

1082
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,092
I know.

1083
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:33,510
Good girl.

1084
01:39:44,396 --> 01:39:45,898
Papa?

1085
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:50,152
Come home.

1086
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:56,927
What do you think?

1087
01:41:00,264 --> 01:41:01,890
The shoes let you down.

1088
01:41:03,976 --> 01:41:05,310
And the face.

1089
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:07,145
Coming?

1090
01:41:07,813 --> 01:41:09,314
Where are you going?

1091
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:12,818
Isn't it obvious?
I'm running away.

1092
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:20,409
Have you thought this through?

1093
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:21,910
<i>Ja.</i>

1094
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:24,371
I don't want to die.

1095
01:41:24,538 --> 01:41:27,416
There.
All thought through.

1096
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:31,795
Rudy, where are you
going to stay?

1097
01:41:31,962 --> 01:41:34,715
"You"? What about "we"?

1098
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:37,718
I didn't think
you were this serious.

1099
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:39,011
What do you call this?

1100
01:41:40,804 --> 01:41:42,264
Packed lunch?

1101
01:41:43,056 --> 01:41:46,226
Is there anything in there
besides your soccer ball?

1102
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:55,444
I miss my dad.

1103
01:42:00,407 --> 01:42:02,951
I don't even know if he's alive.

1104
01:42:08,415 --> 01:42:10,334
I'm not ready.

1105
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,421
I want to grow up before I die.

1106
01:42:16,757 --> 01:42:18,050
So did my brother.

1107
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,721
I'm sorry.

1108
01:42:25,932 --> 01:42:27,684
I didn't ask for this.

1109
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:29,394
Who would?

1110
01:42:32,064 --> 01:42:34,232
I hate Hitler.

1111
01:42:34,608 --> 01:42:35,817
Me, too.

1112
01:42:39,154 --> 01:42:41,156
I hate Hitler!

1113
01:42:42,991 --> 01:42:44,409
I hate Hitler!

1114
01:42:44,576 --> 01:42:46,286
I hate Hitler!

1115
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:49,081
I hate Hitler!
Hitler is a monkey's ass!

1116
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:50,749
Stick you, Hitler!

1117
01:43:02,594 --> 01:43:04,429
You're all I've got, Rudy.

1118
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:10,560
Let's go home.

1119
01:43:56,231 --> 01:43:58,275
<i>The bombs were
coming thicker now.</i>

1120
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,153
<i>It's probably fair to say...</i>

1121
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:05,699
<i>that no one was able to serve
the Führer as loyally as me.</i>

1122
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:50,660
There once was
a ghost of a boy...

1123
01:44:51,703 --> 01:44:54,414
who liked to live
in the shadows of things...

1124
01:44:55,499 --> 01:44:57,417
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1125
01:44:57,584 --> 01:44:59,503
What was that?
Who's speaking?

1126
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:03,006
What are you doing?

1127
01:45:03,173 --> 01:45:04,925
Telling a story.

1128
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:06,176
Why?

1129
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:07,385
Whose boy?

1130
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:09,554
She's telling a story.

1131
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:10,722
Speak up.

1132
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,433
Start again.

1133
01:45:16,353 --> 01:45:19,022
There once was
a ghost of a boy...

1134
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:21,399
who liked to
live in the shadows,

1135
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:23,777
so he wouldn't frighten people.

1136
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:30,200
His job was to wait for his
sister, who was still alive.

1137
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:34,371
She wasn't afraid of the dark...

1138
01:45:34,538 --> 01:45:38,250
because she knew
that's where her brother was.

1139
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:41,795
Go on.

1140
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:46,883
At night, when darkness
came to her room...

1141
01:45:47,968 --> 01:45:50,387
she would tell her brother
about the day.

1142
01:45:50,554 --> 01:45:55,058
She would remind him how the
sun felt on his skin...

1143
01:45:55,225 --> 01:45:57,644
and what the air
felt like to breathe...

1144
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:05,569
Or how snow felt on his tongue.
And that reminded her...

1145
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,280
that she was still alive.

1146
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:24,629
Gentlemen...

1147
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:26,965
how is everybody?

1148
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:30,527
Look at this one. They are starting
to conscript grandfathers.

1149
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,057
Hey, old man. Old man,
are they your own teeth?

1150
01:47:02,584 --> 01:47:06,004
Together,
they sat in the forest...

1151
01:47:06,171 --> 01:47:09,299
and watched the sun rise.

1152
01:47:09,466 --> 01:47:12,719
And as he disappeared
back into the shadows...

1153
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:16,348
she waved goodbye
for the last time.

1154
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,518
Oh, Liesel.

1155
01:48:04,604 --> 01:48:05,772
Max?

1156
01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:08,024
Max?

1157
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:09,985
Max!

1158
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,282
Max!

1159
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:18,702
<i>Saumensch!</i>

1160
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:20,662
What are you up to?

1161
01:48:20,829 --> 01:48:21,871
Max?

1162
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:24,749
Liesel!
Max?

1163
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:27,460
Do you know Max?
Liesel!

1164
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:29,129
Do you know Max?

1165
01:48:31,798 --> 01:48:33,216
Max?

1166
01:48:36,386 --> 01:48:37,887
Do you know Max?

1167
01:48:45,353 --> 01:48:47,272
Get out of here,
you stupid girl!

1168
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:50,650
Liesel!

1169
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:53,611
I won't forget you.
I won't forget you.

1170
01:48:53,862 --> 01:48:55,405
I won't forget you.

1171
01:48:55,572 --> 01:48:57,449
I won't forget you, Max.

1172
01:48:58,324 --> 01:48:59,367
Liesel!

1173
01:49:05,582 --> 01:49:06,624
Go out!

1174
01:49:07,459 --> 01:49:08,460
Liesel!

1175
01:49:20,972 --> 01:49:23,516
You're too much like your
father, you know that?

1176
01:49:25,602 --> 01:49:27,854
What's wrong with that?

1177
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:32,776
Nothing.

1178
01:49:40,033 --> 01:49:42,285
Hey, <i>Saumensch,</i> want to play?

1179
01:49:42,452 --> 01:49:44,579
<i>Nein,</i> not today.

1180
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:47,457
Then let's steal something.

1181
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:50,043
I don't steal. I borrow.

1182
01:49:50,668 --> 01:49:55,507
Then let's go borrow Franz Deutscher's
bike <i>und</i> get out of here.

1183
01:49:56,674 --> 01:49:57,759
Can't you see I'm reading?

1184
01:49:59,177 --> 01:50:00,470
Are you still angry with me?

1185
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:03,556
For what?

1186
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,185
Saving you.

1187
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:09,312
<i>Nein,</i> Rudy.

1188
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:10,814
You're very brave.

1189
01:50:26,913 --> 01:50:28,331
Papa!

1190
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,876
You're home!

1191
01:50:39,384 --> 01:50:41,177
What is it, my girl?

1192
01:50:46,975 --> 01:50:48,393
My girl.

1193
01:50:49,269 --> 01:50:50,645
My girl.

1194
01:51:15,003 --> 01:51:17,380
It's nice to hear you play.

1195
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:19,424
I can't hear properly.

1196
01:51:21,509 --> 01:51:23,136
I'm going to bed.

1197
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:26,431
Don't stay up too late, you two.

1198
01:51:39,152 --> 01:51:41,571
Your mama told me what you did.

1199
01:51:45,158 --> 01:51:46,784
I shouldn't have.

1200
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,995
Maybe you had to.

1201
01:51:52,457 --> 01:51:54,834
I keep thinking about Max.

1202
01:51:55,752 --> 01:51:57,003
Wondering where he is.

1203
01:51:58,421 --> 01:52:00,006
Me, too.

1204
01:52:01,883 --> 01:52:04,010
I'm not sure what it all meant.

1205
01:52:05,428 --> 01:52:07,597
Everything he went through.

1206
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:10,266
Everything we did.

1207
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:15,772
We were just being people.

1208
01:52:16,981 --> 01:52:18,316
That's what people do.

1209
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:22,570
Liesel...

1210
01:52:23,696 --> 01:52:25,657
you are all grown up.

1211
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:35,667
<i>All I have learned is
that life makes no promises.</i>

1212
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,794
<i>So I had better get started.</i>

1213
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:41,005
<i>I have always
tried to ignore it...</i>

1214
01:52:41,339 --> 01:52:44,509
<i>but I know this all
started with a train...</i>

1215
01:52:46,302 --> 01:52:48,054
<i>and some snow...</i>

1216
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,682
<i>and my brother.</i>

1217
01:52:53,893 --> 01:52:57,605
<i>Outside the car, the world was
thrown inside a snow-shaker.</i>

1218
01:52:57,897 --> 01:52:59,941
Und <i>on a place
called Heaven Street...</i>

1219
01:53:00,108 --> 01:53:03,861
<i>a man with an accordion heart und
a woman cloaked in thunder...</i>

1220
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:05,655
<i>waited for their new daughter.</i>

1221
01:53:13,246 --> 01:53:17,250
<i>He lived under our stairs like
a quiet owl with no wings...</i>

1222
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:20,420
<i>until the sun forgot
what his face was.</i>

1223
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:29,095
<i>The book floated
down the river...</i>

1224
01:53:29,262 --> 01:53:33,057
<i>like a red fish being chased
by a yellow-haired boy.</i>

1225
01:53:43,318 --> 01:53:46,029
<i>For Max, who gave me eyes.</i>

1226
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,891
Good night, Your Majesty.

1227
01:54:26,152 --> 01:54:30,323
<i>I've always quite liked the
image of me with a sickle and cape.</i>

1228
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:33,034
<i>Dark and formidable.</i>

1229
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:37,455
<i>Unfortunately, I'm far more
ordinary and commonplace.</i>

1230
01:54:39,415 --> 01:54:43,336
<i>No one intended to destroy
a street named after Heaven.</i>

1231
01:54:44,087 --> 01:54:46,589
<i>It was a misread on a map.</i>

1232
01:54:46,756 --> 01:54:49,092
<i>No sirens that evening.</i>

1233
01:54:50,426 --> 01:54:52,804
<i>First were Rudy's brothers.</i>

1234
01:54:56,599 --> 01:54:59,143
<i>I read their simple dreams.</i>

1235
01:55:03,356 --> 01:55:05,900
<i>Then, I kissed his mother.</i>

1236
01:55:08,486 --> 01:55:12,407
<i>And stole the meanness
from Franz Deutscher's heart.</i>

1237
01:55:17,537 --> 01:55:20,289
<i>Rosa, I caught mid-snore.</i>

1238
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:24,544
<i>I could swear I heard
her call me a Saukerl.</i>

1239
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:30,383
<i>Then I felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart.</i>

1240
01:55:31,259 --> 01:55:36,222
<i>As for Hans, his soul was
lighter than a child's.</i>

1241
01:55:36,556 --> 01:55:40,476
<i>I felt his itch for one last
tune on his accordion...</i>

1242
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,521
<i>and heard his final thought...</i>

1243
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,108
<i>"Liesel."</i>

1244
01:56:40,244 --> 01:56:41,537
Over here!

1245
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:49,045
Just over.

1246
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:58,179
Your hand.

1247
01:57:11,067 --> 01:57:13,319
Mama? Papa?

1248
01:57:51,274 --> 01:57:52,608
Papa?

1249
01:57:58,406 --> 01:57:59,740
Papa.

1250
01:58:26,058 --> 01:58:27,310
Rudy?

1251
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:44,702
<i>Saumensch.</i>

1252
01:58:46,037 --> 01:58:47,204
Liesel.

1253
01:58:51,792 --> 01:58:53,002
I need to tell you...

1254
01:58:53,169 --> 01:58:54,629
Don't speak.

1255
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:57,381
I need to say it.

1256
01:59:01,886 --> 01:59:03,054
I...

1257
01:59:07,266 --> 01:59:08,434
Rudy?

1258
01:59:10,061 --> 01:59:11,228
Rudy, <i>nein.</i>

1259
01:59:12,271 --> 01:59:13,731
Rudy, wake up.

1260
01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:15,941
Rudy, <i>nein!</i>

1261
01:59:16,108 --> 01:59:18,778
Wake up, Rudy!
Rudy, wake up!

1262
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,113
Rudy, kiss me.

1263
01:59:26,744 --> 01:59:31,290
<i>Rudy, his soul
just rolled into my arms.</i>

1264
02:00:49,076 --> 02:00:53,539
<i>In my job, I am always finding
humans at their best...</i>

1265
02:00:53,998 --> 02:00:55,916
<i>and their worst.</i>

1266
02:00:56,083 --> 02:00:59,378
<i>I see their ugliness,
and their beauty...</i>

1267
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,924
<i>and I wonder how the
same thing can be both.</i>

1268
02:01:56,685 --> 02:01:57,728
Liesel!

1269
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:01,917
Max!

1270
02:03:14,638 --> 02:03:17,683
<i>I have seen a great many things.</i>

1271
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:21,186
<i>I've attended all the
world's worst disasters...</i>

1272
02:03:21,353 --> 02:03:24,315
<i>and worked for
the greatest of villains.</i>

1273
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:27,902
<i>And I've seen
the greatest wonders.</i>

1274
02:03:28,235 --> 02:03:31,071
<i>But it's still
like I said it was.</i>

1275
02:03:31,238 --> 02:03:33,949
<i>No one lives forever.</i>

1276
02:03:42,124 --> 02:03:45,127
<i>When I finally
came for Liesel...</i>

1277
02:03:45,294 --> 02:03:47,855
<i>I took selfish pleasure
in the knowledge</i>

1278
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,383
<i>that she had lived
her 90 years so wisely.</i>

1279
02:03:58,265 --> 02:04:02,394
<i>By then, her stories
had touched many souls.</i>

1280
02:04:02,561 --> 02:04:05,689
<i>Some of whom I came
to know in passing.</i>

1281
02:04:11,362 --> 02:04:16,533
<i>Max, whose friendship lasted
almost as long as Liesel.</i>

1282
02:04:17,409 --> 02:04:19,036
<i>Almost.</i>

1283
02:04:21,956 --> 02:04:23,999
<i>In her final thoughts...</i>

1284
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:28,545
<i>she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers.</i>

1285
02:04:29,296 --> 02:04:30,798
<i>Her three children.</i>

1286
02:04:30,965 --> 02:04:32,883
<i>Her grandchildren.</i>

1287
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:35,094
<i>Her husband.</i>

1288
02:04:35,678 --> 02:04:38,305
<i>Among them, lit like lanterns...</i>

1289
02:04:38,472 --> 02:04:40,724
<i>were Hans and Rosa...</i>

1290
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:42,267
<i>her brother...</i>

1291
02:04:42,434 --> 02:04:47,481
<i>and the boy whose hair remained
the color of lemons forever.</i>

1292
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,961
<i>I wanted to tell the book thief</i>

1293
02:04:51,986 --> 02:04:53,696
<i>she was one of the few souls...</i>

1294
02:04:53,862 --> 02:04:57,700
<i>that made me wonder
what it was to live.</i>

1295
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:01,870
<i>But in the end,
there were no words.</i>

1296
02:05:02,037 --> 02:05:03,789
<i>Only peace.</i>

1297
02:05:04,832 --> 02:05:07,876
<i>The only truth I truly know...</i>

1298
02:05:08,043 --> 02:05:12,673
<i>is that I am haunted by humans.</i>
