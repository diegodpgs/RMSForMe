00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,078
<i>The latest ceasefire came too late</i>
<i>to save these villages...</i>

2
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:27,587
<i>Today President Clinton voiced concerns</i>
<i>at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...</i>

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,597
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,</i>
<i>why do I hate all the Tutsi.</i>

4
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,536
<i>I say. "Read our history."</i>

5
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,541
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators</i>
<i>for the Belgian colonists.</i>

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,601
<i>They stole our Hutu land,</i>
<i>they whipped us.</i>

7
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,772
<i>Now they have come back,</i>
<i>these Tutsi rebels.</i>

8
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,113
<i>They are cockroaches.</i>
<i>They are murderers.</i>

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,781
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.</i>
<i>We are the majority.</i>

10
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,383
<i>They are a minority of traitors</i>
<i>and invaders.</i>

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,296
<i>We will squash the infestation.</i>
<i>We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

12
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,858
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

13
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,030
<i>Stay alert.</i>
<i>Watch your neighbors.</i>

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,951
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

15
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,197
Thank you.

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,675
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

17
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,736
Wonderful. Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello.

18
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,946
Good to see you gentlemen.

19
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,101
That is a fine cigar, sir.

20
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,506
This is a Cohiba cigar.

21
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,515
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?

22
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,882
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

23
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,580
What do you mean, sir?

24
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,387
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

25
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,398
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

26
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,165
straight from Havana, Cuba...
Hey, that is style, Dube.

27
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,030
Style.

28
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,974
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar.

29
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,183
The best, eh?

30
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,916
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

31
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,824
I will try my best, George,

32
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,489
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

33
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,966
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

34
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,400
And money.

35
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,901
It's time for you
to join your people.

36
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,741
Thank you, George.

37
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,604
But time is also money.

38
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,783
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

39
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,683
along with the regular order.

40
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,486
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

41
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,692
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

42
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,031
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

43
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,869
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

44
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,643
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,481
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra.

46
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,542
Thank you.

47
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,620
A bargain buy from China--
ten cents each.

48
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,063
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

49
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,030
At least.

50
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,001
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

51
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,910
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

52
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,408
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

53
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,749
Their time is soon over.

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,788
Anyway, this is business.

55
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,391
- Oh, no. It's the hterhamwe.
- Do as they say. Pull over.

56
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,644
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

57
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,712
Smile, Dube. Don't attract
attention to yourself.

58
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,692
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,285
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

60
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,599
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

61
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,001
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,769
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power, Hutu power!

63
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,939
Okay. Yes!

64
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,580
Get out of here.

65
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,883
There's water coming from the box.

66
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,122
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

67
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,797
Gregoire, please help with this water.

68
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,300
Gregoire!

69
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,999
Deal with this right away.

70
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,201
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

71
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,143
Dube, this is the lobby.

72
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,842
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

73
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,883
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

74
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,486
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

75
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,190
All right.

76
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,997
But save the shells.

77
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,558
Fill them with...

78
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,667
...a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,506
- Cassava?
- And...the fish.

80
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,772
- And tipali.
- Yes.

81
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,612
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

82
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,672
Dube.

83
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,150
Style, sir.

84
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,686
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,620
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

86
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:13,893
that the hterhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

87
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,527
Colonel, the U.N. need not worry
about the hterhamwe.

88
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,831
We will control them.

89
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,066
- General.
- Paul.

90
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,233
This scotch is exceptional.

91
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,075
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

92
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,011
Colonel Oliver,
it is a pleasure to see you, sir.

93
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,072
Good to see you, Paul.

94
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,676
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

95
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,722
It is spectacular--
straight off the plane.

96
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,690
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

97
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,748
Thank you.

98
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,728
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

99
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,230
Excuse me, gentlemen.

100
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,631
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

101
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,264
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

102
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,370
Good afternoon, ladies.

103
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,004
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,377
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,775
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

106

Hello, Mr. Paul.

113
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,147
Hello, Jeremiah.

114
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,818
Hello, sir.

115
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,290
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

116
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,525
See you soon.

117
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,564
So your brother
and the girls are here.

118
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,835
Yes.

119
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,067
One, two, three...

120
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,009
Oh, Carine!

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,648
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,148
One, two, three...

123
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,116
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

124
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,951
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

125
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,150
Hey, Papa, watch this.

126
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,625
Oh, my goodness. Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

127
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,393
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

128
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,561
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

129
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,764
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

130
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,101
Let's go in.

131
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,510
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,747
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

133
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,618
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

134
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,215
- What?
- There are soldiers.

135
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,852
- Where?
- On the street.

136
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,765
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

137
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,664
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

138
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,142
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

139
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,975
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

140
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,073
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any...

141
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,384
- What is it?
- Shut up!

142
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,115
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

143
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,157
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

144
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,086
No, Captain, you see--

145
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,290
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, Captain.

146
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,926
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

147
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,436
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi fuckers.

148
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,072
No! No!

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,471
We must do something.

150
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,236
- Do what?
- Call someone.

151
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,211
I'm not going. I'm not going.

152
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,303
No!

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,515
Get him in the truck. Now!

154
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,318
We must do something.

155
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,451
Please help him!

156
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,961
Oh, Victor!

157
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,519
Victor!

158
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,463
There is nothing we can do.

159
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,334
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

160
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,137
No!

161
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,036
Why would they arrest Victor?

162
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,146
He has no politics.

163
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,748
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

164
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,081
Who knows?

165
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,057
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

166
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,123
Happens all the time now.

167
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:44,093
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

168
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,361
It wouldn't help.

169
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,770
You could ask as a favor.

170
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,003
No, I could not.

171
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:58,146
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

172
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,085
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favors

173
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,782
so if there is a time
when <i>we</i> need help,

174
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,916
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

175
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,324
But Victor was a good neighbor.

176
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,695
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,565
Please, please,
leave these things to my good judgment.

178
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,686
This assignment is bullshit.

179
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,817
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

180
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,496
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Mille Collines.

181
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,795
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

182
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,699
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,965
Anything that you need,
please find me.

184
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,403
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

185
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,042
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

186
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,521
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

187
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,558
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

188
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,116
How?

189
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,527
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

190
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,656
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

191
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,258
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

192
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,667
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

193
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,002
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

194
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,337
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

195
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,206
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

196
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,611
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

197
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,979
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

198
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,052
So what are you, Paul?

199
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,952
I am Hutu.

200
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
Gentlemen.

201
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:53,656
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

202
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,031
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

203
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,539
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

204
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,441
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

205
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,511
They could be twins.

206
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,245
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

207
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,308
Okay.

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,590
I'm in room 22. I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

209
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,557
<i>Senior U.N. officers claim that</i>
<i>the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

210
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,897
<i>and arming the Hutu militia</i>
<i>called the hterhamwe.</i>

211
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:34,406
<i>I put this claim to the head</i>
<i>of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.</i>

212
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,170
<i>No. No, we have not been</i>
<i>training the militia.</i>

213
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,235
<i>The U.N. are mistaken</i>
<i>in this accusation.</i>

214
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,906
<i>Do you support your president's</i>
<i>agreement to make peace with the rebels?</i>

215
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>The president has</i>
<i>the full support of the army.</i>

216
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,510
<i>That peace agreement will</i>
<i>be signed today in Tanzania</i>

217
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,955
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces</i>
<i>and President Habyarimana.</i>

218
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,823
This is a great day for Rwanda

219
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,829
and for all of Africa.

220
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,559
Negotiation has replaced confrontation...

221
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,101
Paul, have a drink.

222
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,999
Friendship has replaced fear.

223
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,334
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

224
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,271
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

225
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,799
To our president.
May he find peace.

226
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,541
May we all find peace.

227
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:21,314
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

228
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,649
To peace!

229
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,847
Peace!

230
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,459
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

231
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,053
I am planning on returning there as--
Forgive me.

232
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,224
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

233
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,333
- Hello, Fedens.
- Paul.

234
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,599
Well, this is a surprise.

235
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,073
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

236
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,911
Yes, what's wrong?

237
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,811
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

238
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,007
Who?

239
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,917
Thank you, Sullivan.

240
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,586
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man.

241
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,717
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

242
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,328
Give me this man's name.

243
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,991
Please, Paul, even though
he is hterhamwe, he's a friend.

244
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,864
He wants your job, Thomas.

245
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,137
He said that
there is a signal.

246
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,835
It is "Cut the tall trees."

247
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,672
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

248
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,686
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

249
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,722
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

250
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,826
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

251
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,786
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

252
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,594
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

253
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,227
The world press are watching.

254
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,136
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work--

255
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,764
What was that?

256
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,343
Power cuts.

257
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,842
We are running on generators.

258
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,785
Fedens...

259
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,480
Please, don't worry.

260
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,392
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

261
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,791
All right?

262
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,491
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

263
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,293
Shit!

264
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,414
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

265
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,608
Everybody stay in your house!

266
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,441
Tatiana?

267
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,541
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

268
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,812
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

269
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,719
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

270
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,087
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

271
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,956
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

272
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,485
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

273
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,497
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

274
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,561
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

275
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,436
Odette, please.

276
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,940
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes. I told them to go home.

277
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,510
- Go and call them, Tatsi.
- I've tried. Our phones, they do not work.

278
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,883
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

279
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,553
You are a Tutsi.

280
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,928
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

281
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,072
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

282
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,975
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

283
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,005
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

284
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,346
Gone? Gone where?

285
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,115
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.
- Where has he gone, Elys?

286
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,314
He went next door.

287
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,055
Wait. Paul!

288
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,151
Tatiana, no. You have to
stay here with the children.

289
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,129
- Stay in the house. No!
- Please.

290
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,497
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

291
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,544
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,739
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

293
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,872
Paul?

294
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,677
Oh, Tatsi.

295
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,045
Odette, Odette!

296
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,112
Oh, no.

297
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,624
I'm okay.

298
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,092
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

299
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,391
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

300
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,864
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

301
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,626
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

302
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,266
Where is he hurt?

303
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,932
Look here, Odette, look here.

304
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,637
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

305
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,039
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

306
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,514
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

307
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,744
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

308
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,251
Roger, you're okay.

309
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,086
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

310
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,591
This is not his blood, Paul.

311
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,258
You are not hurt.

312
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,787
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

313
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,731
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

314
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,860
Come here, Elys.

315
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,428
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

316
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,275
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

317
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,073
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

318
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,841
It's okay.

319
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,075
I love you so much.
I love you.

320
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,231
Oh, son.

321
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,141
Paul.

322
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,739
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.</i>
<i>Terrible news...</i>

323
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,808
- It is true.
- <i>Horrible news...</i>

324
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,584
<i>Our great president</i>
<i>is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

325
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,646
Oh, my God!

326
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,559
<i>They tricked him to sign</i>
<i>their phony peace agreement.</i>

327
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,256
<i>Then they shot his plane</i>
<i>from the sky.</i>

328
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,601
<i>It is time to clear the brush,</i>
<i>good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

329
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,537
<i>We must cut the tall trees.</i>

330
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,041
<i>Cut the tall trees now!</i>

331
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,601
The soldiers are here!

332
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,648
- <i>Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.</i>
- No, no.

333
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,275
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

334
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:10,811
<i>Find these traitors.</i>
<i>Let none of them escape.</i>

335
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,453
Split up.
Everybody out.

336
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,029
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

337
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,132
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,376
I better go have a word with them.

339
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,440
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

340
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,538
Yes, sir!

341
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,311
Who's in charge here?

342
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,545
You.

343
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,393
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

344
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,363
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

345
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,491
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

346
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,659
Get out!

347
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,172
Get out of here!

348
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

349
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,233
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

350
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,575
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

351
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,080
I used to work at the Diplomat.

352
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,881
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

353
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,388
You must open it.
Let's go.

354
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,018
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

355
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,789
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

356
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,058
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

357
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,759
I cannot take all these people.

358
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,825
No, no, sir,
you do not have to.

359
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,700
We have our car
and our van.

360
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,468
- <i>Captain Kaliso, come on.</i>
- Roger.

361
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:41,002
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

362
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,377
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

363
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,149
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

364
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,987
Oh, Jesus, no!

365
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,423
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

366
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,699
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
Don't look, Tatiana.

367
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,004
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

368
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,714
Look at this. Beer.

369
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,129
I've got them.

370
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,304
Get down, all of you!

371
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:07,214
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

372
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,727
Traitor!

373
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,766
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

374
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,868
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

375
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,333
Shoot them.

376
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,937
Shoot them.

377
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,374
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

378
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,438
It's easy.

379
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,755
Shoot them, or you die first.

380
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:45,357
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

381
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,261
You wanna pay me?

382
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,732
Why not?
Look at them.

383
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,598
These are not rebels.

384
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:56,062
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

385
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,769
- How much?
- You name a price.

386
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,347
10,000 francs for each.

387
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,916
- Sir, I don't have that much.
- Okay.

388
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,958
Wait, wait! Here.

389
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,461
It's 1,000 U.S.
And here.

390
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,996
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

391
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,296
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

392
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,768
Go, go, go.

393
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,737
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

394
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,037
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

395
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,947
Sir, I have more money actually.

396
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,184
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

397
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,415
All right?

398
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,120
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

399
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,127
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

400
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,296
Here you are. See?

401
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,197
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

402
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,003
Sir...

403
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,512
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

404
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,452
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

405
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,511
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

406
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,057
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U.N.

407
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,789
Sir, I swear.
100,000 francs.

408
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,390
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

409
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,163
Please, sir. Please.

410
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,063
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

411
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,939
Come on now. Hurry.

412
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,455
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

413
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,861
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

414
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,266
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you--

415
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,980
Here's the money.

416
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,541
100,000 francs as promised.

417
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,587
Now please, let them go, sir.

418
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,885
Take the money.
We will get them later.

419
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,921
- You can go.
- Thank you.

420
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,124
Traitor.

421
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,998
Thank you, Paul.

422
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,343
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

423
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,779
- You must tell him when he comes--
- Here he is, sir.

424
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:56,344
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

425
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,390
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

426
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,583
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,424
<i>There were no survivors in last night's</i>
<i>plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

428
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,328
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

429
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,729
Come, Tatsi.

430
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,299
Andre, I need two suites.

431
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,669
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

432
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,938
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

433
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,975
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbors?

434
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,707
What will they do?

435
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,620
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

436
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:38,659
Please...put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

437
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,197
Right away, sir.

438
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,034
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

439
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,609
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

440
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,545
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

441
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,984
This mess is unacceptable.

442
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,114
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

443
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,423
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

444
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,622
Operator, I need a line.

445
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,567
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

446
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,535
You did not reach them?

447
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,805
No. No answer.

448
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,977
<i>It is a very tense situation,</i>
<i>and I just want to assure the families</i>

449
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,179
<i>of those who are there that we are</i>
<i>doing everything we possibly can</i>

450
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,814
<i>to try to ensure</i>
<i>the safety of our citizens there.</i>

451
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,120
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

452
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,888
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

453
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,522
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

454
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,497
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

455
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,898
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

456
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,170
Dube, where is Gregoire?

457
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,043
Sir, he has moved
into the Presidential Suite.

458
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,887
Mr. Manager.

459
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,855
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

460
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,297
Who is it?

461
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,501
It's okay, darling.

462
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,634
What do you want?

463
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,231
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

464
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,573
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

465
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,841
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

466
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:47,483
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

467
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,053
If I were to leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

468
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,321
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

469
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,298
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

470
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,503
Are you used to the smell?

471
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,407
Well, not me.

472
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,744
I need a clean room
to escape it.

473
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,786
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

474
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,155
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

475
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,818
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

476
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,125
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

477
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:30,031
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.

478
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,729
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

479
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,271
There are eight of us.

480
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,896
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

481
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,133
Yes, Madame Archer.

482
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,449
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

483
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,680
Okay, come on, let's go.

484
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,221
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

485
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,993
Come.

486
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,461
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

487
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,500
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly.

488
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,605
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

489
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,040
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

490
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,546
Madame Archer.

491
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,377
I have a favor to ask of you.

492
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,976
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St. Francis.

493
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,146
On O'Clare, 20.

494
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,214
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

495
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,316
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

496
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,024
Please, keep moving!

497
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,395
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,334
Please move into the hotel!

499
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,031
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

500
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,802
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

501
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,115
Has he spoken to you yet?

502
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,173
No.

503
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,957
Is your face still hurting?

504
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,162
It's all right.

505
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,439
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

506
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,241
I shouldn't have brought them here.

507
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,585
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

508
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,489
was to never, never lower
the tone of the hotel.

509
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,794
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul."

510
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,592
Soon all of this will be over.

511
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,266
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

512
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,302
Oh, my God!

513
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,573
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

514
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,601
Take care of them.

515
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,000
How, sir?

516
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,830
Bathe them, feed them.

517
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,574
Put them to bed.

518
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,341
I will send you some help.

519
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,949
Okay, babies.

520
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,553
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

521
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,116
Will the U.N. intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

522
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,322
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

523
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,025
My orders are
not to intervene.

524
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,901
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

525
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,695
Here. Over here.

526
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,899
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

527
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,234
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

528
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,711
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

529
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,908
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

530
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,144
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

531
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,050
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

532
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:15,115
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

533
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,626
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

534
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,562
Let's go.

535
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,263
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

536
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,205
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

537
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,710
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

538
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,837
This is not a refugee camp.

539
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,108
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

540
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,447
No, I can't do that, Paul.
I'm sorry.

541
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,083
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

542
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,750
I'm under attack, constant attack.

543
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,727
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

544
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:59,364
<i>...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches</i>
<i>who try to run from justice.</i>

545
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,965
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge</i>
<i>called Makesa is hiding at 4...</i>

546
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,944
- <i>...Kabulla and his cockroaches...</i>
- Turn that radio off.

547
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,444
<i>Watch out for him. He--</i>

548
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,619
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

549
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,887
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

550
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,655
I am your boss!

551
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,068
<i>Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines</i>
<i>in Rwanda on line one.</i>

552
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,706
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

553
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,977
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

554
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,146
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr. Tillens.

555
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,986
Ah, yes. Paul, I remember.

556
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,821
How are things there?

557
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,191
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

558
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,727
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

559
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,826
until this unrest is over.

560
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,532
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

561
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:16,274
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

562
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,613
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

563
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,915
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

564
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,082
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

565
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,492
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

566
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,497
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

567
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,864
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

568
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,994
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

569
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,935
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

570
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,909
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

571
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,043
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

572
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,850
for you to perform your duties?

573
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,419
In fact, forget this letter.

574
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,558
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

575
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,401
Please, everyone, back to work.

576
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,241
Paul, thank you for coming.

577
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,845
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

578
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,786
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

579
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,055
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

580
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,620
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

581
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,132
Thank you, Paul.

582
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,699
You're an oasis in the desert.

583
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,266
<i>...the elements of</i>
<i>the government and army</i>

584
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,072
<i>are following the example of what</i>
<i>happened to the Americans in Somalia.</i>

585
00:41:54,144 --> 00:42:00,014
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,</i>
<i>try to attack us, and...</i>

586
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,713
<i>hope that the West</i>
<i>will pull all its troops out.</i>

587
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,187
- <i>Do you think they'll succeed?</i>
- <i>No, they won't.</i>

588
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,656
<i>The U.N.'s here to stay.</i>

589
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,386
<i>What about</i>
<i>the outbreak of violence</i>

590
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,428
<i>since the shooting down</i>
<i>of the president's plane?</i>

591
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,293
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

592
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,425
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

593
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,301
What is this?

594
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,235
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

595
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,635
Fred, it's David.

596
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,540
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

597
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,306
Dead bodies, machetes.

598
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,507
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

599
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,575
Yeah.

600
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,551
You have to lead with this.

601
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,852
I point at you, you do a shot.

602
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,921
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking--

603
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,024
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

604
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,862
Listen, sorry about earlier.

605
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,566
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have--

606
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:35,442
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

607
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,606
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

608
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:46,219
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

609
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,928
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

610
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,365
I think if people see this footage...

611
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,062
...they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

612
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,968
and then go on
eating their dinners.

613
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,873
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

614
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,609
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

615
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,913
Please enjoy your evening,
Mr. Daglish.

616
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,891
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

617
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,984
We've got trouble at the gate.

618
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,358
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

619
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,630
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

620
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,933
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

621
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,031
Benedict, what is happening?

622
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,043
They're killing everyone.
The lady...

623
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,875
The hterhamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

624
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,107
Come on!

625
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,640
Cover the road. Now.

626
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,077
Stand your ground.

627
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,047
Hold the line.

628
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,489
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

629
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,681
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,158
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

631
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:33,390
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers.

632
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,898
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

633
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,093
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

634
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:43,098
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

635
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,663
They'll be here in a few days.

636
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,439
I understand that, Colonel, but there is
simply no place for me to put all of them.

637
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,877
What can I do?

638
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,314
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants.

639
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,550
- All right.
- All right.

640
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,416
I understand. Thank you.

641
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,493
Madame Archer.

642
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,859
Hello.

643
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,165
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

644
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,730
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

645
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,538
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

646
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,171
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

647
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,577
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

648
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,678
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

649
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,313
Okay.

650
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,153
But...

651
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:39,628
My brother and his wife--
did the old lady know of them?

652
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,769
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

653
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:50,364
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

654
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,935
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

655
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,743
I can't. There are
hterhamwe roadblocks everywhere.

656
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,477
When I reached the orphanage...

657
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,690
...the hterhamwe were there.

658
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,492
They'd already started
killing children.

659
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,890
They made me watch.

660
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,825
There was one girl,

661
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,530
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

662
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,503
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me.

663
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,005
"Please don't let them kill me.

664
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,946
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

665
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,784
Please, I can't.

666
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,328
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

667
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,906
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

668
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,440
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

669
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,612
We will get the orphans out then.

670
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,862
They're here!

671
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,608
They're here! We are safe!

672
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,008
Soldiers have arrived!

673
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,274
- Wow, look, it's the French!
- Yes!

674
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,179
Thank goodness!

675
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,619
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

676
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,847
Well done.

677
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,759
About time, gentlemen.

678
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,961
Thank you for saving our lives.

679
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,529
It's okay, Roger.

680
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,638
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

681
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,471
Yes, finally!

682
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,144
See, it's okay.

683
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,712
We can do nothing
from our side.

684
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,583
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

685
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,455
See? I told you. Yeah.

686
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,727
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

687
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,094
Something strong.

688
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,168
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

689
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,204
Congratulations, Colonel.

690
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,536
You have performed a minor miracle.

691
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,478
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

692
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,888
You should spit in my face.

693
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,285
Excuse me, Colonel?

694
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,157
You're dirt.

695
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,296
We think you're dirt, Paul.

696
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,299
Who is "we"?

697
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,669
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

698
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,971
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

699
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,568
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

700
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,943
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

701
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,780
You're the smartest man here.

702
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,812
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

703
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,790
You could own this freakin' hotel,
except for one thing--

704
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,190
you're black.

705
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,753
You're not even a nigger.

706
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,624
You're an African.

707
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,070
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

708
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,103
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

709
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:51,740
Please.

710
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,508
Got it.

711
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,678
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

712
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,623
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

713
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,091
What is it?

714
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,230
All the whites are leaving.

715
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,102
They are being evacuated.

716
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,041
But...what about us?

717
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,679
We have been abandoned.

718
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,739
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

719
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,251
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

720
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,550
I said all the whites are leaving--
the French, the Italians,

721
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,216
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

722
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,895
Who is left?

723
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,162
I don't know.

724
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:49,032
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country.

725
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,137
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

726
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,573
And they are not allowed to shoot.

727
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,251
I am a fool.

728
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,517
No. No, no.

729
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,260
They told me
I was one of them, and I...

730
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:18,524
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style--
I swallowed it.

731
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,866
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

732
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,240
And they handed me their shit.

733
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,704
I have no history.
I have no memory.

734
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,285
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

735
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,013
You are no fool.

736
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,654
I know who you are.

737
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,091
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

738
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,899
<i>A United Nations source reports</i>
<i>that the U.S. and British representatives</i>

739
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,599
<i>on the Security Council</i>
<i>will lobby for the removal</i>

740
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,268
<i>of all U.N. peacekeepers</i>
<i>from Rwanda.</i>

741
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,765
Please, Jack.
Please don't go.

742
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,766
Wait, he's British.
Take out your passport.

743
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,500
Jack, please don't leave me.

744
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,635
Can we talk?
Just one second.

745
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,533
Please, Jack. Please.

746
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,205
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

747
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,816
Here. Now just take...

748
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,053
- Take this.
- No, no...

749
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,350
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

750
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,017
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

751
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,787
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

752
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,849
Paul.

753
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,359
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

754
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,424
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

755
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,833
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

756
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,838
We have to let him go.

757
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,014
Don't do that, please.

758
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,074
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

759
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,255
Wait! Wait!

760
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,801
Hold the buses!

761
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,066
Peter!

762
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,453
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

763
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,582
- No Rwandans.
- What?

764
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,492
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

765
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,156
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

766
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,722
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

767
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,631
Father, it is of no use.

768
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:09,035
These men are not here--
They are not here to help us.

769
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,766
Please, there is nothing we can do.

770
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,001
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

771
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,067
It is of no use, Father.
Please, hurry.

772
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,540
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

773
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,245
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

774
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,449
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

775
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,155
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

776
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,696
Go inside.

777
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,791
Go inside the hotel,
all of you.

778
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,200
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

779
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,102
Go into the hotel.

780
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,568
No!

781
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,446
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

782
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,696
Excuse me. Excuse me.

783
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,236
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

784
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,368
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

785
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,414
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

786
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,176
Paul.

787
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,925
I want you to go.

788
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,726
Go where?

789
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,530
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

790
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,764
- Your card says Hutu--
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,240
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

792
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,243
I want you to go.

793
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,972
No, Tatiana, no.

794
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,010
I will never leave you.

795
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,680
I will never leave you.

796
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,653
Oh, Tatsi.

797
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,831
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

798
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:06,945
Get up. Get up.

799
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,779
Get up, get up, get up.

800
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,416
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

801
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,123
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

802
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,389
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

803
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,760
It's an order.

804
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:27,259
I need some time--
20, 30 minutes--to take a shower.

805
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,936
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

806
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:38,007
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

807
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,141
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

808
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:44,209
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

809
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,483
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

810
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,584
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

811
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:52,821
Under the bed.

812
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,662
Roger. It's Papa.

813
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,633
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

814
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,999
Come, come. Come on.

815
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,570
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

816
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,908
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

817
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,504
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.
- The roof?

818
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,777
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now.

819
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,146
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

820
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,118
He is where?

821
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,249
No, that is unacceptable.

822
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,987
Who would order such a thing?

823
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,395
Yes, did you find the general?

824
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,301
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

825
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,963
Get me the guest list.

826
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,401
Yes, sir.

827
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,167
Yes?

828
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,182
<i>Sorry, sir, but I have a call</i>
<i>from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.</i>

829
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,184
Paul, are you all right?

830
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,776
<i>We have a big problem, sir.</i>

831
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:51,945
What?

832
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,148
The Hutu army have come.

833
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,783
They've ordered us--
all of us--out of the hotel.

834
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,622
Why are they doing this?

835
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,163
I think they will kill us all.

836
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,219
Kill?

837
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:07,529
What do you mean...all?
How many?

838
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:12,473
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

839
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,533
- 800?!
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

840
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,808
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi</i>
<i>and Hutu refugees.</i>

841
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,440
I do not have much time left, sir.

842
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,085
I want to thank you

843
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,453
<i>for everything that you</i>
<i>have done for me and my family,</i>

844
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,652
<i>and please thank all</i>
<i>of my friends at Sabena.</i>

845
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,720
Paul, wait.

846
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,062
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

847
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,000
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

848
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:45,370
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

849
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,937
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

850
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,445
Did you need something, sir?

851
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,916
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

852
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,110
Okay.

853
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,214
Paul, are you there?

854
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,047
Yes, sir.

855
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,855
Who can I call to stop this?

856
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,457
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

857
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:15,602
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

858
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:22,100
What are you doing, Dube?

859
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,113
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

860
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,380
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

861
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,785
Thank you.

862
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,023
Come with me, please.

863
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,825
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

864
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,595
Here you are, sir.

865
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,875
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

866
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,736
What is this?

867
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,174
It is the guest list, sir.

868
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,280
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

869
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:11,452
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

870
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:15,019
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

871
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:20,466
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

872
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,305
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

873
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:29,072
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

874
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,978
then I'll kill everyone in there.

875
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,973
Starting with you.

876
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,276
Leave.

877
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,747
Yes, sir.

878
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,401
Yes, sir.

879
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,231
Who did you call?

880
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,738
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

881
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,136
What is your name?

882
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,545
Rusesabagina.

883
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,584
Paul Rusesabagina.

884
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,951
I'll remember you.

885
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,621
I'll remember you.

886
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:19,322
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

887
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:29,860
They've gone.

888
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,608
Paul. Paul.

889
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,271
I was afraid for you.

890
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,279
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

891
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,589
I must talk with this man.

892
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,159
- Mr. Tillens.
- <i>Paul, what's going on?</i>

893
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,565
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

894
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,729
I got through to the French
president's office.

895
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,306
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

896
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,774
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

897
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,344
<i>I am afraid this is not</i>
<i>going to happen.</i>

898
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,511
They're cowards, Paul.

899
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:25,155
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

900
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,497
The French, the British,
the Americans.

901
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,261
I am sorry, Paul.

902
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,629
Thank you.

903
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,902
There will be no rescue...

904
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,336
...no intervention for us.

905
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,214
We can only save ourselves.

906
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,579
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

907
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,144
You must call these people.

908
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,248
Please, fax this
to this number. Thank you.

909
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,055
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

910
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,220
Say good-bye.

911
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,930
But when you say good-bye,

912
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:12,168
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

913
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,771
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

914
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,370
...you will die.

915
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:26,449
We must shame them
into sending help.

916
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:33,851
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

917
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,026
The hterhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

918
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,797
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

919
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,805
Have you printed the bills?

920
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,799
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

921
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,903
- Erase it?
- Yes. I want no names to appear there.

922
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,582
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

923
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,379
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

924
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,477
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

925
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,991
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

926
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,727
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

927
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,202
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

928
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,810
<i>Does the State Department</i>
<i>have a view</i>

929
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:26,075
<i>as to whether or not</i>
<i>what is happening could be genocide?</i>

930
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,549
<i>We have every reason to believe</i>
<i>that acts of genocide have occurred.</i>

931
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:34,351
<i>How many acts of genocide</i>
<i>does it take to make genocide?</i>

932
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:37,449
<i>Alan, that's just not a question</i>
<i>that I'm in a position to answer.</i>

933
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:41,087
<i>Is it true that you</i>
<i>have specific guidance</i>

934
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,654
<i>not to use the word "genocide"</i>
<i>in isolation,</i>

935
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,327
<i>but always to preface it</i>
<i>with this word "acts of"?</i>

936
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:52,933
<i>I have guidance</i>
<i>which I try to use as best as I can.</i>

937
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,567
<i>I have--</i>

938
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,077
<i>There are formulations</i>
<i>that we are using</i>

939
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:00,138
<i>that we are trying to be</i>
<i>consistent in our use of--</i>

940
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,549
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

941
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,315
As long as it is scotch.

942
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,356
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

943
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,759
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

944
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:21,132
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

945
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,138
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

946
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,400
To protect us, sir.

947
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,466
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

948
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,809
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

949
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,282
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

950
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,841
would be well rewarded.

951
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,184
I will see what I can do.

952
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,017
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

953
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,522
Where has all our beer gone?

954
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,259
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

955
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,364
How much beer?

956
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,393
Many.

957
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:59,707
...come down to the reception.
And then he says to me,

958
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,402
"How do you want the girls?"

959
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,314
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

960
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,181
General...

961
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,653
I'm glad you came by.

962
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,894
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

963
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,190
What did you overhear?

964
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:25,529
It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel
and an American Embassy official.

965
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,000
And what did they say?

966
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:29,902
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

967
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,530
How? They have gone, Paul.

968
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,701
With their spies. Satellites.

969
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,044
Americans.

970
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,015
Oh, Gregoire!

971
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,720
You know, I admire you, General.

972
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,221
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

973
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,058
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

974
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,363
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

975
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,095
He won't work,
listens to no one.

976
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,763
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

977
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:03,827
Yes.

978
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,744
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

979
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,553
Satellites?

980
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,215
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

981
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:40,072
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

982
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:44,078
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

983
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,273
No. No, no.

984
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,179
I have to, Tatiana.

985
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,878
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

986
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,614
You cannot go alone.

987
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,152
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

988
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:00,457
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

989
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,467
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

990
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,601
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

991
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,309
We have a job this morning.

992
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,712
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

993
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,115
Please get the van.

994
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,361
Show me your I.D.

995
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,931
<i>Remember how those Tutsi women</i>
<i>used to look down</i>

996
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,035
<i>their long noses at Hutu men?</i>
<i>Now they beg for their lives.</i>

997
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,637
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

998
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:57,084
<i>I say taste those</i>
<i>Tutsi whores before they die.</i>

999
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:00,679
<i>Then they'll know</i>
<i>what Hutu power is, my warriors.</i>

1000
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,522
<i>Remember, one cockroach</i>
<i>can start an infestation.</i>

1001
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,061
<i>We need to exterminate these vermin.</i>

1002
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,159
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

1003
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,558
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

1004
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,898
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

1005
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,573
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

1006
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,811
Yes. I need rice, beans,

1007
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:06,286
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey.

1008
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,948
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

1009
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,584
You have no whiskey?

1010
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,357
No whiskey, no spirits.

1011
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:20,164
Your...rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

1012
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:24,261
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now.

1013
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,898
What are you saying, George?

1014
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:32,572
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,
their money is no good to them anymore.

1015
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,645
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

1016
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,485
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

1017
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,257
And why not?

1018
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,486
Why not?

1019
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,054
We are halfway there already.

1020
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,735
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

1021
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,533
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

1022
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,098
Yes, sir, right away.

1023
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:08,446
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

1024
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,044
Yes.

1025
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,518
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

1026
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:18,683
And put those in the van. You.

1027
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,286
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

1028
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:25,094
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

1029
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,362
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here."

1030
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:31,702
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

1031
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:37,173
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

1032
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,489
Let's go.

1033
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,419
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

1034
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,363
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

1035
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,864
Now, if we were to get them,

1036
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:03,735
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

1037
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,073
Do you understand?

1038
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,944
It is almost dawn, George.

1039
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,107
We really must be going.

1040
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:19,081
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

1041
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,370
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

1042
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,675
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

1043
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,580
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

1044
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:14,830
Back up the car, Gregoire.

1045
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:17,898
Listen to me.

1046
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,671
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

1047
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,143
No one, Gregoire.

1048
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:44,455
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

1049
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,199
Oh, dear.

1050
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,596
Oh, God!

1051
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,033
Oh, God!

1052
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,572
- Sir.
- Dube!

1053
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:04,510
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

1054
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,570
I'll be out in a minute.

1055
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,682
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

1056
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,383
Don't come in. I'll be out.

1057
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:48,951
Hundreds.

1058
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,786
It was too many to count.

1059
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,800
Why are people so cruel?

1060
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:04,932
Hatred.

1061
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,239
Insanity. I don't know.

1062
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:14,973
There you go.

1063
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,348
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1064
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,319
Oh, yes.

1065
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,980
...to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

1066
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,457
I remember...

1067
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,289
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

1068
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,057
- Hello.
- Come with me.

1069
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,000
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

1070
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,182
It's beautiful.

1071
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,450
You like it?

1072
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,332
I hear we must pay for everything.

1073
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,891
Yes, this is true.

1074
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,696
So...how much for this?

1075
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,199
A kiss.

1076
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:32,891
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina.

1077
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,170
I have a confession.

1078
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,239
When you worked as the nurse...

1079
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,478
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

1080
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,577
When we first met...

1081
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,647
I had you transferred to Kigali.

1082
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,325
What?

1083
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:12,790
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

1084
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,263
- Why?
- To be closer.

1085
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,469
So that I could marry you.

1086
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,479
What was the bribe?

1087
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,449
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

1088
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,355
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

1089
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,294
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1090
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,229
I want to know.

1091
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,392
A Volkswagen.

1092
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,738
I hope it was a new one.

1093
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,996
We have had a good life,
you and I. Yes.

1094
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:29,569
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

1095
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,519
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

1096
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,381
Our children cannot
see us die first.

1097
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,860
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

1098
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,591
- Please, I don't want to--
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

1099
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,600
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

1100
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,803
If I do not make it,

1101
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,670
you must take all of our children
by the hand...

1102
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,775
...and you must jump.

1103
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:09,180
- What are you saying? I could never--
- You have to, Tatiana.

1104
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,014
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

1105
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:15,386
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

1106
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,186
I cannot do--

1107
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,022
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

1108
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,687
Promise me you will do it.

1109
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,164
Please, Tatiana.

1110
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,465
Yes.

1111
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,038
I'm sorry. I love you.

1112
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,110
I love you.

1113
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,478
I'm gonna get you!

1114
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,915
Diane, Elys, you know better.

1115
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,518
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

1116
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,894
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

1117
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,930
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

1118
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,901
Paul, I've got good news.

1119
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:12,641
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

1120
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,514
I have exit visas
for the following families.

1121
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:19,781
Abukesu, Tanzania.

1122
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:22,846
Bidori, Kenya.

1123
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,852
Gituaranga, Zambia.

1124
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,691
Hallelujah!

1125
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,424
Khalesa, Belgium.

1126
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,658
Oh, thank you!

1127
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,233
Dakuzi...

1128
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,066
Kenya.

1129
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,703
Masambo, Zambia.

1130
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,275
Zinguru, Ghana.

1131
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,405
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

1132
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,150
All right, that's it.

1133
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,611
So remember,
families be ready at 7 a.m.

1134
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:55,951
Let's go.

1135
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,082
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

1136
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,354
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

1137
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,261
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

1138
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:07,993
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

1139
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:09,058
Excuse me.

1140
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,633
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

1141
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:15,698
Yeah.

1142
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:20,247
The girls--
Paul, I will not leave without them.

1143
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,589
What have you brought us?

1144
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:34,992
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

1145
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:36,553
Thank you.

1146
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,122
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

1147
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,929
Are you on the list?

1148
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:49,138
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

1149
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,376
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1150
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,439
and bring the girls
back here to us?

1151
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,476
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

1152
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,752
They're probably dead.

1153
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:08,159
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

1154
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,423
I'll try.

1155
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,662
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

1156
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,265
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

1157
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,003
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

1158
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:31,208
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

1159
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:35,017
I will find someone.
I promise you.

1160
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,385
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1161
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,300
Come on, take my hand.

1162
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:52,236
<i>News Service Africa.</i>
<i>Today a Red Cross representative</i>

1163
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,867

<i>from Lake Victoria.</i>

1167
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:06,177
Where is she?

1168
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:10,020
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

1169
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,491
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

1170
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,351
...she may not be coming.

1171
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,155
Thank you.

1172
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,464
Please, take these letters.

1173
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,800
Yes, I will take your letters.

1174
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,339
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

1175
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,708
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

1176
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:31,938
Thank you very much.

1177
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,777
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

1178
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,916
God be with you.

1179
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,484
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

1180
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,657
No, sorry, no good.

1181
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,527
Come. Come, children.

1182
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,326
Tatsi, come.

1183
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,533
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

1184
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,594
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

1185
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:58,661
There you go.

1186
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:00,638
Let's move out!

1187
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:05,676
Good luck, sir.

1188
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:21,687
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

1189
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,359
Paul. Paul!

1190
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:34,030
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

1191
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,370
Papa!

1192
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,412
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

1193
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,243
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1194
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,774
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

1195
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:45,876
Papa!

1196
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:49,719
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

1197
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,258
It's okay.

1198
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,117
<i>I say those Hutus</i>
<i>who shelter the cockroaches</i>

1199
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,520
<i>are the same as cockroaches.</i>

1200
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,524
- <i>They are all the same.</i>
- This is crazy.

1201
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:30,655
<i>Their fate should be the same.</i>
<i>This is RTLM.</i>

<i>The Tutsi cockroaches</i>

<i>Come on, good Hutus.</i>
<i>The graves are not yet full.</i>

1204
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:52,484
- <i>Who will help us fill them?</i>
- That goddamn radio station.

1205
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,853
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

1206
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:04,455
<i>Stand by your radios.</i>
<i>I am hearing some urgent news.</i>

1207
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,760
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

1208
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,805
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

1209
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,439
<i>We have received reports</i>
<i>of very important cockroaches</i>

1210

- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?

1214
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:31,821
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

1215
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:43,893
Please, sir,
I will give you whatever I have.

1216
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:46,531
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

1217
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:51,877
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush.

1218
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,460
Slow down.

1219
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:16,928
Stay calm.

1220
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:19,438
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

1221
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,839
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

1222
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,277
No, no. I've got
U.N. personnel in these trucks.

1223
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,577
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

1224
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,982
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

1225
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,748
- I am.
- Cover me.

1226
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,287
Go to the back.

1227
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:53,933
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

1228
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,645
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

1229
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,711
Get back! Move back!

1230
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,790
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

1231
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:15,522
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. sanction.

1232
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:23,297
<i>News has come to us</i>

No!

No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

1237
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:39,477
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

1238
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:41,378
Stop him!

1239
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,123
You bastard!

1240
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:51,956
What's your name?

1241
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,399
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

1242
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:58,171
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1243
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,072
What's your name?
What's your name?

1244
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:03,007
Let's move! Drive!

1245
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,840
Move! Get out!

1246
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,402
Out, or I'll shoot!

1247
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,639
Get out!

1248
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,014
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1249
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,949
Help us get out of here.

1250
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,789
Clear the street!

1251
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,100
<i>I am receiving more news,</i>
<i>good Hutus.</i>

1252
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:37,008
<i>I have learned that</i>
<i>the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches</i>

1253
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:38,477
<i>are on a truck.</i>

1254
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,776
<i>10.000 francs for their heads!</i>

1255
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,712
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

1256
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,287
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

1257
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,391
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

1258
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:04,234
Please, please.

1259
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:07,138
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

1260
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,937
Come, hurry, hurry.

1261
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,246
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

1262
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:18,708
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

1263
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,984
- I was so worried about you.
- Move that truck out of the way!

1264
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:25,047
Get him inside!

1265
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,021
Tatiana. Tatiana.

1266
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,854
You left me.
You left me.

1267
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:34,025
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1268
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:36,899
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

1269
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,267
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1270
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,139
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

1271
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:46,111
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

1272
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:57,519
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you.

1273
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:01,054
That was not
your decision to make.

1274
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:04,564
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

1275
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:06,327
You're right.

1276
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,434
You're right.

1277
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:11,403
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

1278
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:12,871
I'm sorry.

1279
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,401
Come on, put some more water.

1280
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:16,033
What are they doing?

1281
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:18,668
Dube.

1282
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:23,110
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

1283
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,318
General.

1284
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:32,859
Where are my supplies?

1285
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,594
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

1286
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:40,726
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1287
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:43,133
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1288
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,502
Sir, I have money from the guests.

1289
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,507
Rwandan francs!

1290
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:50,637
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

1291
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:54,340
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

1292
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:57,077
No more police,
no more protection.

1293
01:35:58,452 --> 01:36:01,319
Let the U.N. take care of you.

1294
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:05,987
Drive. Go!

1295
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,693
What would Sabena make of this?

1296
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:23,602
Watch out!

1297
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:31,107
Get down, get down!

1298
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:37,920
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

1299
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:40,517
Please stay still.
There's glass here. I will get it out.

1300
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:42,323
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

1301
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,523
Lots of cuts and bruises.

1302
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:52,870
Thank God it was a storeroom.

1303
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,744
<i>And in Rwanda,</i>
<i>humanitarian agencies report</i>

1304
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,337
<i>that a rapid advance</i>
<i>by the Tutsi rebel army</i>

1305
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:04,282
<i>has sparked a mass evacuation</i>
<i>of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.</i>

1306
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,512
<i>One aid worker described it</i>

1307
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:09,613
<i>as the largest refugee exodus</i>
<i>in modern history.</i>

1308
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,385
The rebels have taken half the city,

1309
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:15,656
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

1310
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:19,590
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

1311
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,498
and you people,
all of you,

1312
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,936
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

1313
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,064
The hterhamwe, what about them?

1314
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:30,474
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

1315
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:32,944
They will kill us all if we stay here.

1316
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:35,343
We have to take the chance.

1317
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:38,274
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1318
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,313
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

1319
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:42,650
Two days?

1320
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,220
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

1321
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,090
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

1322
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:53,691
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

1323
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:20,487
Diane...let your mother rest.

1324
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,893
You rest too, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.

1325
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:32,967
Diplomat.

1326
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:36,033
What?

1327
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:38,878
I have to go to the Diplomat.

1328
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:52,056
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

1329
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:54,651
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

1330
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,587
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1331
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,567
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

1332
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:15,174
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

1333
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,022
Move, move!

1334
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,804
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:41,863
Hurry!

1336
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:47,510
Come on, show me.

1337
01:39:56,724 --> 01:39:59,557
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

1338
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,658
And here you are.

1339
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,029
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

1340
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:14,430
The rebels can have this graveyard.

1341
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,840
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

1342
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,740
Here.

1343
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,077
Have a drink.

1344
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,848
You know what
the Scottish call it?

1345
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,415
No.

1346
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:38,663
<i>Uisge beatha</i>--water of life.

1347
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:50,811
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

1348
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:54,613
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

1349
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:57,239
Wonderful country.

1350
01:40:57,985 --> 01:40:59,577
Wonderful golf.

1351
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,915
I wonder, will I ever go back?

1352
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:06,821
What do you think?

1353
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:09,355
No.

1354
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:13,956
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

1355
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:17,027
Can we go now,
please, sir?

1356
01:41:18,772 --> 01:41:21,434
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

1357
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:23,476
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

1358
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:26,741
Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.

1359
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:32,042
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

1360
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,913
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

1361
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:37,650
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

1362
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:39,555
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

1363
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:45,030
Sir...General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

1364
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:48,227
Trust me,
we are better off here.

1365
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:53,171
General, these are difficult times.

1366
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,037
We need to help one another.

1367
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:58,442
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

1368
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:01,948
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

1369
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:05,815
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

1370
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:08,878
Paul, I am sick and tired
of your lies.

1371
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,720
Are you stupid, General?

1372
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,987
How do you think
these people operate?

1373
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:18,521
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

1374
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,297
Fine.

1375
01:42:25,706 --> 01:42:29,642
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

1376
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:33,612
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

1377
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,615
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

1378
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:39,914
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

1379
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:41,477
I led no massacres!

1380
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:43,489
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1381
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:45,081
You will tell them the truth!

1382
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:47,354
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

1383
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:51,630
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1384
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:54,998
Shoot me.

1385
01:42:55,636 --> 01:42:57,763
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

1386
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:01,171
I will pay you to shoot my family.

1387
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,507
You cannot hurt me.

1388
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:07,138
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

1389
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:12,750
We are leaving.
Right now.

1390
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:23,563
Get out!

1391
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,925
Get these people
away from the gate!

1392
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:35,833
Stop it! Stop it!

1393
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:37,841
Clear the hotel.

1394
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:40,773
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

1395
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,246
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

1396
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,312
Get out!

1397
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:49,315
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1398
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,071
Oh, no, no!

1399
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:13,635
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

1400
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,014
That's him. That's him!

1401
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:21,279
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

1402
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:24,620
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

1403
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:37,927
Stay where you are!

1404
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:56,548
Tatiana!

1405
01:44:57,858 --> 01:44:59,587
Tatiana!

1406
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:07,829
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

1407
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:10,392
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

1408
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:13,832
Tatiana!

1409
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:19,004
Tatiana!

1410
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:47,535
They've gone. They've gone.

1411
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:50,865
They've gone.

1412
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:57,773
What were you
going to do with this?

1413
01:46:07,494 --> 01:46:09,428
I thought you had...

1414
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:11,293
I thought you had jumped.

1415
01:46:23,477 --> 01:46:25,638
Everyone on the trucks, please.

1416
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:28,476
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

1417
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:31,415
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can, everyone. Please.

1418
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:33,919
There's enough room for everyone.

1419
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:39,089
I hope someday we will come back.

1420
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:41,521
Let's move out.

1421
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:53,664
What is wrong with her?

1422
01:46:54,341 --> 01:46:56,434
She has a very high fever.

1423
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:06,719
Where are we going, Daddy?

1424
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:08,414
Someplace safe.

1425
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:07,441
My God.

1426
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:31,428
What's happening?

1427
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:59,426
Come on, let's go. Children on the ground.
Bring the children this way.

1428
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:01,763
Pass them back, pass them back.

1429
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:11,004
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

1430
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,823
Get down!

1431
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:28,653
Stay down!

1432
01:49:52,185 --> 01:49:53,675
What's happening there?

1433
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,682
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

1434
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:04,425
It's okay. We're safe.

1435
01:50:04,497 --> 01:50:05,623
It's okay.

1436
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:07,690
It's okay, you are safe here.
You are safe.

1437
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:11,396
It's okay now.
Sit back down.

1438
01:50:13,173 --> 01:50:14,333
Hello.

1439
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:46,869
Get some more water.

1440
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:51,133
The doctor says he is
very dehydrated.

1441
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:53,736
We made it.
Come on, let's get down.

1442
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:56,912
- Come on.
- It is okay.

1443
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,712
- She is sick.
- Okay.

1444
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:01,153
Yeah, she's very sick.
Take her.

1445
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,924
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

1446
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:10,360
They'll take you to Tanzania.

1447
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:14,230
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

1448
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,631
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1449
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:17,932
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1450
01:51:20,907 --> 01:51:22,898
- Thank God.
- We made it.

1451
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:25,536
Please, please.
We are here, yeah?

1452
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:27,239
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

1453
01:51:27,313 --> 01:51:29,304
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

1454
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:30,772
Mr. Manager.

1455
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,250
- I just want to thank you.
- Of course, Steven.

1456
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:34,411
Constance!

1457
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:38,119
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

1458
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:40,682
Have you seen my brother
and his wife?

1459
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,920
None of them.

1460
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:45,187
Has anyone seen these people?
You don't recog--

1461
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:47,597
Mama, come see quick.

1462
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:50,135
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Can you see them anywhere?

1463
01:51:52,138 --> 01:51:53,730
Here, Mama, look.

1464
01:51:53,807 --> 01:51:55,069
Please.

1465
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:59,975
Do you see them, Mama?
Is that them?

1466
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,477
Is that them, Mama?

1467
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:05,910
Do you recognize these people?

1468
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:09,113
This little girl, she's Anais,
and this is Carine.

1469
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:10,679
Do you recognize them?

1470
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:16,122
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

1471
01:52:16,196 --> 01:52:18,357
Have any of you seen these girls?

1472
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,496
Anais. And that's my brother.

1473
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,561
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1474
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:36,339
Can you feel anything
when I touch here?

1475
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:38,441
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1476
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:41,112
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

1477
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:44,520
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- Okay.

1478
01:52:48,461 --> 01:52:50,088
Boussey?

1479
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:51,494
It's you.

1480
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:56,057
Where'd you find this child?

1481
01:52:56,136 --> 01:52:58,468
They just arrived
on trucks from the Mille Collines.

1482
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:04,609
<i>All Mille Collines evacuees</i>
<i>to the buses now, please.</i>

1483
01:53:04,677 --> 01:53:06,668
- Oh, no.
- We need to hurry up, please.

1484
01:53:13,052 --> 01:53:15,384
Come on, get some sleep.

1485
01:53:16,589 --> 01:53:17,715
Wait!

1486
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:29,198
Hold it, please!

1487
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,666
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

1488
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,208
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

1489
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:39,006
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

1490
01:53:39,078 --> 01:53:40,238
Come. Come, come.

1491
01:53:41,114 --> 01:53:42,809
Please, wait for us.

1492
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:45,715
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought...

1493
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,887
It's wonderful to see you.

1494
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:50,388
Come quickly.

1495
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,197
- Carine?
- Anais?

1496
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:01,494
Anais?

1497
01:54:01,568 --> 01:54:04,264
Just wait. It's gonna be
just a minute now.

1498
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:08,606
Anais? Carine?

1499
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:25,280
Oh, my God!

1500
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:28,618
Oh, my God!

1501
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,629
Come, come, come!

1502
01:54:34,167 --> 01:54:38,103
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

1503
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,101
Do you see your cousins?

1504
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:52,315
They said there wasn't any room.

1505
01:54:52,385 --> 01:54:54,046
There's always room.
