1
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,823
On your left.

2
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,159
On your right.

3
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,710
You must check in
with your P.O. Once a week.

4
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:26,379
Your P.O. Is entitled
to visit at any time.

5
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:30,258
You cannot come
within 300 feet of...

6
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:34,220
You must register immediately
upon return...

7
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,779
- Walter?
- Hey, Bob.

8
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,906
It's good to see you.

9
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,784
That's Mary-Kay.

10
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,375
The only reason I'm doing this is 'cause
I know you did good work for my father.

11
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,294
So you be here on time.
You do your work.

12
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,964
I don't want
any kind of problem, period.

13
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,149
God, that looks awful.

14
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,151
Yeah.

15
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,323
Now, this looks good.

16
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,953
Want some? Homemade.

17
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,206
No, thanks.

18
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,001
You won't taste
a better chicken salad in town.

19
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,462
I said no, thank you.

20
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,637
I'm sorry. I got to get back to work.

21
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:57,423
- So, how are you adjusting?
- I'm adjusting okay.

22
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,969
- And your new apartment?
- Apartment's okay.

23
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,930
- How's the job?
- The job's okay.

24
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,934
Do I take "okay" to mean
you feel good about working there?

25
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,187
I said the job's okay.

26
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,190
That's right. You did.

27
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,462
- Vicki!
- Fuck you, asshole.

28
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,632
- Come on. What's wrong, huh?
- Kiss my ass.

29
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,984
Boy, you still think fast.

30
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,570
You don't need to think fast
to handle a beer.

31
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,073
Well, it took some talking
to convince your super I was a relative.

32
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:07,660
Yeah, well, I told her
all my relatives were good-looking.

33
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,038
- Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,916
You look good...

35
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,585
damn good,
considering you're an old man now.

36
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,297
Feels like the whole world's
gotten younger.

37
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,884
So, you're doing okay?

38
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,427
Yeah, I'm okay.

39
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,305
- How's business?
- Booming.

40
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:31,351
Can't keep up with the work.
In fact, I just hired a few new guys.

41
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,979
Just until, you know, we catch up.

42
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,784
Living across the street
from a grade school. Jesus.

43
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,870
Something wrong with that?

44
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:54,833
I'm just thinking of the noise.

45
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,170
It's the only landlord in town
who'll take my money.

46
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,510
So, how's Annette?

47
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,179
A little tense.

48
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,807
You know, you're the only member
of the family still speaking to me.

49
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,017
Yeah, well, I remember when
they all gave Annette shit...

50
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:17,939
because she married the brown-skinned boy
from down the street... except her brother.

51
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,858
And what about Annette?

52
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:22,735
I'm workin' on it.

53
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:31,286
- So how old is Carla?
- She's gonna be 12 next week.

54
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,747
We're gonna throw her
a big party on Saturday.

55
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,877
I wish I could ask you to come.

56
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,118
Good enough
to eat today, baby.

57
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,871
Ooh, yeah.

58
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,831
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, huh?

59
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:20,251
How'd you like it if someone did
that shit to your sister, huh?

60
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,212
Piece of shit!

61
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:28,176
Fuck off!
Clean that shit up!

62
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,847
- Oh, yeah.
- Play with yourself, asshole!

63
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,655
You okay?

64
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,740
What?

65
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,577
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

66
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,140
So, what'd he do?

67
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:21,855
- What did who do?
- You know, the new guy.

68
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:27,527
Drugs, armed robbery,
manslaughter...

69
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,946
Mind your business, Mary-Kay.

70
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,160
Have you made any friends there?

71
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,288
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

72
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,790
You seem a little hostile today.

73
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,793
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.

74
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,130
No need to call me doctor.
I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.

75
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,007
It's all the same to me.

76
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:53,761
Walter, I'd like you
to try something for me.

77
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,556
- What's that?
- I'd like you to keep a journal.

78
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:59,142
- No fuckin' way.
- Why not?

79
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,769
Evidence.

80
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,023
Perhaps a journal would
encourage you to reflect.

81
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,110
Try it?

82
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:42,602
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20.

83
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,689
320 feet.

84
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,821
How about that?

85
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,260
Want a ride?

86
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,514
- I'm all right.
- It's fucking freezing out here.

87
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,474
- I'm fine.
- Come on. I won't bite.

88
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:32,045
Something wrong
with this picture.

89
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,214
Here's this nice, hard-working guy...

90
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,716
suddenly appears out of the blue.

91
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,843
Takes the bus to and from work.

92
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,845
I mean, who takes
the bus anymore?

93
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,390
People who don't have cars.

94
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,978
- It's very weird.
- Not as weird as a sharp, young...

95
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,022
good-looking woman
working in a lumberyard.

96
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,024
Oh, yeah?
What's weird about that?

97
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,817
Most women wouldn't choose it.

98
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,738
Guess I'm not like most women.

99
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,253
You never spoke to me before.

100
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,840
I thought you were a dyke.

101
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:27,100
- Are you?
- What do you think?

102
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,079
You plan on drinking
both those beers?

103
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,375
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:57,213
- Is that a school?
- K through sixth.

105
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,215
Doesn't it get noisy?

106
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,177
I like the noise.

107
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,859
I used to think you were shy...

108
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,569
but now I think it's something else.

109
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:24,157
What?

110
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:28,536
- Something happened to you.
- Yeah?

111
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,538
I'm not easily shocked.

112
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,042
I get that impression.

113
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:41,299
So, you gonna tell me your dark secret?

114
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,759
Why do you want to know?

115
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,844
Don't you think I should know
before we have sex?

116
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,307
I don't like to waste time.

117
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,734
So, you gonna tell me
your deep, dark secret?

118
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,032
No.

119
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,702
Okay.

120
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,320
So, you're not a dyke.

121
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,364
Not tonight.

122
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:34,287
Hey, that was intense.

123
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,541
You're still here.

124
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,543
I didn't say I didn't like it.

125
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,123
What are you doing?

126
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,334
This table's a heavy little bitch, man.

127
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,133
It's cherry.

128
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,929
This wood. It's cherry.

129
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,889
It's a nice table.

130
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:37,642
It's my own design. You're not gonna
find another one like it in the world.

131
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,603
- It was a beautiful gift.
- So, why are you giving it back to me?

132
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,856
Because, man, you need a table.

133
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:47,110
Carlos, I made this table for you
and Annette as a wedding present.

134
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,279
- I put a lot into it.
- I know, man.

135
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,950
I love the table too.
But I also love my wife.

136
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,869
Hey, you got a beer?

137
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,480
"I watch the kids arrive at school.

138
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,821
But for the last few weeks,
I've noticed someone else watching them.

139
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,419
I call him Candy. "

140
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,933
She's at the top
of her class at school.

141
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,852
How about your kids?

142
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,395
- They're good.
- Yeah?

143
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,980
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

144
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,066
She's really doing great at school.

145
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,026
I don't see her much, but...

146
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,453
- I'd keep away from him.
- What?

147
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,581
The new guy.

148
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,083
I'd keep away from him
if I were you.

149
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,712
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- I think he's damaged goods...

150
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,881
real damaged.

151
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:16,217
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do.

152
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,138
Thanks a bunch for the advice.

153
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,059
Suit yourself.

154
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:43,077
Close, but no ciggy.

155
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,754
Thanks, babe.

156
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:57,884
Thank you.

157
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,811
Hey, Walter.

158
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:11,189
Hello.

159
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,399
Hello.

160
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,307
You okay?

161
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:34,814
Walter, what did you do?

162
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,528
What happened to you?

163
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:44,824
Walter?

164
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:51,706
Why do you want to know?

165
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,211
Because I like you.

166
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,597
What's the worst thing
you ever did?

167
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,934
The worst?

168
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,480
I fucked my best friend's husband.

169
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,611
I mean, my best friend
since second grade.

170
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:28,243
He had the hots for me and...
Yeah, he was cute.

171
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,704
We'd get it on for days.

172
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,374
And then he told her... the shit.

173
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:37,919
Broke up their marriage.
Ruined our friendship.

174
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,298
I still feel like the lowest piece of shit
when I think about that.

175
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:48,012
So, what did you do?

176
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,268
I molested little girls.

177
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,700
Twelve years in prison is no joke.

178
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,267
How young?

179
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,811
Between 10 and 12.

180
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,856
Once a nine-year-old
told me she was 11.

181
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:42,358
Once a 14-year-old
told me she was 12.

182
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,695
I always asked
how old they were.

183
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,328
What did you do to them?

184
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,581
It's not what you think.

185
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,878
I never hurt them.

186
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:05,131
Never.

187
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,430
Look...

188
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,517
I want you to go now, all right?

189
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,982
I told you
I'm not easily shocked.

190
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,943
Yeah, well, you should be shocked.

191
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,779
- Or do you get off on this shit?
- What?

192
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:37,640
When will I be normal?

193
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,851
We have a lot of work to do.

194
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:43,062
- Will I ever be normal?
- What's your idea of being normal?

195
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,899
What's your idea
of being a fuckin' shrink?

196
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,210
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

197
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,253
Sorry.

198
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,442
So what's happening?

199
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:31,903
Braves are kicking the shit
out of the Phillies.

200
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,738
Fucking Phillies.

201
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,910
It's just the beginning of the season.
You got to give them a chance.

202
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,296
- So, how was the party?
- What party?

203
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:53,007
- The birthday party.
- Fuck. It was great.

204
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,343
You should have seen Carla.
She was so pretty.

205
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,971
She looked like a princess.

206
00:27:58,012 --> 00:27:59,889
She's the light of my life, man.

207
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,101
You don't want
to love them too much though.

208
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:06,187
No such thing, man.
I couldn't love her enough.

209
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,733
Oh, I've got photos.
You want to see?

210
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,735
- Nah, it's all right.
- Ah, come on.

211
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:15,572
I don't want to see
any goddamn pictures, all right?

212
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:20,118
They're just photos
I took at the party.

213
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:24,789
Carlos, I want to see my sister
and my niece in person.

214
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,249
Okay?

215
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,127
Yeah, okay.

216
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,176
I'm just saying Carlos
has a thing for his daughter.

217
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:38,178
If he's not careful, he's gonna suffer.

218
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,476
You think I'm crazy?

219
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,228
Do you think you're crazy?

220
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:52,317
You know, talking to you is like riding
on a fuckin' merry-go-round.

221
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,527
That's a marvellous image, Walter.

222
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:59,199
Because by going in circles we find things
we missed the first time around.

223
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:05,955
When will I be normal?

224
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:56,840
"So what should I do?

225
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,800
Call the cops?

226
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:01,427
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

227
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:05,431
But what if Candy seduces one
to go for a ride?

228
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,352
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:12,981
If the boy goes for a ride...

230
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:15,358
it's because he wants
to go for a ride. "

231
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,011
Walter.

232
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:45,096
Cop.

233
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,349
Sergeant Lucas.
You mind if I come in?

234
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,893
You are in.

235
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,606
Yeah, I am.
But I always like to ask.

236
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:57,483
It's a force of habit.
You don't mind if I look around, do you?

237
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,985
I would.

238
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:04,449
Why, you got something to hide?

239
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:06,034
Doesn't everybody?

240
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:11,498
Have a seat.

241
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:20,423
I could get a search warrant.

242
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:24,344
Yeah, if you could get a search warrant,
you would have brought one today.

243
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:32,477
This cherry?

244
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:35,813
Yeah.

245
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,986
It's a little unusual design
for a contemporary piece, but...

246
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:54,541
Walter...

247
00:31:56,125 --> 00:32:00,797
two nights ago a 10-year-old girl
got attacked not far from here.

248
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,300
That's a bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

249
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,220
- What time did it happen?
- I'll ask the questions.

250
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,722
If you tell me what time
it happened, maybe I could...

251
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:11,933
Get your hands out
of your fuckin' pockets!

252
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,022
Sit down!

253
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:37,750
I know every fuckin' move
you make...

254
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,379
every goddamn step.

255
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:43,423
When you sleep, when you eat...

256
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:46,509
when you shit, when you jack off...

257
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:48,511
When you're sitting there
by the window...

258
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:51,598
watching the little girls
in their cotton white dresses...

259
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:54,642
and you're sittin' there on your little
jack-off bench, and you're jackin' off.

260
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:56,603
Do you show your cock
to little girls when you jack off?

261
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:58,980
- You can't talk to me like...
- Like what?

262
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:02,609
Like a piece of shit? That's what
you are to me, a piece of shit.

263
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,569
Throw you out
that window right now.

264
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:06,571
Think somebody's gonna miss you?

265
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:10,408
I could say you jumped
when I came in.

266
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:14,120
Who you think
they're gonna believe, me or you?

267
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,706
You'd just be a dead piece of shit.

268
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,217
We need to make sure...

269
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:29,385
that you're being
a good boy, Walter.

270
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,471
Okay?

271
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,848
- Okay?
- Okay.

272
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,433
Okay.

273
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:39,395
Okay.

274
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:42,774
Have a good day.

275
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,528
Nice table.

276
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,446
Yes, may I help you, please?

277
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:17,095
- What did you think would happen?
- I don't know.

278
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:19,264
- What did you want to happen?
- I don't know!

279
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:23,893
Would you please stop writing
in the fucking pad?

280
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:29,023
You know that if anything happens to me,
I go back to prison.

281
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:31,359
No parole. No nothin'. For life.

282
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:33,194
- Is this the first one?
- Of course it is!

283
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,905
- Why do you think I'm telling you?
- I want you to calm down.

284
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,535
You followed a girl.

285
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:44,914
Perhaps you wanted to see
what it felt like after so many years.

286
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,460
Maybe subconsciously
you were testing yourself.

287
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:53,756
And here you are...

288
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:56,843
talking about it with me.

289
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,220
This is positive.

290
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:06,728
Walter, we'll pick up here
next week.

291
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:19,032
Remember when
you asked me what...

292
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,326
my idea of normal was?

293
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:24,954
Normal is when I can see a girl...

294
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:27,207
be near a girl, even talk to a girl...

295
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,211
and not think about...

296
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:37,550
That's my idea of normal.

297
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,442
What are you lookin' at?

298
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:46,095
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

299
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:48,348
A plant. I don't need a plant.

300
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:50,308
Everyone needs a plant.

301
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:54,395
This ivy is one tough baby.

302
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,773
It's a cutting from one of mine.

303
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,399
So, here's the deal.

304
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:00,443
Give it a little water...

305
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:02,695
go easy on the direct sunlight...

306
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:05,824
and notice it
every once in a while.

307
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:08,159
They love it when you look at 'em
or touch their leaves.

308
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:11,704
Think you can handle that?

309
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,880
Such an asshole.

310
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,426
Thanks.

311
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,723
Want to go for a ride?

312
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,685
Sure.

313
00:40:33,726 --> 00:40:36,187
Get your coat.

314
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,121
Why do you stay?

315
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:21,876
I see something in you,
something good.

316
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,338
You don't see it yet, but I do.

317
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:28,716
You know, most people
say the odds are against me.

318
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:31,511
What odds?

319
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,806
Percentages...

320
00:42:34,806 --> 00:42:36,808
for guys like me.

321
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:41,563
Most of us end up back there.

322
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,860
Well, most people don't know
what they're talking about.

323
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:52,073
You want to talk about odds?

324
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:54,075
Someday I'll tell you how I survived...

325
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:56,452
as the only daughter
in a family with three sons.

326
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:01,332
Hell, maybe you should
tell me now.

327
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,293
Maybe not.

328
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:05,295
You scared?

329
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:13,052
I got poked around
here and there.

330
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,264
Jesus. Which brother?

331
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:21,102
All three, in chronological order.

332
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,732
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:32,113
I'm trying to tell you who I am,
if you're interested.

334
00:43:34,908 --> 00:43:37,076
You must hate your brothers.

335
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,078
- I love my brothers.
- No, you don't.

336
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:44,918
I love all of them.

337
00:43:47,045 --> 00:43:50,173
They're strong, gentle men
with families of their own.

338
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:56,471
If you ever asked them about what they did
to me, they'd beat the shit out of you.

339
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:58,806
And they'd call you a fucking liar.

340
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:06,606
Hey...

341
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:08,817
I never told anyone that before.

342
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:52,735
Yeah, he's right there.

343
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:06,457
Hey, Jim.

344
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:28,605
Yeah. Okay.

345
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,316
I'll tell him. Bye-bye.

346
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:32,901
Bob said you wanted to see me.

347
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:36,654
He wants everyone to sign
this card for Reggie.

348
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,410
It's a baby girl.

349
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:44,537
Reggie must be a happy man.

350
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,667
I heard you're lookin'
for another job.

351
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,711
Where'd you hear that?

352
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:55,298
- Around.
- I'm not lookin' for another job.

353
00:45:55,298 --> 00:46:00,094
I just heard they're looking for some
good men down at Dan Shroeder's place.

354
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:05,266
I like my job. Thank you.

355
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:07,287
- So, I've got some good news.
- What's that?

356
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:09,330
Annette will see you.

357
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:12,792
Aren't you glad?

358
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:16,004
When?

359
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:18,381
Early July.

360
00:47:21,634 --> 00:47:25,096
- That's three months from now.
- It's a better time.

361
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:27,891
Carla will be away at camp.
House'll be quiet.

362
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:29,726
It's better when it's quiet.

363
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:33,021
- Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
- Now, come on, Walter.

364
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:35,607
You should see my appointment book.
It just got crazy.

365
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:38,485
- It isn't what you think.
- Isn't it?

366
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:42,697
Look, the important thing
is that you and Annette talk.

367
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:46,284
She needs to see you,
and you need to see her.

368
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:50,955
I'm not a monster.

369
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:54,209
Hey.

370
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,046
So next week, Annette's gonna
be away for a few days, right?

371
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:00,924
And the thing is,
when Annette's away...

372
00:48:00,924 --> 00:48:02,967
I get horny as hell for other women.

373
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,803
I mean, I fantasize about
fucking some beautiful woman.

374
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,931
You don't have to tell me this.

375
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,517
I know. I'm just sayin' I understand.

376
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:17,941
It's crazy out there. I mean,
girls wearing mini-this, mini-that...

377
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:21,194
Sometimes when I walk down the street
and I pass a sexy-looking woman...

378
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:23,196
she makes me feel
like I'm bothering her.

379
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:26,074
Hey, I see a pretty lady, I look.

380
00:48:26,115 --> 00:48:28,618
That's the price of beauty, my friend.

381
00:48:28,618 --> 00:48:32,330
You wouldn't believe the things Carla
and her friends are wearin' these days.

382
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:41,214
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

383
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,011
You ever have...

384
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,806
feelings for Carla?

385
00:48:50,807 --> 00:48:52,433
What do you mean?

386
00:48:52,475 --> 00:48:56,437
You know, feelings.

387
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,987
Look, man, I ain't got your sick fuckin'...
Disease? Is that what it is?

388
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,531
Whatever the fuck it is,
I ain't got it.

389
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:09,909
So if you ever touch
my daughter, I'll kill you.

390
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,271
When I say the word "girl"...

391
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:42,275
what is the earliest image
you can remember?

392
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:45,653
When I say the word "pretty,"
when I say the word "pleasure"...

393
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:49,991
who do you see?

394
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:58,291
I see my sister.

395
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,003
Where is she?

396
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:07,550
She's asleep in my bedroom.

397
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,094
Where are you?

398
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,722
I'm in my bed too.

399
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:20,021
How old are you and your sister?

400
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:25,360
Oh, about six.

401
00:50:26,277 --> 00:50:28,947
That would make her four.

402
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:34,202
What are you doing?

403
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:37,997
Nothin'. Takin' a nap.

404
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:41,209
- A nap?
- Yeah, a nap.

405
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:43,837
Kids take naps.
You ever take a nap, Rosen?

406
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:47,632
I don't wanna talk about this.
What the hell are you doin' back there?

407
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,884
Did you and your sister
often take naps...

408
00:50:49,926 --> 00:50:52,303
I want you back in your chair. Now!

409
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:56,558
I'm sorry.

410
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:59,018
I don't like nobody behind my back.

411
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:06,276
Walter, what did you do
while taking naps with your sister?

412
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,071
Nothin'.

413
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:14,242
Did you touch her?
Did you take her clothes off?

414
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:16,411
- You take your clothes off?
- This is bullshit.

415
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:18,621
I'm only asking questions.

416
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,713
All right. I'm gonna tell you
just to shut you up.

417
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:32,427
I smelled her hair.

418
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:36,431
What else?

419
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:38,474
Nothin'.

420
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:40,018
That's it.

421
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:44,147
I just liked smellin' her hair.

422
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,525
You felt pleasure?

423
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,031
Yes.

424
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:57,827
- Did you get an erection?
- I was six years old.

425
00:51:57,827 --> 00:52:01,414
I meant later,
when you two took naps...

426
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,543
when the two of you
held each other...

427
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:09,339
when you were 10 or 11,
and she was eight or nine...

428
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:14,844
when the two of you
were all alone...

429
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:17,889
completely alone in that big house.

430
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:23,436
It was a small house.

431
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:28,358
All right. A small house...

432
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:30,735
with small rooms.

433
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,705
I smelled her hair.

434
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:45,708
That's all.

435
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:52,173
I just liked smellin' her hair.

436
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:24,052
Hi.

437
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:26,971
Hello.

438
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:29,390
What are you looking at?

439
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:33,061
Up in that oak tree
there's a nest.

440
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:35,522
- Where?
- Up there.

441
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:39,818
- A little higher.
- There are little chicks.

442
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:42,904
- You want to see?
- Sure.

443
00:56:47,116 --> 00:56:49,702
They're starlings.

444
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:52,789
- Is that right?
- I don't like starlings.

445
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:56,501
- Why not?
- They're extremely aggressive birds.

446
00:56:56,459 --> 00:56:58,795
Plus their habits are pretty filthy.

447
00:56:59,629 --> 00:57:02,215
The mother must have her hands full.

448
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:04,801
So, you always carry these with you?

449
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,845
When I go bird-watching.

450
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:08,888
It's why I like coming here.

451
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,890
It's just a city park.

452
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:14,018
You'd be surprised
how many kinds of birds you find here.

453
00:57:13,977 --> 00:57:16,229
Last week, I saw a purple martin...

454
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:19,023
and the week before that,
I saw a solitary vireo.

455
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:22,652
- That's rare.
- A solitary vireo?

456
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:26,281
- I like that.
- Their sound is really musical.

457
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:30,994
Are you a bird-watcher too?

458
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:33,872
Me? No, I'm a...

459
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,915
more of a people-watcher.

460
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,460
The way you were staring
at the tops of those trees...

461
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:41,462
I thought you were
gonna take off and fly.

462
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,257
I should go now.

463
00:57:44,299 --> 00:57:45,758
You come here a lot?

464
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,719
My daddy likes me home
before dark.

465
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:52,223
- Well, it's good to listen to your dad.
- Bye.

466
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,537
Good morning, fellow sports fans.
The match is about to begin.

467
00:58:14,496 --> 00:58:16,998
Candy enters the arena
looking sweet and trim.

468
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:21,503
He checks out the scene but plays it cool.
He's definitely holding back.

469
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:24,214
Uh-oh. Candy's eyes
have locked on to something.

470
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:27,926
Oh, yeah. A cherub lad has separated
himself from his friends.

471
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:32,555
Candy quickly makes his move.
He offers the boy a bag of treats.

472
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:34,015
Round one to Candy.

473
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:36,893
The cherub walks away.!

474
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:38,561
Round two goes to the cherub.

475
00:58:38,603 --> 00:58:40,730
Very risky move by Candy.

476
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:45,068
I have never seen Candy act so cocky.

477
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:47,445
The cherub looks at Candy.
Cherub looks for his friends.

478
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:50,532
But his friends are long gone.
The cherub is alone.

479
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:52,534
The cherub crosses the street...

480
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:03,503
The cherub gets in the car.

481
00:59:50,884 --> 00:59:55,346
- Hey, Walter.
- What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?

482
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:57,932
You can listen to
my stories about Jesus.

483
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,942
Oh, no. This is too much.
This is too much sun.

484
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,361
- What?
- This is ivy.

485
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:12,447
These plants don't like
a lot of sunlight.

486
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,491
Don't they grow outside?

487
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:19,120
Yeah, they grow outside.
But outside they got trees to shade 'em.

488
01:00:19,037 --> 01:00:21,456
So now you're gonna take me
on a nature walk?

489
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,376
Have a seat.

490
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:32,675
So, yesterday you take
the 12 bus home...

491
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:35,428
but you don't get off
at your regular stop.

492
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:37,472
You stay on.
Why'd you stay on?

493
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:40,642
Fell asleep. When I woke up,
I was confused.

494
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:43,561
I got off at the wrong stop,
and I walked home.

495
01:00:45,063 --> 01:00:46,856
You walked home?

496
01:00:48,274 --> 01:00:49,818
Yeah.

497
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,453
Some of these guys...

498
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:03,039
they walk right
into a family's house.

499
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,124
Very...

500
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:08,211
It's very fuckin' ballsy.

501
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:10,880
Had this one guy,
he's on death row...

502
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,424
I'll call him Henry...

503
01:01:13,466 --> 01:01:15,593
and he's tellin' me
about his last victim.

504
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,056
She's a little...
little cutie named Adele.

505
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:23,017
She's seven years old.

506
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:28,273
And Adele's mother's got
the TV playing so loud...

507
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:33,945
he can hear Letterman
tellin' jokes in the next room.

508
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,906
And he walks into Adele's room...

509
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:38,950
puts his hand over her mouth.

510
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:43,079
He says, "If you scream, little girl,
I'm gonna kill your mother. "

511
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:46,040
So, of course,
Adele doesn't scream.

512
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:50,044
She doesn't cry.
She doesn't make a sound.

513
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:53,715
And Henry takes her by the hand.

514
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:57,927
They walk out the front door.

515
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:05,210
Ten days later,
they find Adele's body...

516
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:06,728
what's left of it.

517
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:11,065
You believe in fairy tales?

518
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:16,279
Fairy tales?

519
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:21,659
Yeah, like, Alice in Wonderland and...

520
01:02:23,411 --> 01:02:24,913
No.

521
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:28,625
Yeah. Yeah, me neither.

522
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:35,215
What's the one with the woodsman?

523
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:39,469
- Woodsman?
- Yeah. With the ax.

524
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:42,388
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know it.

525
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,391
The woodsman...
He cuts open a wolf's stomach.

526
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,353
The little girl comes out alive.

527
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:50,563
- Little Red Riding Hood.
- Little Red Riding Hood.

528
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:52,899
That's it. That's it.

529
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:57,028
The woodsman...
He cuts open the wolf's stomach.

530
01:02:56,986 --> 01:03:00,782
The girl comes out without a scratch.

531
01:03:11,584 --> 01:03:14,671
You ever see a seven-year-old...

532
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:17,382
been sodomized in half?

533
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:24,639
She was so small...

534
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:28,143
just broken.

535
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:34,774
I saw 20-year vets on that job...
hard guys, man...

536
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:37,443
and they just broke down and cried.

537
01:03:37,443 --> 01:03:40,530
I was there. I cried.

538
01:03:53,668 --> 01:03:56,754
There ain't no fuckin' woodsman
in this world.

539
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:10,852
I don't know why they keep
lettin' freaks like you out on the street.

540
01:04:10,768 --> 01:04:14,397
It just means that we gotta
catch you all over again.

541
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,545
I'll see you, Walter.

542
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:00,902
Talk to me like you fuckin'...

543
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:02,862
Speak to me like you fuckin'...

544
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,281
I am not...

545
01:05:06,324 --> 01:05:08,368
I am not...

546
01:06:03,173 --> 01:06:06,050
- Let's go.
- You don't feel sorry for this sick fuck.

547
01:06:06,009 --> 01:06:08,678
- Mind your own business, Pedro.
- This is my business.

548
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:17,645
What the hell is goin' on here?

549
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:23,860
Who did this?

550
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:28,198
Any man who can't deal with it,
you meet me in the office.

551
01:06:28,198 --> 01:06:30,867
I'll pay you for the week.
You can clear the fuck out.

552
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:33,995
We got a lot of orders today.
Get to work.

553
01:06:33,953 --> 01:06:35,830
This is bullshit.

554
01:06:45,757 --> 01:06:47,967
Are you okay?

555
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:54,849
Watch your back, bitch.

556
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,809
This is ready whenever.

557
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:51,406
Where's Walter?

558
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:53,032
I don't know.

559
01:07:57,078 --> 01:07:58,746
I don't fucking believe this.

560
01:07:58,788 --> 01:08:02,000
- Goddamn it, Mary-Kay!
- Bitch, what the fuck are you doin'?

561
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,962
- What is going on?
- This is bullshit, Bob!

562
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,422
It's bullshit.

563
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,675
People have the right to know.

564
01:09:57,407 --> 01:09:59,659
See anything interesting?

565
01:10:00,451 --> 01:10:01,995
Not yet.

566
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:19,053
- What are you writin' in that book?
- It's my bird book.

567
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:22,599
I've identified 67 species
of birds this year alone.

568
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:24,642
Wow.

569
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:29,981
Where are your friends?

570
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:34,486
Don't you have any friends?

571
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:38,907
I have friends.

572
01:10:41,034 --> 01:10:43,161
A pretty girl like you
should have a lot of friends.

573
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:44,746
I'm not pretty.

574
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:47,916
- Well, not in the common way.
- What does that mean?

575
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,920
It means that uncommon beauty...

576
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,880
is commonly overlooked.

577
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:58,176
You know, like people only notice...

578
01:10:58,134 --> 01:11:00,887
the birds with the brightest colors.

579
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:10,855
What's your name?

580
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:20,323
Let's see. Linda.

581
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,618
Susan?

582
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,328
Jennifer?

583
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,413
Jackie?

584
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:32,585
You tell me your name,
and I'll tell ya mine.

585
01:11:33,586 --> 01:11:35,547
Robin.

586
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:37,799
Yeah, like the bird.

587
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,094
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

588
01:11:41,094 --> 01:11:43,471
- No, you're not.
- I will be in three months.

589
01:11:43,513 --> 01:11:45,640
I can't wait. I hate being 11.

590
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:48,601
It has to be the stupidest age
in the world.

591
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:56,025
What's your name?

592
01:11:57,277 --> 01:11:58,945
Walter.

593
01:11:58,987 --> 01:12:02,157
- Do you have many friends?
- No.

594
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:04,200
How come?

595
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,954
A long time ago, I was sent away f...

596
01:12:09,622 --> 01:12:11,583
When I came home,
all my friends were gone.

597
01:12:11,624 --> 01:12:13,835
Sounds like you were banished.

598
01:12:16,045 --> 01:12:18,256
Banished, yeah.

599
01:12:18,256 --> 01:12:21,092
Birds are my friends.
They know I watch them...

600
01:12:21,134 --> 01:12:23,720
but they don't mind
because they like being watched...

601
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,306
if they know
you won't hurt them.

602
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:35,565
- Robin...
- Yes?

603
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:39,402
Would you like to sit on my lap?

604
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:41,779
What?

605
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:45,241
Would you like to sit on my lap?

606
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,327
No, thank you.

607
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:50,955
Okay.

608
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:53,041
Doesn't matter.

609
01:12:59,214 --> 01:13:01,257
Do you want me to sit on your lap?

610
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:08,014
Yes.

611
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:10,225
I would enjoy that.

612
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:22,946
I know this place that's really quiet...

613
01:13:22,946 --> 01:13:26,032
except for the sound
of these tiny little birds.

614
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:29,953
They sound like finches.

615
01:13:29,953 --> 01:13:32,330
Yeah, they might be finches.

616
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:36,918
Do you want to see?

617
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:45,802
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

618
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:49,681
- Does he?
- Yes.

619
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:51,891
Do you like it when he asks you?

620
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:56,146
No.

621
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:09,200
Why not?

622
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:20,753
Are you two alone
when he asks you?

623
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:29,262
Does he say strange things?

624
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:37,145
Does he move his legs
in funny ways?

625
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:09,594
Walter...

626
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:14,641
do you still want me
to sit on your lap?

627
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:18,228
I will.

628
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:19,813
I don't mind.

629
01:15:22,065 --> 01:15:23,608
No.

630
01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:33,326
Go home, Robin.

631
01:18:54,068 --> 01:18:55,570
Come on in. It's open.

632
01:18:57,322 --> 01:18:59,157
Hey, Walter.

633
01:19:01,451 --> 01:19:03,578
What can I do for you,
Sergeant Lucas?

634
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:06,289
I don't know. We'll see.

635
01:19:06,289 --> 01:19:11,294
You didn't hear? Last night...

636
01:19:11,169 --> 01:19:14,589
all that shoutin'
and screamin' outside?

637
01:19:16,132 --> 01:19:17,675
No.

638
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:21,137
Yeah, a guy got beat up
pretty bad last night out there.

639
01:19:21,137 --> 01:19:23,097
- You don't know anything about this?
- Nope.

640
01:19:23,139 --> 01:19:24,682
I could take ya downtown.

641
01:19:26,518 --> 01:19:28,061
Yeah, you could...

642
01:19:29,312 --> 01:19:31,523
but it'd be a waste of your time.

643
01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:36,694
There was a boy there.
He could I.D. The assailant.

644
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:38,863
He gave a description.

645
01:19:38,905 --> 01:19:41,491
It fits you really, really close.

646
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:47,997
That's a nasty scratch
on your neck.

647
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:52,210
I got a passionate girlfriend.

648
01:19:57,674 --> 01:19:59,759
What's with the boxes?

649
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:01,469
I'm movin' in with her.

650
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:07,517
Congrats. Lucky you.

651
01:20:08,393 --> 01:20:10,478
I count my blessings.

652
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,730
Yeah, I bet you do.

653
01:20:16,568 --> 01:20:18,736
Well, all right.

654
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:22,824
I'll be seein' you around, Walter.

655
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:28,955
Hey.

656
01:20:31,124 --> 01:20:33,459
You think you're gonna
catch this guy?

657
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,045
Yeah. Yeah.

658
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:37,839
We're gonna catch him.

659
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:42,010
But the victim can't talk.

660
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,055
Among all his other injuries,
he's got a broken jaw.

661
01:20:46,055 --> 01:20:48,433
However, we did run
a check on the victim...

662
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:50,852
and as it turns out
he's wanted in Virginia.

663
01:20:51,895 --> 01:20:54,063
Raped a boy down there.

664
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:09,704
You stay out of trouble, Walter.
I'm watchin' you.

665
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:40,086
I saw my sister.

666
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:43,131
It was hard.

667
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,802
She's still really hurt and angry.

668
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,391
I understand that. I do.

669
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:05,945
It's gonna take time, Walter.

670
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,073
Time?

671
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:14,287
How do you feel about that?

672
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:17,957
I feel...

673
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:21,669
okay.
