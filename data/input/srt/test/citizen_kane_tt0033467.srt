NARRATOR:
Legendary was the Xanadu...

4
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,468
...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,096
Today, almost as legendary,
is Florida's Xanadu...

6
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,225
...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.

7
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,688
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...

8
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,899
...was commissioned
and successfully built.

9
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,236
One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...

10
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,988
...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.

11
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,408
Contents of Xanadu's palace:

12
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,704
Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.

13
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,915
A collection of everything.

14
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,252
So big it can never
be cataloged or appraised.

15
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,256
Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.

16
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,803
Xanadu's livestock...

17
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:29,351
...the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea,
the beast of the field and jungle...

18
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,939
...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.

19
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,692
Like the pharaohs...

20
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,821
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.

21
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,865
Since the pyramids...

22
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,743
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

23
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,329
...a man has built to himself.

24
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,012
Here in Xanadu last week...

25
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,265
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.

30
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,974
Kane's empire, in its glory...

31
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,270
...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...

32
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,025
...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.

33
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,945
The first of grocery stores, paper mills...

34
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:09,701
...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.

35

An empire through which for 50 years...

36
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,707
...flowed in an unending stream...

37

...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.

Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.

39

How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...

40
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,308
...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:

41
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,520
The Colorado Lode.

42
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,774
Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...

43

...Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...

...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47

...for a large fortune
she recently acquired.

48

MAN [OVER SPEAKERS]:
The words "Charles Foster Kane"...

61
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,045
...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.

...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.

No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.

73

Often support, then denounce.

...singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton,
New Jersey.

For wife two, one-time opera-singing

00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,297
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

307
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,883
- ...and you ought to get...
- You won't be lonely.

308
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,428
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

309
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,431
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am l?

310
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,017
- What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.

311
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,894
- Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie!

312
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,438
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

313
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,606
KANE:
Mom!

314
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,317
MARY:
You got to go. Jim!

315
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,945
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

316
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,906
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.

317
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:51,327
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

318
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,391
THATCHER:
Well, Charles...

319
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,229
- ...Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

320
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,564
And a happy New Year.

321
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,941
In closing...

322
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,820
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

323
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,656
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

324
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,284
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

325
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,787
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

326
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,998
- Got that?
- "The world's sixth largest private fortune."

327
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,002
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

328
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,505
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

329
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,258
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

330
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,552
MAN 1: "Dear Mr. Thatcher."
MAN 2: It's from Mr. Kane.

331
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,138
- Go on.
- "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

332
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,223
...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

333
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,517
Not interested?

334
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,020
"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.

335
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,023
A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

336
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,484
Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

337
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,028
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

338
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:12,241
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.

339
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,576
[GROANS]

340
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,209
"Traction Trust exposed."

341
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,920
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."

342
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,340
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."

343
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,927
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

344
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:36,599
"Inquirer wins slum fight." Oh....

345
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,187
MAN:
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

346
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,397
"Copper robbers indicted."

347
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,400
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

348
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,069
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

349
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,573
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

350
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,576
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

351
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,579
- ...armada's off the Jersey Coast.
- Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

352
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,122
Can you prove it isn't?

353
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,000
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

354
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,877
- Mr. Leland.
- Hello.

355
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,629
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

356
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:11,926
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

357
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,846
He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

358
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,974
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...

359
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,853
...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

360
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,773
There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

361
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,402
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

362
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,197
- That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.

363
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,616
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

364
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,577
The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

365
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,871
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

366
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,540
Still the college boy, eh?

367
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,710
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

368
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,214
Charles, I think I should remind you
of a fact you have forgotten.

369
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,134
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

370
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,304
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

371
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,516
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

372
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,395
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

373
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,022
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

374
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,359
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

375
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,238
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1000.

376
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,157
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

377
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,412
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

378
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,708
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

379
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,419
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

380
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,006
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

381
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,342
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

382
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,305
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

383
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,350
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

384
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,519
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

385
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,895
That would be too bad.

386
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,106
I saw your financial statement today.

387
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,192
- Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...

388
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,614
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

389
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,742
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

390
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,663
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

391
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,416
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

392
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,044
At the rate of $1 million a year...

393
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,006
...I'll have to close this place in 60 years.

394
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,559
"With respect to the said newspapers...

395
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,145
...the said Charles Foster Kane...

396
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,857
...hereby relinquishes
all control thereof...

397
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,985
...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

398
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:41,200
...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

399
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,952
...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto..."

400
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,414
KANE: Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.

401
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,041
KANE:
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

402
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,629
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

403
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,091
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

404
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,219
You're too old to be called
anything else.

405
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,554
You were always too old.

406
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,809
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

407
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,728
...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives..."

408
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,438
My allowance.

409
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,401
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

410
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:20,280
...measure of control.
Measure of control."

411
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,992
And we shall seek your advice.

412
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,457
This depression is temporary.

413
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,462
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

414
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,090
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

415
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,634
We never lost as much as we made.

416
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,222
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

417
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,602
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....

418
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,190
To buy things. Hmm?

419
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,819
To buy things.

420
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,741
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

421
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,334
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

422
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,338
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

423
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,718
...if I hadn't been very rich...

424
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,554
...l might have been a really great man.

425
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,890
Don't you think you are?

426
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,103
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

427
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,357
What would you like to have been?

428
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,488
Everything you hate.

429
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,082
- Oh....
- I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

430
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,003
- It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,672
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

432
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,842
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

433
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,263
- You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?

434
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,391
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

435
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,979
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

436
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,234
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

437
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,736
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

438
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,032
We thought maybe.... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

439
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,618
- ...as he was dying.
- That "Rosebud"?

440
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,204
Maybe some girl?

441
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,498
There were a lot of them
in the early days.

442
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,793
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

443
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,128
...and then 50 years later,
on his deathbed...

444
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:45,092
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

445
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,846
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

446
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,639
You take me.

447
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:55,853
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

448
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,189
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

449
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,109
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

450
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,653
A white dress she had on.

451
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,281
She was carrying a white parasol.

452
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,033
I only saw her for one second.

453
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,622
She didn't see me at all,

- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,259
Thank you.

458
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,679
I called her myself the day after he died.

459
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,432
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

460

If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

463
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,904
You were with him from the beginning.

464
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:52,451
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

466
00:31:55,955 --> 00:32:00,167
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

467
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,755
- That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.

468
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,674
Well, it's no trick
to make a lot of money...

470
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,097
...is to make a lot of money.

You take Mr. Kane.

472
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,813
It wasn't money he wanted.

473
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,778
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

474
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,365
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

475
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,534
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

477
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,539
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

478
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,334
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

479

Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

the Inquirer.

in Brooklyn who's missing.

there something about it in the Inquirer?

Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

- The news wasn't big enough.
- Mm-hm.

it makes the news big enough.

- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...

There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

to report the gossip of housewives.

we could fill the paper twice over, daily.
