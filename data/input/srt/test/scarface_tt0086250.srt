00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,651
Okay, they'll
cook you a horse.

463
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,944
I'll eat it.

464
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,202
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

465
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,663
It's nothing. It went
right through me.

466
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,789
It hit the wall.

467
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,166
I ran out of bullets,
like an asshole.

468
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,712
When I changed the clip, a
guy who I thought I killed

469
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,964
wasn't dead and shot me.

470
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,466
The guy was behind me.
I killed him.

How many bullets you catch?

472

Bullets? One bullet.

9mm.

you wouldn't be
too hard to find.

It's the Yiddish

00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,072
You be happy.

622
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,409
Me, I want what's
coming to me.

623
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,994
What's coming to you?

624
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,623
The world, <i>chico,</i>

625
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,002
and everything in it.

626
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,588
Oh, man.

627
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,164
This is paradise.

628
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,959
This is paradise,
I'm telling you.

629
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:52,714
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

630
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,635
I should've come
here 10 years ago.

631
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,554
I'd have been a
millionaire by this time.

632
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,558
By this time, I'd
have had my own boat,

633
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,061
my own car, my
own golf course.

634
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,064
You know what I want? I thought
of this the other day.

635
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,815
A line of blue jeans.

636
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:14,069
With my name written on the
back of chicks' asses.

637
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,863
How's that?

638
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,991
That sounds completely
crazy to me.

639
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,078
Look at that. Look.

640
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,830
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

641
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,207
We're missing the action.

643
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,837
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

644
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,756
Get lost, greaseball!

645
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,592
Look at that. Ice cream?

646
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,427
That's right. You
said "ice cream"?

647
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,553
Girls like ice cream.

648
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,764
Oh, come on. That won't work.

649
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,766
You can't do it that way.

650
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,769
You know how you pick up
chicks in this country?

651
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,817
What was that?
What you just did?

652
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,110
That's what you do.

653
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:56,986
That's disgusting.

654
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,070
Watch.

655
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,949
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

656
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,284
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

657

Figures you wouldn't
understand.

658
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,654
But the women in this country,

659
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,708
when you do that, they know.

660
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,791
They know what?

661
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,752
They understand.
They go crazy.

662
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,214
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

663
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,466
'Cause women love when
you suck the pussy.

664

Yes, you. I've
been watching you.

Take a look over there.
See that man?

Watch that guy. I

I gotta watch my friend.

He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

Oh, look at that.

What I try to tell you?

694
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,543
This country, you gotta
make the money first.

695
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,798
Then when you get the
money, you get the power.

696
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:43,051
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

About time.

701

Frank got held up
at the golf course.

702
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,817
He told me to pick you up.

703
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,070
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

704
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:08,368
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

In that thing? You

dead in that.

Oh, come on.

It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

It looks like
somebody's nightmare.

So, you like this better?

712

Yeah.

713
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,616
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

714
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,869
Tigers, huh? Tigers, no?

715

Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?

716
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,790
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

717
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,625
He says he's gonna buy one.

718
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,295
You do that and you won't
have any friends left.

719
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,713
Not that you have any now.

You're gonna like
that tiger, man.

721

You gonna drive around with a
tiger in your passenger seat?

722
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,137
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

you, you was like that.

He would like to come,

924

He picks it up here.

933
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,010
I can sell it to him
for as little as

934
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:43,390
7,000 a key. You can't
do better than that.

the risk of moving it.

and the Diaz brothers?

1090
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,847
What about Gomez?

1091
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,266
What'll he do when you
start moving 2,000 keys...

1092
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:50,270
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

1093
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,605
Fuck them all!

1094
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,691
I'll bury those cockroaches!

1095
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,028
What they ever do for us?

1096
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,830
Look, Frank, the
time has come.

1097
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:12,000
We gotta expand.

1098
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,670
The whole operation.
Distribution.

1099
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,008
New York, Chicago, LA.

1100
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,554
We gotta set our own
mark and enforce it.

1101
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,140
We gotta think big now.

1102
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,021
Think big.

1103
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,737
Like your friend Sosa.

1104
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,493
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

1105
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,663
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

1106
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:55,418
You turn your back on
him, he'll stick it in.

1107
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,338
You don't trust a
guy like that.

1108
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,092
You want me to believe

1109
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:06,888
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

1110
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:08,932
You bought that line?

1111
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:13,061
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

1112
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,732
Maybe you and Sosa know
something I don't know.

1113
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,028
Like what?

1114
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:24,656
Like what?

1115
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,410
You tell me, "Like what."

1116
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:35,166
You calling me a liar, Frank?

1117
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,961
That what you're calling me?

1118
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,593
Let's just say I want things

1119
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,721
to stay the way
they are for now.

1120
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,643
You stall your deal with Sosa.

1121
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,646
Stall it?

1122
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:02,569
Okay, boss.

1123
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,279
Come on.

1124
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:07,991
I am the boss.

1125
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,535
Sure, you're the boss.

1126
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,786
Hey, Tony.

1127
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,752
Remember I told you
when you started,

1128
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,421
the guys who last
in this business

1129
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,507
are the guys who fly straight,

1130
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,302
low-key, quiet.

1131
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,638
And the guys who want it all,

1132
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,642
chicas, champagne, flash,

1133
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,063
they don't last.

1134
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,857
You finished?

1135
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:42,984
Can I go now?

1136
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,008
Hi, there.

1137
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,975
You just missed Frank.

1138
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,271
Too bad.

1139
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,734
Only I didn't come
to see Frank.

1140
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,197
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

1141
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,157
Next time, make
an appointment.

1142
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,283
That's okay.

1143
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:35,495
I got something important I
want to talk to you about.

1144
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:45,004
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

1145
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:46,840
act normal,

1146
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,969
and just take it easy?

1147
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,680
Come on. I like Scotch.

1148
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,978
Sure. Why not?

1149
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,855
Okay. I won't bite you.

1150
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,526
We're all normal here.

1151
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,992
I heard you and Frank aren't
working together anymore.

1152
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,702
That's right.

1153
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,542
I think it's
easier, don't you?

1154
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,003
Makes things easier.

1155
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:28,673
Thank you.

1156
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,135
Here's to the land
of opportunity.

1157
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:34,637
For you, maybe.

1158
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:40,894
You like kids?

1159
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,855
Kids?

1160
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,733
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

1161
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,570
Sure. Why not?

1162
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,489
As long as there's a nurse.

1163
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:55,533
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

1164
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:01,581
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

1165
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,045
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.

1166
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,047
Come here.

1167
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,096
Sit here.

1168
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,432
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

1169
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:21,267
I'm not gonna bite you.

1170
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,067
Okay, here's the story.

1171
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:35,532
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

1172
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,955
I got no education,
but that's okay.

1173
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,458
I know the street,

1174
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,044
and I'm making all the
right connections.

1175
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,715
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

1176
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,593
I could go right to the top.

1177
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,808
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

1178
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:05,562
I like you.

1179
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,651
I liked you the first
time I laid eyes on you.

1180
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:17,574
I said, "She's a tiger."

1181
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,828
"She'll belong to me."

1182
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,250
Anyway,

1183
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,336
I want you to marry me.

1184
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:36,342
I want you to be the
mother of my children.

1185
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,181
Me? Marry you?

1186
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:43,516
That's right.

What will you do about Frank?

1190
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,945
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

1191
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,867
Just think about it, okay?

1192
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,537
I want you to really
think about it.

1193
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:10,168
I'll go now. Take care.

It's just a disco.

Talk? What are we

No, not lately.

What about ancient history,

The word on the street is you're
bringing in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

1226
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:20,089
That means you're not a
small-time punk anymore,

1227
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,049
you're public property now.

1228

Supreme Court says that your

How much?

01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,894
There's an answer
to that, too.

1232
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,860
Here's how much.

Can you see it?

1234
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,325
Big number. Yeah!

1235
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:50,411
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1236
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,580
You know how this works?

1237
01:19:54,499 --> 01:19:55,917
No. You tell me.

1238
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:58,920
We tell you who's
moving against you,

1239
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,089
and we shake down who
you want shaken down.

1240
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,302
Let's say that you got a real

And then we step in for you.

1244
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,520
Same thing works
the other way.

You feed me a bust
now and then.

So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.

1557
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,008
Fuck you!

1558
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,391
Okay, come on.

1559
01:41:03,475 --> 01:41:05,018
What about Ernie?

1560
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:16,821
You want a job, Ernie?

1561
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:21,659
Sure, Tony.

1562
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:23,536
Okay, then you
call me tomorrow.

1563
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,081
Man, you got a job!

1564
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,834
Tony! Thanks.

1565
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:00,865
Tony.

1566
01:42:05,078 --> 01:42:06,913
God, what's happened?

1567
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,583
Where's Frank?

1568
01:42:12,377 --> 01:42:14,087
Where do you think?

1569
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:22,887
Come on. Get your stuff.

1570
01:42:23,388 --> 01:42:24,931

some kind of thing. Okay.

You propose it, I talk to you.

1577

But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.

1578
01:47:12,427 --> 01:47:15,430
I'm bringing in twice as
much as I ever did before.

We're doing 10 million, 15
million a month. Come on.

That's serious money.

You bank boys gotta
come down a bit.

1582

No way.

1583
01:47:24,522 --> 01:47:26,774
That's crazy. We
can't do that.

1584
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:28,317
Then that's too bad.

1585
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,570
What am I gonna do?

1586
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:31,904
We're not a wholesale
operation.

1587
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:35,658
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me,

1588
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,994
the harder it is
for me to rinse.

1589
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,371
That's a problem.
I didn't know.

1590
01:47:40,455 --> 01:47:43,374
The fact is, I can't take
any more of your money

1591
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,793
unless I raise the
rates on you.

1592
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:49,255
You gonna raise the...
I gotta do it.

01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:53,259
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.

1595
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:54,385
I'm talking.

1596
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,971
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1597
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:58,222
This is business talk.

1598
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,599
Let me explain something.

1599
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:02,143
The IRS is coming down
heavy on South Florida.

1600
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:04,645
There was a <i>TIME</i> magazine
story that didn't help.

1601
01:48:04,729 --> 01:48:06,189
There's a recession.

1602
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,608
I got stockholders I got
to be responsible for.

1603
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:09,817
I got to do it, Tony.

1604
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:11,110
You'll learn from him.

1605
01:48:11,194 --> 01:48:14,572
I got to go 10% on the first 12
million in denominations of 20.

1606
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,657
I'll go 8% on your $10 bills,

1607
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:17,783
6% on your fives.

1608
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:19,660
We'll go somewhere else.
That's it.

1609
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:21,913
There's no place else to go.

1610
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,289
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1611
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:26,375
I'll fly the cash
myself to the Bahamas.

1612
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:29,253
Once, maybe. Then what?

1613
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:32,173
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank

1614
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,342
with 20 million of your
hard-earned dollars?

1615
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,260
Come on, Tony. Don't
be a schmuck.

1616
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:37,929
Who else can you trust?

1617
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,806
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.

1618
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:42,725
Huh?

1619
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,355
Did you hear that guy?

1620
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,399
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1621
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:51,692
Stay with us.

1622
01:48:51,776 --> 01:48:54,862
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1623
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,449
And I got to run.

1624
01:48:58,533 --> 01:48:59,659
I'm safe but poor.

1625
01:49:01,077 --> 01:49:03,037
How's married life
treating you?

1626
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,205

We should talk to this Jewish
guy, Seidelbaum, okay?

1637
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:47,957
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:50,209

this month? The cars?

1642

Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1643
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,455

1644
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:28,706
What?

1645
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,916
That cable truck there.

1646
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,919
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

1647
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,799
What? You been watching
it for three days?

1648
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,012
The thing has been
there for three days.

1649
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:44,889
What am I gonna do,
not look at it?

1650
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:47,141
What, you think
it's cops, right?

1651
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,351
I don't know.

Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

Maybe. I'll check
it out, okay?

1654
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,777
You check it out.

1655
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,364
Then we're gonna blow that
fucking truck back to Colombia!

Come on. We're not the only
dopers living on the block.

That truck could be
anybody and anything.

Here are the keys

Go down there. Give
them the keys!

to say something.

You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

I don't give a fuck.

1667

It's 12% of our
adjusted gross.

1668
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:32,687
12% isn't peanuts.

1669

I don't give a fuck!

1670

That's what counts.

1671
