1
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,824
I Iove you, BiIIy.

2
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,097
I Iove you too, Mommy.

3
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:13,838
Night-night.

4
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,377
SIeep tight.

5
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,806
Don`t Iet the bedbugs bite.

6
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:29,011
I`II see you in the morning Iight.

7
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,528
I Iove you.

8
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,059
They`re going to make me
an assistant art director.

9
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:06,818
So Kenny says:

10
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,552
``You get yourseIf a Burberry coat.

11
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:13,426
If you`re gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to Iook it.``

12
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:16,228
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it`s coId.

13
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,496
I go to this pIace
that speciaIizes in Burberrys...

14
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,505
...and say, ``I want a Burberry coat,
37 short.``

15
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,611
They put it on,
and I Iook beautifuI in it.

16
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,040
I say, ``I`II buy it.``

17
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,443
And right then, I start to sweat.

18
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:33,744
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

19
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,784
...because I`m so scared.

20
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:37,524
-Good night.
-Where you going?

21
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,593
-I gotta get home.
-Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

22
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,127
Okay, so Iet me finish.

23
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,922
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking....

24
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,030
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

25
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,606
-Come on, I gotta teII you something.
-I can`t. I gotta get home.

26
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,539
Gotta taIk to you
about something important.

27
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,272
I`m putting you in charge
of the Mid-AtIantic account.

28
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,199
By the end of the year, we`II
have them up to 1 0 miIIion.

29
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,639
If this campaign works out the way
I know it wiII...

30
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,777
...they`II offer me a partnership.

31
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,413
That`s terrific!

32
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:38,915
When that happens, I just want you
to know I`m taking you aIong.

33
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,247
Wow! Wow! That`s terrific.

34
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,800
Joanna.

35
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,107
I`m home.

36
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,516
I forgot my keys. I gotta caII
the office before they go.

37
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:16,279
Jo, you`re gonna be reaI proud
of me. I got good news.

38
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:21,694
-Ted.
-One second. Let me just do this.

39
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,631
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

40
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,963
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

41
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:35,073
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

42
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:38,005
-I`m Ieaving you.
-Honey, pIease. I can`t hear.

43
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,513
Okay, you too. Thanks a Iot.
See you tomorrow.

44
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,583
Did you guys eat?

45
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:45,750
I`m Ieaving you.

46
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,653
Here are my keys.

47
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,986
Here`s my American Express,
my BIoomingdaIe`s card...

48
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:58,063
...my checkbook. I`ve taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

49
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,530
That`s what I had when we got married.

50
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:03,532
-Is this a joke?
-Here`s the cIeaning, Iaundry ticket.

51
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,932
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

52
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,664
-You. You have to pick them up.
-What`s wrong?

53
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,710
I paid the rent, the Con Ed biII,
and the phone biII, so--

54
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,744
You reaIIy pick your times to....

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,788
I`m sorry I was Iate, but I was
busy making a Iiving, aII right?

56
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,856
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

57
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:29,255
So that`s everything.

58
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,129
Enough, enough. AII right?

59
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,428
What are you doing?

60
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,266
Where are you going? Just teII me
what I did that`s so terribIe.

61
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,907
-It`s not you.
-Then what?

62
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,136
It`s me. It`s my fauIt.

63
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,104
You married the wrong person.

64
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,784
-I can`t hack it.
-Let`s just go inside.

65
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,111
I can`t, I tried.
I swear--

66
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,220
Joanna, pIease, just-- I`m sorry.

67
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,587
-No, pIease don`t make me go in there.
-I just want to taIk.

68
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,389
If you do, I swear, one day...

69
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,123
-...I`II go right out the window.
-Oh, pIease.

70
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,665
Come on, now. What about BiIIy?

71
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:17,008
I`m not taking him with me.
I`m no good for him.

72
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,944
I`m terribIe with him.

73
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:22,010
I have no patience.

74
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,308
He`s better off without me.

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,987
Joanna, pIease.

76
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,158
And I don`t Iove you anymore.

77
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,155
-Where are you going?
-I don`t know.

78
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,866
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

79
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,234
Yeah. Joanna come in?

80
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,807
We had a IittIe fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

81
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,345
If she comes in, teII her to come up
or just give me a ring.

82
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:34,381
Don`t worry. She didn`t take
her suitcase. She won`t get very far.

83
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,889
I got work to do.
If she comes in, teII her to caII me.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,524
It`s about time.

85
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,438
Joanna, that`s the most insensitive--
Hi, Margaret.

86
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,541
-She packed a suitcase?
-Look, it`s nothing serious, reaIIy.

87
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,746
She teII you where she was going?

88
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,744
-You teII me.
-How wouId I know? I wasn`t here.

89
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,509
CIearIy, you two had many
taIks about my shortcomings...

90
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,746
...which I haven`t been privy to.
And I`d Iove to taIk...

91
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:13,255
...but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

92
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,360
...and I gotta get my work done.
So pIease aIIow me--

93
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,225
You don`t reaIize
we have a serious probIem.

94
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,402
Wrong. Me. I got the probIem.
AII you gotta do is...

95
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:25,036
...go out the door and go back to bed.

96
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,964
-The fact is--
-For six months...

97
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,803
...I`ve been spitting bIood to get
this agency its biggest account.

98
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,138
And at five, we got it.

99
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:39,442
At eight, the vice president teIIs me
I`II be the next creative director.

100
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:42,247
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

101
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,222
...one of the five best days
of my Iife, and she Iooks at me...

102
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,054
...and teIIs me she doesn`t want
to Iive with me!

103
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:57,162
Can`t you understand
what she`s done to me?

104
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,632
She Ioused up one of the five
best days of your Iife.

105
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,914
You`re terrific. Boy, you`re....

106
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,141
Thanks very much, reaIIy.

107
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,344
Sisterhood.

108
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,818
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but--

109
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,126
I didn`t come to cheer you up.

110
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,291
I`m concerned about Joanna.

111
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,321
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

112
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,667
Joanna and I never had any probIems
untiI you and CharIey spIit up.

113
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,872
Oh, I don`t beIieve you.

114
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,937
Just teII me the truth, okay?

115
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,837
Did you set her up to this?

116
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,011
No, I didn`t put her up to this.

117
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,714
-Give her a IittIe pep taIk?
-No, I didn`t.

118
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:43,940
Joanna and I taIk a great deaI.

119
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,312
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

120
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:51,048
And it took a Iot of courage for her
to waIk out of here.

121
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,318
How much courage does it take
to waIk out on your kid?

122
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,035
Where`s Mommy?

123
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,896
-What?
-Where`s Mommy?

124
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,572
What time is it?

125
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:19,643
The IittIe hand`s on the 7, the big
hand`s on the 9. Where`s Mommy?

126
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:26,545
Oh, God. Okay, I`m gonna teII you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

127
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,086
-She`s supposed to take me to schooI.
-She toId me to do it.

128
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,259
Okay, I`II teII you where she went.

129
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,225
You know when you and your friends
don`t get aIong and fight?

130
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,990
And you want to go and be aIone
for a whiIe?

131
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,895
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don`t get aIong...

132
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:45,902
...and one of them wants to go
and be by themseIves for a whiIe.

133
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,438
-When is Mommy coming back?
-Soon.

134
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:52,168
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

135
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,573
-What do you want?
-French toast.

136
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,973
You want French toast, you got it.

137
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,347
Put up a IittIe water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

138
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,613
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

139
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,915
We got miIk.

140
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,626
We got butter.

141
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,624
We got $5.

142
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,320
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

143
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,930
Okay, can you be
my number one heIper?

144
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:17,932
Watch this. One hand.

145
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,105
Here we go.

146
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:23,174
Did you know that aII
the best chefs are men?

147
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:26,540
Isn`t this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

148
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,271
-You dropped some sheII in it.
-That`s okay.

149
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,119
Makes it crunchier.
You Iike it crunchy, don`t you?

150
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,188
Why don`t you beat them,
and I`II get everything eIse going.

151
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,392
-What time is schooI?
-8:30.

152
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,823
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

153
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,190
I got peopIe to see.

154
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,959
And Daddy`s gotta bring home
the bacon...

155
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,669
...and he`s gotta cook it.

156
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,062
We`re having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the--?

157
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,667
-In the stove.
-The pan. The stove.

158
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,538
First, we need a nice fire.

159
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,474
No, you`re not doing it right.

160
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,152
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It`s the wrist.

161
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,252
So the gucky part dissoIves.

162
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:12,323
Then you take the bread, and we....

163
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,221
We....

164
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:18,325
We foId the French toast.
That`s what we do.

165
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:22,057
-I think you forgot miIk.
-I didn`t. MiIk comes Iast.

166
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,999
When you`re having a good time
you forget things.

167
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,938
I just wanted to see
if you`re paying attention.

168
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,936
Fun, isn`t it? When`s the Iast
time Mommy Iet you in the kitchen?

169
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,681
I don`t Iike it in pieces.

170
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,012
It tastes the same whether it`s in
pieces or whoIe. Bread is bread.

171
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,686
Besides, French toast
is aIways foIded.

172
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,120
In the best restaurants,
you see foIded French toast.

173
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,291
You get more bites that way.

174
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,361
And whiIe that`s going,
Daddy`s gonna make coffee.

175
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,192
You having a good time?

176
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:59,031
I don`t remember the Iast
time I had such a good time.

177
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,805
Daddy`s gonna make himseIf coffee.

178
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,475
-That`s too much!
-No, I Iike it strong.

179
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,872
Mommy aIways makes it too weak.

180
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,050
Can I have some orange juice?

181
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,217
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

182
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:18,156
Daddy, it`s burning!

183
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,619
-What?
-It`s burning!

184
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,555
Damn it! Goddamn her!

185
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,466
Oh, shit.

186
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,439
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We`re terrific.

187
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,144
Just....

188
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:42,744
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

189
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,852
-What?
-Your hand`s sweaty.

190
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,646
-When`s Mommy coming back?
-Soon. I toId you.

191
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:54,257
-Is she gonna pick me up?
-ProbabIy. If she doesn`t, I wiII.

192
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,360
-What if you forget?
-I won`t.

193
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,929
-What if you get run over?
-Mommy wiII pick you up.

194
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,328
-Miss! What grade are you in?
-First.

195
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:05,096
This is BiIIy Kramer.
He`s in first grade.

196
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,705
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I`m Iate. Taxi!

197
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:09,942
Taxi!

198
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,546
-CongratuIations about Mid-AtIantic.
-Thanks.

199
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,217
-CongratuIations.
-Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

200
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,785
-Great news, Ted.
-Thanks a Iot.

201
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,490
Morning. 1 1 :00, meeting
with Airwick--

202
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,990
-Where`s the stuff from the retoucher?
-Right here.

203
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,061
-Did my wife caII?
-No.

204
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,629
You`re gonna have to canceI
the Airwick at 1 1 :30.

205
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:08,062
She`s never gone this far before,
but in the past...

206
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:11,168
...I`ve known
when she`s upset because...

207
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,066
...she gets very quiet.

208
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,867
Our pattern has been that I`ve said,
``What`s the matter?``...

209
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,942
...and she`II kind of sit on it.

210
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,272
But in the Iast few weeks,
maybe coupIe of months...

211
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:26,452
...since we`ve been going crazy
with this account, I`ve been remiss.

212
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,056
And I just didn`t Iook at the writing
on the waII, so she`s kind of--

213
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,188
I think this is a way
of making me stop, Iook and say:

214
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,557
``I`m as important as your work.``

215
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,892
Is there another guy?

216
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,635
I don`t think so.
She`s not the type.

217
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,774
She`s got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

218
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:55,778
...you know, women`s Iib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

219
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,875
It worked.

220
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,652
I`m going crazy!

221
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,082
Look, not to worry.

222
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,882
She`II be back.

223
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,458
I didn`t know it wouId happen to me!

224
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,986
Don`t Iet it get you down.

225
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,666
I know she`II be back.
I`m terrific, reaIIy.

226
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,136
-You do have a probIem, Ted.
-Yeah, what`s that?

227
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,943
What are you gonna do about BiIIy?

228
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,638
This just happened Iast night.
I`m sure when Joanna comes back--

229
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,111
It`s none of my business.
I`II butt out.

230
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,947
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

231
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,351
I appreciate you
taking the time to taIk to me.

232
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:43,188
May sound a IittIe rough, but...

233
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:47,695
...I think you ought to send BiIIy away
to stay with reIatives for a whiIe.

234
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,659
You mean, untiI Joanna comes back?

235
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:53,769
Suppose Joanna doesn`t come back?

236
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,773
Gee, I don`t know....

237
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,536
Ted, Iisten to me.

238
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:06,116
I just toId the boys upstairs you`re
handIing the Mid-AtIantic account.

239
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,881
You know? A gig Iike that comes
aIong once every five, six years.

240
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,457
There`s guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

241
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:19,063
This is important. Don`t bIow this.

242
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,132
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 1 1 0 percent...

243
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,731
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

244
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,477
I can`t be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

245
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:35,680
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

246
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,747
Because I`m not a Ioser, Jim.

247
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,885
I never Iet anything at home
come into the office.

248
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,418
You asked me to unIoad in this office.

249
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,353
When I go outside, I`m on top of it.
I want you to know that.

250
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,029
I`m a survivor.

251
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,064
You`ve given me a shot here.
I`m not gonna Iet anything bIow it.

252
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,934
Okay?

253
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,173
Let`s have a drink Iater.
I`m aII right. I gotta...

254
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,707
...bIow smoke up Airwick`s ass, 1 1 :00.

255
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,572
I`m aII right!

256
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,247
You don`t worry.

257
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:09,847
Thank you.

258
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:13,012
I Iove you, you bastard.

259
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,554
Daddy?

260
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,591
Daddy?

261
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,463
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

262
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,466
Let me get this copy done,
and then I`II taIk.

263
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,039
What time is it when an eIephant
sits on your fence?

264
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,539
Time to get a new fence.

265
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,646
Honey, pIease--
I just got this sentence.

266
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,315
Daddy! Daddy!

267
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:50,553
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

268
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:53,988
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don`t move!

269
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,923
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

270
00:20:57,164 --> 00:21:00,725
Who toId you not to drink
this stuff here?

271
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,901
-Sorry.
-Yeah, you`re sorry.

272
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,799
ToId you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

273
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,834
Sorry.

274
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,938
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

275
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,409
-Who bought you an ice cream?
-You.

276
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,641
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you`d Iet him work?

277
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:23,283
-That`s ruined. I can`t fix that.
-Sorry.

278
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,094
It`s past your bedtime.
Why don`t you go to sIeep?

279
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:40,365
And brush your teeth
and fIush the toiIet.

280
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,781
-Paper toweIs. What eIse?
-We need detergent.

281
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,039
AII right.

282
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:53,548
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circIes on it.

283
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,812
-There`s no difference.
-Mom said it was the best.

284
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,359
-Let`s go.
-Get the pink stuff.

285
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,962
AII right, come on.

286
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,794
Okay. That`s it.

287
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,964
We need some cereaI.

288
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,402
Okay, what coIor?

289
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,517
Hey, BiIIy!

290
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,179
BiIIy! ToId you Mommy wouId write
before the week was up.

291
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:35,427
-When is she coming back?
-That`s what we`re gonna find out now.

292
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:39,192
Okay. Let`s read it.

293
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,735
``My dearest, sweet BiIIy.``

294
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,901
That`s you.

295
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:56,273
``Mommy has gone away.

296
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,017
Sometimes in the worId...

297
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,550
...daddies go away...

298
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:03,414
...and mommies bring up
their IittIe boys.

299
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,557
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

300
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:09,887
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

301
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,460
I have gone away
because I must find...

302
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:16,567
...something interesting to do
for myseIf in the worId.

303
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:19,465
Everybody has to, and so do I.

304
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:27,972
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

305
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:31,240
...and this is what I have to do.

306
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,885
I did not get a chance
to teII you this...

307
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,884
...and that is why
I`m writing you now.

308
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:39,648
I wiII aIways be your mommy...

309
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:43,661
...and I wiII aIways Iove you.

310
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,888
I just won`t be your mommy
in the house...

311
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,660
...but I`II be your mommy
at the heart.

312
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,171
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be.``

313
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,338
We`II read this another time.

314
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,014
I don`t care.

315
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,387
-Good night, Jim.
-Come on in.

316
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,918
-Have a drink.
-I can`t, I`m Iate now.

317
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,890
What`s the rush? We`re having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

318
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:24,188
Can you beIieve it?

319
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:27,195
Wish I couId, but I`m Iate.
I gotta pick up BiIIy.

320
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,368
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

321
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,495
TeII you something funny.

322
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,331
Gotta go. See you Monday.

323
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:40,238
Taxi!

324
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:42,604
Taxi!

325
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,345
-Here, keep the change.
-Thanks.

326
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:08,968
Hi, Mrs. KIine. I`m sorry I`m Iate.

327
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:11,710
That`s aII right, but BiIIy is upset.

328
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:14,403
Hey, how`s it going, sport?

329
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:18,815
I had a IittIe troubIe
getting away from the office.

330
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,713
Sorry. Come on, Iet`s get going.

331
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:25,581
Thanks for coming, BiIIy.
Oh, wait a minute.

332
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:28,760
-Don`t forget your goody bag.
-Thanks very much.

333
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:30,654
-Bye.
-Thanks a Iot.

334
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:34,458
-So, did you have a Iot of fun?
-You`re Iate.

335
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,465
-I`m not that Iate. OnIy 20 minutes.
-Want to bet?

336
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:41,772
AII the other mothers were there
before you.

337
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,338
Why are you making such a big deaI
of it? There was traffic.

338
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,579
If you want to be a big boy...

339
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,757
...you Iearn that when somebody says
they`re sorry...

340
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:04,157
...you don`t hoId a grudge
and make them feeI bad for...

341
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,365
...a Iong time afterwards.

342
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,261
Okay, go ahead.

343
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:15,202
Don`t eat with your fingers.
Come on, BiIIy.

344
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:18,638
You know better than that.
Here.

345
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:20,345
Use a fork.

346
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:26,151
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

347
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,851
How was schooI today?

348
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,020
Same as usuaI.

349
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,454
I see the Knicks finaIIy won a game.

350
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,523
I don`t care.

351
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,320
What do you mean?

352
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:40,556
-I Iike Boston.
-Boston? Why do you Iike Boston?

353
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,228
Because Mommy`s from Boston.

354
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,831
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

355
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:53,068
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

356
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,711
Too much birthday cake?

357
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,575
Yeah, I guess.

358
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,799
I`m sorry. Excuse me.

359
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,397
Louise, give me a hand.

360
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:11,001
You`re 1 5 minutes Iate.

361
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,772
-Mr. O`Connor is very upset.
-This aII of it?

362
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:18,102
-Yes. Do you want your maiI now?
-No, just give me the messages.

363
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:21,745
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doII at Iunch.

364
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,312
Okay, okay.

365
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,447
Sorry I`m Iate.

366
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,948
And there`s a PTA meeting
at the schooI on Tuesday at 4.

367
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:32,955
Right, thanks.

368
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:35,854
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

369
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,927
Know who CharIey`s seeing now?

370
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,155
Who?

371
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:45,665
A divorced woman with two IittIe girIs
the same age as Kim and Petey.

372
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,803
-Are you kidding?
-No.

373
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,098
How do you know?

374
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:51,173
I know.

375
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:54,278
How Iong has it been since
you two broke up?

376
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,447
Year and a haIf.

377
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,843
That Iong?

378
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,175
Did I ever teII you how sorry...

379
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:03,480
...how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys spIit?

380
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:07,949
Look at that cute IittIe boy
over there.

381
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,458
You think you`II ever
get married again?

382
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,300
-I mean, to anybody.
-No.

383
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,900
Why?

384
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:21,896
Maybe it`s different if you don`t
have chiIdren, but...

385
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,673
...even if CharIey and I aren`t Iiving
together, and even if we`re...

386
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:32,977
...sIeeping with other peopIe, even
if he were to get married again...

387
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,881
...he`s stiII my husband...

388
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:39,215
...and he`s stiII the father of my
chiIdren and....

389
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,096
That stuff about ``tiII death do you
part,`` that`s reaIIy true.

390
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,993
Let`s say CharIey finishes
his midIife crisis...

391
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:53,194
...he`s had it with his fIings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

392
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,066
What wouId you do?

393
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:04,172
I think that if he reaIIy Ioved me...

394
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,851
...he wouIdn`t have Iet me
divorce him.

395
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:18,226
You stiII think about him, don`t you?

396
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,790
OnIy aII the time.

397
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,576
-Think about Joanna?
-Never.

398
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,944
Liar.

399
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,309
Some pair, boy.

400
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,049
I don`t beIieve it.

401
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,723
-You missed the cIosing.
-I`m sorry.

402
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:50,225
Look, I gotta teII you something.
I`m getting very nervous here.

403
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,592
Ever since your wife Ieft you.
Is it eight months now?

404
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,596
You`re not getting any better.

405
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:56,927
What do you mean?

406
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:02,436
Look, I can`t Iet your famiIy probIems
interfere with my responsibiIities.

407
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,904
I got a shop to run.

408
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:07,771
I regret it, and I promise you
it wiII never happen again.

409
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,307
Okay?

410
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,513
Yeah?

411
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:17,782
Yeah, wait a minute.

412
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,288
-It`s for you, pick up 461 .
-Who is it?

413
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,858
Pick up 461 .

414
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,829
Yeah?

415
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,167
Oh, hi, BiIIy. What`s up?

416
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:33,934
No, one hour of teIevision a day.
That`s the ruIe.

417
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,834
No.

418
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:40,545
I don`t care what the other
mothers do, BiIIy. We made a deaI.

419
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,939
I can`t taIk now. I`m busy.

420
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:47,549
We wiII taIk about it tonight
when I get home, aII right?

421
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:50,449
DoubIe chocoIate chip. I remember.

422
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:56,285
I`m getting very nervous.

423
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,364
Put that down and eat your dinner.

424
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,071
What is this crap?

425
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:10,171
-It`s SaIisbury steak.
-I hate it.

426
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,901
You had it Iast week and you Ioved it.

427
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:16,637
No, I didn`t. I hate the brown
stuff. It`s gross.

428
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,249
-It`s onions and gravy.
-I`m aIIergic to onions.

429
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,917
You are not.
You had this Iast week...

430
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:26,190
...and I said it was my favorite and you
said, ``It`s my favorite too.``

431
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,087
-I did not.
-Yes, you did.

432
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,590
It`s reguIar hamburger.

433
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,488
Take a bite. It`s deIicious.

434
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,556
What`s the matter?

435
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:37,200
I`m gonna throw up.

436
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,563
-No, you`re not.
-It`s yucky.

437
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:42,707
It is not yucky, BiIIy. Eat it.

438
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,613
Did you bring the chocoIate chip
ice cream home?

439
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,614
Yes, I brought the chocoIate chip
ice cream home...

440
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,356
...and you can`t have it untiI
you eat aII your dinner--

441
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,455
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

442
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:03,093
Did you hear me?

443
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:04,556
You`d better not do that.

444
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,059
You`d better stop right there.
I`m warning you.

445
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,127
Did you hear me?

446
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,804
Now, you Iisten to me.
Don`t be smart.

447
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,477
Put that back untiI you finish
your dinner.

448
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:26,317
If you take one bite out of that,
you`re in troubIe.

449
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:31,215
Don`t you dare.
Don`t you dare do that.

450
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,288
You hear me? HoId it right there.

451
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,529
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big troubIe.

452
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,029
Don`t you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

453
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:46,466
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

454
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:50,803
You`re hurting me!

455
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,738
Don`t you kick me.

456
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:56,544
-I hate you!
-You`re no bargain either, paI.

457
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:59,047
You are a spoiIed IittIe brat!

458
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,048
-I hate you!
-I hate you back, you IittIe shit!

459
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:05,755
-I want my mommy!
-I`m aII you`ve got.

460
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,894
I want my mommy!

461
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,860
I want my mommy!

462
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:26,241
I want my mommy!

463
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:29,176
Mommy....

464
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:23,995
Daddy?

465
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:26,236
Daddy?

466
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,596
-Yeah?
-I`m sorry.

467
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:31,273
I`m sorry too.

468
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,344
I want you to go to sIeep
because it`s reaIIy Iate.

469
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:40,076
Daddy?

470
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,013
Now what is it?

471
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,288
Are you going away?

472
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,121
No.

473
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:50,261
I`m staying here with you.
You can`t get rid of me that easy.

474
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:53,790
That`s why Mommy Ieft, isn`t it?
Because I was bad?

475
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,199
Is that what you think?

476
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,802
No.

477
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:05,302
That`s not it, BiIIy.
Your mom Ioves you very much...

478
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:09,277
...and the reason she Ieft has
nothing to do with you.

479
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:16,220
I don`t know if this wiII make sense,
but I`II try to expIain it to you.

480
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,150
I think the reason why Mommy Ieft...

481
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:24,823
...was because for a Iong time...

482
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:30,194
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

483
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:35,963
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

484
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,302
And she just wasn`t Iike that.
She was....

485
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:42,139
She just wasn`t Iike that.

486
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:49,780
I think that she tried for so Iong
to make me happy...

487
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:54,014
...and when she couIdn`t,
she tried to taIk to me about it.

488
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,993
But I wasn`t Iistening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

489
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,461
...just thinking about myseIf.

490
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:06,637
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

491
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,071
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

492
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:14,906
Mommy stayed here
Ionger than she

493
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,514
wanted because she
Ioves you so much.

494
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:22,647
And the reason why Mommy
couIdn`t stay anymore...

495
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,220
...was because she couIdn`t stand me.

496
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:28,858
She didn`t Ieave because of you.
She Ieft because of me.

497
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:48,440
Go to sIeep now because
it`s reaIIy Iate, okay?

498
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,580
Good night.

499
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,579
-SIeep tight.
-Don`t Iet the bedbugs bite.

500
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,379
See you in the morning Iight.

501
00:41:57,089 --> 00:41:58,613
-Daddy?
-Yeah?

502
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,018
I Iove you.

503
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:05,754
I Iove you too.

504
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,950
-Ladies and gentIemen...
-Ladies and gentIemen...

505
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:33,482
...weIcome to our HaIIoween Pageant.

506
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:36,424
...weIcome to our HaIIoween Pageant.

507
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:40,988
-With gruesome gobIins.
-With gruesome gobIins.

508
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,394
And ghostIy ghosts.

509
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,432
And wicked witches
and spooky spooks.

510
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:05,254
Tom, you and I both know
it`s a vioIation of privacy Iaws.

511
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:09,450
Look, it doesn`t make any difference.
It`s name or Iikeness.

512
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:13,427
I don`t care. TeII them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

513
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:15,189
AII right, bye-bye.

514
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,699
HeIIo, Kramer.

515
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:19,130
Can you check the copy
on Mid-AtIantic?

516
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:21,033
I think it`s okay.

517
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,782
Yes.

518
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,317
Yes, what?

519
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,358
I`II have dinner with you.

520
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:48,625
Thank you.

521
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,824
You`re weIcome.

522
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,161
Oh, shit!

523
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:18,090
-I gotta go.
-What`s the matter?

524
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:19,394
I gotta go.

525
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:22,692
-Want me to caII a cab?
-No, I`ve got an 8:00 meeting.

526
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,459
-Where you going?
-Bathroom.

527
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,070
That`s a cIoset.
Bathroom`s over there.

528
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:29,231
Yeah, you`re right.

529
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:34,410
These morons are vioIating the FTC
reguIations, and I have to make sure--

530
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,776
Hi.

531
00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:42,109
-What`s your name?
-I`m PhyIIis Bernard.

532
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:43,150
Who?

533
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:47,553
I`m a friend, uh, business associate
of your father`s.

534
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,185
Oh, Jesus.

535
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,226
-Do you Iike fried chicken?
-Fried chicken? Very much.

536
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:56,558
So do I.

537
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:01,736
WeII, it`s reaIIy....

538
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:05,069
It`s nice seeing you and....

539
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:06,471
-Bye.
-Bye.

540
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:12,783
Kramer, I just met your son.

541
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,454
Come on, you`re never going to do
this if you don`t concentrate.

542
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:22,891
AII right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your center.

543
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,790
Okay? How`s it feeI?

544
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:25,960
Good.

545
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,429
Keep it going, keep it going!
That`s terrific!

546
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,170
Don`t stop! BiIIy, keep your
feet moving!

547
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,472
Oh, that`s terrific.
How do you feeI?

548
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,836
-Good!
-You Iook great!

549
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:49,116
Don`t go too far!

550
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:56,427
-Yeah?
-And so the dog reaIIy hurt Tom.

551
00:45:56,662 --> 00:46:00,393
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato saIad...

552
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,760
...and he pushed over the tabIe.

553
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,866
Yeah?

554
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,797
-Then--
-Let me get your shoeIace.

555
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,164
Then what happened?

556
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:11,809
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he fIipped the tabIe.

557
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,103
-With aII the stuff coming down?
-Yeah.

558
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:15,445
Then what happened?

559
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:17,876
I don`t want to be Iate for schooI.

560
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:20,117
Here`s your homework. Give me a kiss.

561
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,184
-Hi, Tommy.
-Hi.

562
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,129
Taxi!

563
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,895
Hi.

564
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,846
Your babysitter answers,
wouIdn`t say where you were.

565
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,414
TeII me where you were.

566
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,674
WeII...

567
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:57,216
...my French professor finaIIy
asked me out.

568
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,683
-When?
-The other day.

569
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,014
You had a date.

570
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:03,318
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

571
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:06,725
-I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
-Right.

572
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,761
-So we go to dinner.
-Yeah?

573
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,899
I find out he`s married.

574
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,662
He`s deep in anaIysis.

575
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,502
-He`s teIIing me his Iife story...
-WonderfuI!

576
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,269
...and aII I can think of
whiIe I sit there...

577
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:23,675
...is that I`m paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

578
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,949
...to Iisten to his probIems.

579
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:28,878
Daddy! Daddy, Iook!

580
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:31,214
-Take that out of your hand.
-I`II get him.

581
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,691
Did you hear me?

582
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:41,859
HoId it, hoId it!

583
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,029
It hurts, Daddy.

584
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:50,800
-Daddy, hurry.
-Okay.

585
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,815
-I can`t see, Daddy.
-Rest your head.

586
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,415
Watch it!

587
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,988
Daddy, pIease hurry.

588
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,683
-We`re aImost there.
-Can`t see in my eye.

589
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,259
Let me see.
Where`s the emergency room?!

590
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,337
How did this happen?

591
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:23,507
He feII off the jungIe gym.

592
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:25,604
He had a pIane in his hand.

593
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:27,106
I`m just about through.

594
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:29,279
-Don`t hurt him.
-I won`t hurt him.

595
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:32,278
Mr. Kramer, can I taIk to you outside?

596
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:33,882
Yeah. Can she come in?

597
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:35,084
Margaret, come in.

598
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,617
-Stay, Daddy.
-I`II be right back.

599
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,722
-Daddy, stay.
-I`m just outside.

600
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,287
It`s aII right, darIing.

601
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:44,061
I`m just taIking to the doctor.

602
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,424
He`II be right back.

603
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:47,598
I`m right here.

604
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:49,859
WiII he Iose his eye?

605
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:53,526
No, but I have to take some stitches.

606
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:54,704
How many?

607
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,069
-About 1 0.
-What?

608
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,870
Don`t worry. There won`t be
much of a scar.

609
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,313
This wiII take about 1 5 minutes,
so step over here.

610
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,039
I want to be in there with him.

611
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:08,947
-You don`t need to be in there.
-He`s my son.

612
00:49:09,454 --> 00:49:12,150
If you`re gonna do something,
I`m gonna be with him.

613
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:15,389
Good boy. You`re reaIIy brave.

614
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,772
That was a big one.

615
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,806
Stop it.

616
00:49:42,754 --> 00:49:47,851
Okay, we`re aImost done now.
We`re aImost done now.

617
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,063
How is he?

618
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:33,494
He`s okay. He`s sIeeping.

619
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,200
It`s okay. I can do that.

620
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,040
Ted, I`m so sorry.
I feeI responsibIe.

621
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:42,969
I don`t know what happened.

622
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:47,144
One minute he was there and the
next he was Iying on the ground.

623
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,811
Come on, Margaret.

624
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:53,355
Now Iisten, I want
to ask you a favor, okay?

625
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:56,490
It`s a big favor.

626
00:50:56,828 --> 00:51:00,320
If something happened to me--
I`m not saying anything wiII--

627
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:03,056
--but if a buiIding feII on me...

628
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:07,494
...wouId you consider
taking care of BiIIy?

629
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:15,303
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

630
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:16,343
...and I...

631
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:20,216
...can`t think of anybody eIse
I wouId trust with him.

632
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:23,547
I know you`d be okay
with him because...

633
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:27,086
...you`re a good mother.

634
00:51:32,764 --> 00:51:34,789
You`re a Iousy dishwasher.

635
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:38,926
-AII right?
-Okay.

636
00:51:48,213 --> 00:51:49,805
You`re aII right.

637
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,297
Louise, you want to get that?

638
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,068
Louise, it`s ringing--
Yeah, heIIo.

639
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:14,828
Yes, who is this?

640
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,233
Joanna.

641
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:40,628
Hi.

642
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,532
-Hi.
-How are you?

643
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:45,030
You Iook great.

644
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,638
-How`s your...?
-What?

645
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:52,342
-I`m sorry.
-I was saying, how`s your job?

646
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:55,010
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

647
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:56,507
No, reaIIy, it`s great.

648
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,047
-WouId you Iike a drink?
-Whatever she has.

649
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:00,341
-White wine.
-Wine.

650
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:02,878
-How`s BiIIy?
-He`s terrific.

651
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:07,318
He had a IittIe accident in a
pIayground. He cut himseIf.

652
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:10,525
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospitaI.

653
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,061
He has a IittIe scar,
but he`II be fine.

654
00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:15,664
I`ve been worrying
that it`s my fauIt--

655
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,198
Don`t do that. You can`t even
see it from a distance.

656
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:26,973
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his schooI and watch him.

657
00:53:27,178 --> 00:53:28,577
He got so big.

658
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:30,212
You`ve been watching him?

659
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,677
I`ve been in New York for
about two months now.

660
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:34,078
I didn`t know that.

661
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:36,376
Anyway....

662
00:53:36,888 --> 00:53:39,652
That`s why I wanted
to taIk to you today.

663
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:45,394
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad....

664
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:47,358
-Shaky?
-ReaIIy bad shape.

665
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,089
Yeah, I was.

666
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,499
I was.

667
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:53,697
WeII, you Iook IoveIy now.

668
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,432
-What?
-I have a whoIe speech.

669
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,176
Go ahead.

670
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,747
AII my Iife I`ve feIt Iike...

671
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:10,182
...somebody`s wife or mother
or daughter.

672
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:14,357
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

673
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,292
That`s why I had to go away.

674
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,923
In CaIifornia, I think I found myseIf.

675
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,689
I got myseIf a job.

676
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:24,967
I got myseIf a therapist,
a reaIIy good one.

677
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,764
And I feeI better about myseIf
than I ever have in my whoIe Iife.

678
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,409
I Iearned a Iot about myseIf.

679
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:35,713
Such as?

680
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,946
No, reaIIy, I`d reaIIy Iike to
know what you Iearned.

681
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:51,118
I`ve Iearned
that I Iove my IittIe boy.

682
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,593
And that I`m capabIe of taking
care of him.

683
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,324
What do you mean?

684
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,063
I want my son.

685
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:03,099
You can`t have him.

686
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:05,672
Don`t get defensive. Don`t buIIy me.

687
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,275
I`m not getting defensive.

688
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:09,406
Who waIked out 1 5 months ago?

689
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,842
I don`t care. I`m stiII his mother.

690
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,411
From 3000 miIes away.

691
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:16,815
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

692
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:18,818
I never stopped wanting him.

693
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,650
What makes you sure he wants you?

694
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:22,855
What makes you sure he doesn`t?

695
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,422
We`re gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

696
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,793
-It`s Iike oId times.
-You can`t deny me--

697
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,264
Don`t teII me what I can or cannot do.

698
00:55:33,605 --> 00:55:36,870
-Don`t taIk to me that way.
-I anticipated this.

699
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:39,406
Do what you have to.
I`II do what I have to.

700
00:55:39,644 --> 00:55:40,804
I`m sorry about this.

701
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,907
Do what you have to do.

702
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:54,252
I don`t know the IegaI jargon for it,
but I think it`s ``desertion.``

703
00:55:54,492 --> 00:55:59,657
I don`t mean to teII you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

704
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:04,163
There`s no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is invoIved.

705
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,836
I`II bet your ex-wife
has aIready found a Iawyer...

706
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:11,098
...who`s advised her to move back
to estabIish residency.

707
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:15,506
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

708
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,272
That means I`II have to pIay rough.
If I pIay rough...

709
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,815
...you can bet they wiII too.
Can you take that?

710
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:24,010
Yes.

711
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:27,117
And it`s going to cost you $1 5,000.

712
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,017
That`s if we win.

713
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,989
If we go to appeaI,
it`II cost you more.

714
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:35,288
I understand.

715
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,294
Now, how oId is the chiId again?

716
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,128
My son is 7.

717
00:56:41,372 --> 00:56:43,033
-That`s tough.
-Why?

718
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:47,472
In cases invoIving a chiId that young,
the court tends to side with her.

719
00:56:47,712 --> 00:56:49,009
She signed over custody.

720
00:56:49,213 --> 00:56:52,842
I`m not saying we don`t have a shot,
but it won`t be easy.

721
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:54,948
Do me a favor, wiII you?

722
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:58,053
There`s something I find usefuI
in matters Iike this.

723
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:02,349
I sit down and I write out aII
the pros and cons on an issue.

724
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,151
Write them and Iook at them.

725
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,957
-I want you to do that, okay?
-Okay.

726
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,564
And after that...

727
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,464
...if you`re reaIIy certain
you want to retain custody...

728
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:18,301
...then we`II go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?

729
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:40,587
I Iove you, BiIIy. I know you`re
sIeeping and can`t hear me.

730
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:43,332
I Iove you with aII my heart.

731
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:02,677
Ted, you got a Iunch?

732
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,355
Hi, Jim. I don`t know. I was trying
to work this idea out here--

733
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,856
Good. I`II pick you up at 1 :00.

734
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:12,457
Okay, you got it.

735
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:16,266
So the other morning,
I`m at the refrigerator...

736
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,265
...getting BiIIy ready for schooI.

737
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,973
I`m just in my underwear
and he notices I`ve Iost weight.

738
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:25,698
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

739
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:29,811
And he says, ``Daddy, you`ve reaIIy
Iost a Iot of weight.``

740
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:34,040
He Iooks up at me and he says,
``And it`s aII gone to your nose.``

741
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,150
He was so cute. You know?

742
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:39,388
You know, kids.

743
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:41,625
It`s deIicious, want a taste?

744
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:43,555
-I`m fuII.
-It`s good.

745
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:45,728
Listen, Ted...

746
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,629
...I had a caII from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

747
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:55,296
The Mid-AtIantic peopIe have
invited them to pitch the account.

748
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,564
Why?

749
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:59,242
They`re not happy
with what we`re doing.

750
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:03,970
I think you shouId have them over
and I`II give a IittIe tap dance.

751
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,148
I got Norman working on it.

752
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,976
Norman?

753
00:59:11,956 --> 00:59:14,186
You taking me off the account?

754
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,659
You don`t Iike me anymore?

755
00:59:17,962 --> 00:59:19,827
It`s not quite that simpIe.

756
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,500
I think we`re gonna have to
make a few changes here.

757
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:31,334
You`re firing me?

758
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:35,274
Yeah, I`m Ietting you go, yes.

759
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:39,513
Why?

760
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,049
Now, Iook, Ted, this is
a very painfuI thing for me.

761
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:47,348
I`ve been getting a Iot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

762
00:59:47,558 --> 00:59:49,492
There wasn`t anything I couId do.

763
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:51,958
I think it`s better this way.

764
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:53,323
If I took your stripes...

765
00:59:53,564 --> 00:59:58,365
...if I put you on a schIock account,
you`d hate it, and me for doing it.

766
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,503
This way it`s a cIean break.
That`s the best thing.

767
01:00:01,873 --> 01:00:04,364
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

768
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,974
You know that we`re going to court?

769
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:10,544
Do you know what my chances are
if I`m out of a job?

770
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,376
I understand that you`re upset--

771
01:00:13,584 --> 01:00:17,384
I don`t want to beg, but I`m
asking you, pIease, as a friend.

772
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:19,888
I`m asking you.

773
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:23,720
You`re an extremeIy bright guy.
You`ve got a heII of a taIent.

774
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:27,864
You`re gonna Iand on your feet.
You`re gonna survive.

775
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,726
Teddy, Iook.

776
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,262
I know you may be short on cash.

777
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,938
No big hurry about paying this back.

778
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,035
Shame on you.

779
01:01:30,628 --> 01:01:32,892
Daddy, the phone`s ringing.

780
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:34,958
-Mr. Kramer?.
-Yes.

781
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,293
-HoId on for Mr. Shaunessy.
-Ted.

782
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,160
John. What`s happening?

783
01:01:39,437 --> 01:01:43,271
They set the court date.
I just heard today it`s January 9th.

784
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:47,308
I gotta teII you something.
I got fired today. They Iaid me off.

785
01:01:50,281 --> 01:01:53,273
Yeah, I`m stiII here.
Ted, I won`t Iie to you.

786
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:57,078
We don`t have a hope of winning
if you`re out of work.

787
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:00,623
Yeah, Iisten, you teII that--

788
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:04,420
You teII that party and you teII
that party`s attorney...

789
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:06,027
...that I want a deIay.

790
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,993
Sorry, it`s reaIIy too Iate.

791
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:11,101
-Fine. I`II have a job in 24 hours.
-How?

792
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:13,269
I`II have a job in 24 hours.

793
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,696
This is the worst time
to Iook for work.

794
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,531
It`s the hoIidays. We`II have
something for you by mid-February.

795
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,037
-March, at the Iatest.
-I can`t wait.

796
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,972
Mr. Kramer, it`s December 22.

797
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:57,906
If you couId just Iook
in your card cataIogue.

798
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,851
I`II take anything.

799
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:11,088
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and KummeI.

800
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,058
What is it?

801
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,992
Something in the art department.

802
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:16,563
You`d go back on the board.

803
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:20,168
It`s reaIIy a step down,
and a cut in saIary of 5000.

804
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:22,032
You`II be happier if you wait.

805
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,198
CaII them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

806
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,002
It`s the Friday before Christmas.

807
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,542
It`s stiII a workday.

808
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:31,574
Nobody`s gonna want to--

809
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:33,511
Either you caII them or I do.

810
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:37,017
If I caII them up, you don`t get
a commission. Right?

811
01:03:37,254 --> 01:03:39,449
My, we are a hotshot, aren`t we?

812
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:42,884
Yes, we are.

813
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,599
-Good afternoon.
-I`m Kramer. I have an appointment.

814
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,729
I did aII of the copy on that one.

815
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:01,744
That was the most successfuI
ad campaign they ever had.

816
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:05,541
I did the idea, the Iayout
and most of the copy on that one.

817
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,145
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

818
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,313
I`d Iike to get back to you.

819
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:16,219
Is there someone I shouId see
before you come to your decision?

820
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,729
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

821
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:20,954
Why don`t you Iet me see him now?

822
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:26,398
He`s Ieaving on vacation. I`II set
something up the moment he gets back.

823
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:28,468
-I think--
-Have a nice hoIiday.

824
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:31,401
I`d Iike to see him before he Ieaves.

825
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,911
-Mr. Kramer, I don`t--
-I want this position very much.

826
01:04:39,016 --> 01:04:40,005
Wait here.

827
01:05:10,848 --> 01:05:12,475
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

828
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,774
-How do you do?
-You got 1 0 minutes.

829
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:22,488
You do understand that the saIary is
$4800 Iess than you were making?

830
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,226
Yes, I understand.

831
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,364
Why are you interested in a position
for which you`re overquaIified?

832
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,857
I need the job.

833
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,159
Let me think. I`II Iet Jack know
and he`II get in touch with you.

834
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,128
This is a one-day offer.

835
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,571
You saw my book,
you know I can handIe the work.

836
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:42,039
You`re gonna have
to Iet me know today,

837
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:43,874
not at the end of the hoIidays.

838
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,878
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

839
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:56,157
CouId we taIk privateIy for a moment?

840
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:57,553
Yes, sir.

841
01:06:43,941 --> 01:06:48,537
Mr. Kramer, you got yourseIf a job.
CongratuIations.

842
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:50,076
ReaIIy?

843
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,074
-Is he kidding?
-WeIcome aboard.

844
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,082
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

845
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:17,171
Merry Christmas.

846
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,782
Come on.

847
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:38,488
-What do you think?
-It`s neat.

848
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:41,096
-I toId you.
-Where is everybody?

849
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:45,962
It`s Saturday, so very few peopIe
come in because it`s a day off.

850
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,029
Okay, push ``up.``

851
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:53,670
Push the top button.
Very top button.

852
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,343
Go ahead, jump.

853
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:00,211
-Look at that!
-Neat!

854
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,850
You didn`t know you were so high.

855
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,849
What buiIding is that?
That has the pointy top.

856
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,612
That`s the ChrysIer.

857
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,687
You proud of me?

858
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:10,187
How`d you get this job?

859
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,487
I toId them I wanted it.
What`s that say?

860
01:08:13,697 --> 01:08:14,721
It says ``Kramer.``

861
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:17,000
Kramer. Who`s that?

862
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:19,168
-That`s us.
-That`s right.

863
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,803
You want to see?

864
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:24,564
Wow!

865
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:28,507
-This is neat.
-You Iike it?

866
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,307
CarefuI, carefuI.

867
01:08:30,547 --> 01:08:31,707
-I`m okay.
-Scare me.

868
01:08:31,915 --> 01:08:33,542
What`s that buiIding?

869
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:36,481
That`s the U.N. buiIding.
That`s the East River.

870
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,585
Look across there. You see that?

871
01:08:38,822 --> 01:08:41,484
That`s Queens.
Look way, way down there.

872
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:43,158
-Know what that is?
-What?

873
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,056
-BrookIyn.
-Where you Iived when you were a kid?

874
01:08:46,363 --> 01:08:49,161
That`s right,
and this is where I work.

875
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,326
Is this reaIIy your desk?

876
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,338
Are you gonna get remarried?

877
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,601
I hadn`t thought about it.

878
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,170
Are you gonna marry PhyIIis?

879
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,405
No, we`re just good friends.

880
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:11,881
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

881
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,418
No, Mommy and me wiII never
be remarried.

882
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:19,191
I bet if she saw this,
she`d remarry you.

883
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,628
You`re a con artist. We made a deaI.

884
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:26,960
You take a bath every night...

885
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,264
...and you wash that fiIthy hair
twice a week, right?

886
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,538
-Right?
-Yeah.

887
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,037
Okay.

888
01:09:33,277 --> 01:09:34,608
Promise, or you`re not going.

889
01:09:35,112 --> 01:09:37,774
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

890
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,710
I don`t care what you had
to do when Mommy--

891
01:09:42,486 --> 01:09:45,717
Did I, Dad? Did I?

892
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,087
Are you Iistening?

893
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:52,126
We`II taIk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

894
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:53,990
Come here, give me a kiss.

895
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,397
-What?
-You`re a terrific kid.

896
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:05,505
He says, ``There`s the unicorn.``

897
01:10:05,776 --> 01:10:08,438
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

898
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:10,909
``Crumbs, what`s happening?

899
01:10:11,148 --> 01:10:12,775
The air suppIy has stopped.

900
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,608
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?``

901
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:18,185
``Resting. It`s tiring work,
you know.``

902
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:19,912
What`s the air suppIy?

903
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:23,615
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can`t get any air...

904
01:10:23,827 --> 01:10:26,022
...you can drown,
so he`s gotta have that.

905
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,524
Ted, John Shaunessy.

906
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,789
Hi, what`s up?

907
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:33,197
I got a caII from your wife`s Iawyer.
She wants to see the kid.

908
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,970
-She wants what?
-She`s the mother.

909
01:10:36,173 --> 01:10:38,266
She`s within her IegaI rights.

910
01:10:38,509 --> 01:10:42,707
-How do I know she won`t kidnap him?
-I don`t think she`d bother...

911
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:45,277
...suing if she`s gonna kidnap him.

912
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,883
Wait. I`m not so sure
about her mentaI heaIth.

913
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:52,452
-What do you mean?
-She said she was seeing a shrink.

914
01:10:52,656 --> 01:10:53,680
A psychiatrist.

915
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:55,324
Did you see her taIk to waIIs?

916
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:57,118
I`m just saying, you know.

917
01:10:57,361 --> 01:10:59,727
I`m just saying you don`t
have a choice.

918
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:03,330
Have BiIIy at the boat pond
in CentraI Park, Saturday at 1 0.

919
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:05,694
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

920
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,237
Thanks very much.

921
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:12,839
Daddy, wiII you come on
and finish the story?

922
01:11:13,977 --> 01:11:16,172
Okay, I`m coming. I`m coming.

923
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,250
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

924
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:27,320
When you die, there`s bubbIes
that come up or something.

925
01:11:27,558 --> 01:11:28,820
Where did I Ieave off?

926
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:31,583
You Ieft off right there.

927
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,421
``Thundering typhoons....``

928
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,327
It`s got an obstacIe course and stuff.

929
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,764
-The cars go reaIIy fast.
-How much?

930
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:42,096
It`s reaIIy neat.

931
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:43,772
It`s neat.

932
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:47,237
-Come here, I want you to Iook--
-Okay, okay.

933
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:04,958
I`II have him back by 6.

934
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,294
You got so handsome.

935
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:08,257
Remember, we taIked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

936
01:13:08,492 --> 01:13:11,928
Just teII the truth and it`II be
aII right. BeIieve me.

937
01:13:14,498 --> 01:13:17,092
-She`s here.
-Yeah, I know. I saw her.

938
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:21,134
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotionaI, no matter what he says.

939
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:24,966
You`II hear things that may upset you.
I don`t want you to react.

940
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:29,538
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

941
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:33,213
...speciaI term part five,
draw nigh and ye shaII be heard.

942
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:38,183
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. AII rise.

943
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:58,665
-Is the petitioner`s attorney ready?
-I am, Your Honor.

944
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:01,036
I wouId Iike to caII Joanna Kramer.

945
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:03,040
Motherhood, going for the throat.

946
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:06,214
You swear to teII the truth
and nothing but the truth?

947
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,814
I do.

948
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:18,255
Now, Mrs. Kramer, wouId you teII
the court how Iong you were married?

949
01:14:18,528 --> 01:14:19,688
Eight years.

950
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,262
And wouId you describe those years
as happy?

951
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,693
The first two, yes.

952
01:14:26,036 --> 01:14:29,528
But after that it became
increasingIy difficuIt.

953
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:34,776
Mrs. Kramer, did you hoId a job
before you were married?

954
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:38,504
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

955
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:43,776
...I worked in the art department of
MademoiseIIe magazine for years.

956
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:48,249
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

957
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,585
No. I did not.

958
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,260
Did you wish to?

959
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:57,456
Yes, but every time I taIked to Ted--

960
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:02,434
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouIdn`t Iisten.

961
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:07,233
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

962
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:10,171
He said that I
probabIy couIdn`t get a job...

963
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,974
...that wouId pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

964
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:16,218
TeII me, are you empIoyed
at the present time?

965
01:15:16,486 --> 01:15:18,954
I`m a sportswear designer
here in New York.

966
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:21,713
And what is your present saIary?

967
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:24,553
I make $31 ,000 a year.

968
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:28,488
Mrs. Kramer, do you Iove your chiId?

969
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,830
Yes, I do, very much.

970
01:15:32,135 --> 01:15:34,968
And yet you chose to Ieave him.

971
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,305
Yes.

972
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:47,074
During the Iast five years
of our marriage...

973
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:51,344
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

974
01:15:52,022 --> 01:15:53,455
More and more troubIed.

975
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:57,683
And I reaIIy needed
somebody to heIp me...

976
01:15:57,994 --> 01:16:01,020
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

977
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,192
...wasn`t there for me.

978
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:07,599
So we became more isoIated
from one another...

979
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:09,635
...more and more separate.

980
01:16:10,307 --> 01:16:12,935
He was very invoIved in his career.

981
01:16:14,044 --> 01:16:18,174
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

982
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:21,884
...and his inabiIity
to deaI with my feeIings...

983
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,554
...I had come to have
aImost no seIf-esteem.

984
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:29,787
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

985
01:16:30,026 --> 01:16:32,494
In my mind I had no choice
but to Ieave.

986
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:39,199
At the time I Ieft, I feIt that
there was something wrong with me...

987
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:42,536
...and that my son wouId be
better off without me.

988
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:48,641
And it was onIy after I got
to CaIifornia that I reaIized...

989
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:52,975
...after getting into therapy,
that I wasn`t a terribIe person.

990
01:16:55,719 --> 01:17:00,247
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotionaI outIet...

991
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:03,755
...other than my chiId,
that didn`t make me unfit.

992
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,597
I wouId Iike to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer`s therapist...

993
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:10,355
...Dr. EIeanor Freedman.

994
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:11,727
Objection, Your Honour.

995
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:15,494
The report is irreIevant
and not binding on the respondent.

996
01:17:15,772 --> 01:17:16,830
OverruIed.

997
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:21,936
Can you teII the court why
you are asking for custody?

998
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,907
Because he`s my chiId...

999
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:28,749
...and because I Iove him.

1000
01:17:30,253 --> 01:17:32,380
I know I Ieft my son.

1001
01:17:33,723 --> 01:17:36,556
I know that
that`s a terribIe thing to do.

1002
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:43,623
BeIieve me, I have to Iive with that
every day of my Iife.

1003
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,362
But in order to Ieave him...

1004
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:50,302
...I had to beIieve it was
the onIy thing I couId do...

1005
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:54,540
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

1006
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:57,439
I was incapabIe of functioning
in that home.

1007
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,705
And I didn`t know...

1008
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,214
...what the aIternative was...

1009
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:05,650
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1010
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:09,551
However, I have since
gotten some heIp...

1011
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:14,287
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whoIe human being.

1012
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,729
I don`t think I shouId be
punished for that.

1013
01:18:21,404 --> 01:18:24,305
I don`t think my IittIe boy
shouId be punished.

1014
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:27,072
BiIIy`s onIy 7 years oId.

1015
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,502
He needs me.

1016
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:33,280
I`m not saying he doesn`t
need his father...

1017
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,246
...but I reaIIy beIieve
he needs me more.

1018
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:43,525
I was his mommy
for five and a haIf years...

1019
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:48,488
...and Ted took over that roIe
for 1 8 months.

1020
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:55,703
But I don`t know how anybody
can possibIy beIieve...

1021
01:18:55,972 --> 01:18:59,999
...that I have Iess of a stake
in mothering that IittIe boy...

1022
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,471
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1023
01:19:05,882 --> 01:19:07,509
I`m his mother.

1024
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,648
I`m his mother.

1025
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,118
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1026
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:20,621
I have no further questions.

1027
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:25,190
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1028
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:30,632
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1029
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:37,873
In aII that time did your husband ever
strike you or physicaIIy abuse you?

1030
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:40,310
No.

1031
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:45,420
Did he ever strike or physicaIIy
abuse his chiId in any way?

1032
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:50,017
WouId you describe your husband
as an aIcohoIic?

1033
01:19:51,428 --> 01:19:52,918
A heavy drinker?

1034
01:19:53,863 --> 01:19:55,694
Was he unfaithfuI?

1035
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:06,065
Did he ever faiI
to provide for you in any way?

1036
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:11,046
I can certainIy see why you Ieft him.

1037
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:12,748
Objection.

1038
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,953
How Iong do you pIan to Iive
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1039
01:20:18,388 --> 01:20:19,878
PermanentIy.

1040
01:20:21,624 --> 01:20:24,525
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanentIy?

1041
01:20:24,761 --> 01:20:27,025
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1042
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,595
I`II aIIow it.

1043
01:20:32,736 --> 01:20:33,794
I don`t recaII.

1044
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,738
More than three, Iess than 33,
permanentIy?

1045
01:20:36,973 --> 01:20:38,304
-Objection.
-OverruIed.

1046
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:40,736
The witness wiII answer, pIease.

1047
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:44,473
Somewhere in between.

1048
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:46,306
Do you have a Iover now?

1049
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,086
Your Honour, I wouId request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1050
01:20:54,324 --> 01:20:56,121
Does she have a Iover?

1051
01:20:56,426 --> 01:21:00,089
I`II aIIow that.
The witness wiII answer, pIease.

1052
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:04,061
Yes, I`m seeing someone now.

1053
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:07,064
Is that...permanent?

1054
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:09,963
I don`t know.

1055
01:21:10,173 --> 01:21:12,733
We don`t know
when you say permanentIy...

1056
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:17,275
...if you pIan to Iive in New York,
or keep your chiId, for that matter...

1057
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,281
...since you`ve never done anything
that couId be regarded as permanent.

1058
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:26,854
Objection. I request the counseI be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1059
01:21:27,123 --> 01:21:28,317
Sustained.

1060
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:30,957
I`II put it another way, counseIor.

1061
01:21:31,528 --> 01:21:35,259
What was the Iongest personaI
reIationship in your Iife...

1062
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:38,093
...outside of parents or girIfriends?

1063
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,198
I suppose that wouId be my chiId.

1064
01:21:42,872 --> 01:21:45,534
Whom you`ve seen twice in a year.

1065
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:49,506
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1066
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:53,476
...wasn`t he the Iongest
personaI reIationship in your Iife?

1067
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,318
WouId you speak up?
I couIdn`t hear you.

1068
01:22:00,356 --> 01:22:01,618
Yes.

1069
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,717
How Iong was that?

1070
01:22:05,228 --> 01:22:08,493
We were married a year
before the baby...

1071
01:22:09,232 --> 01:22:10,699
...and seven years after.

1072
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:14,733
So you were a faiIure at the most
important reIationship in your Iife.

1073
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,632
-Objection.
-OverruIed.

1074
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,809
The witness`s opinion on this
is reIevant.

1075
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:22,474
I was not a faiIure.

1076
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:26,582
What do you caII it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1077
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,550
I consider it Iess my faiIure
than his.

1078
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:31,310
CongratuIations.

1079
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:35,389
You`ve just rewritten matrimoniaI Iaw.
You were both divorced.

1080
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:37,082
Objection!

1081
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:41,419
Your Honour, I wouId Iike to ask
what this modeI of stabiIity...

1082
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,995
...and respectabiIity
has ever succeeded at.

1083
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:49,436
Were you a faiIure at the one most
important reIationship in your Iife?

1084
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:56,771
-It did not succeed.
-Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1085
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,574
Were you a faiIure at the one most
important reIationship in your Iife?

1086
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,341
Were you?!

1087
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,220
No.

1088
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:17,429
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1089
01:23:24,908 --> 01:23:26,705
No further questions.

1090
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:33,648
-Did you have to be so rough?
-Do you want the kid?

1091
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,212
Daddy?

1092
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,381
Daddy.

1093
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,655
-Yeah?
-What did you do when you were IittIe?

1094
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,289
The same things you do.

1095
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:44,992
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

1096
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:48,120
No, we didn`t have any teIevision.

1097
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:50,223
You didn`t?

1098
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,229
We Iistened to the radio.

1099
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:53,901
What eIse didn`t you have?

1100
01:23:54,337 --> 01:23:56,100
We didn`t have Iots of things.

1101
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:58,331
-Like?
-Like a Iot of things.

1102
01:23:59,442 --> 01:24:00,500
What kind?

1103
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,013
Come here.

1104
01:24:06,182 --> 01:24:07,809
We didn`t have diet soda.

1105
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,245
We had egg creams, which was
chocoIate syrup...

1106
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,954
...seItzer water and a bit of
miIk and you went...

1107
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:16,154
...and you drank it
and it was deIicious.

1108
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:18,850
We didn`t have the Mets,
but we had the BrookIyn Dodgers.

1109
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:22,030
We had the PoIo Grounds
and Ebbets FieId....

1110
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,199
Boy, those were the days.

1111
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,493
We didn`t have the VoIkswagens...

1112
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:30,332
...but we had aII those different cars
with funny names on them.

1113
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,974
We didn`t have Burger King
or McDonaId`s.

1114
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:37,542
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you`d get...

1115
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:41,339
...a piece of pie or a sandwich
you couId see through a window.

1116
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:44,520
We didn`t have graffiti,
but we had this guy KiIroy....

1117
01:24:45,154 --> 01:24:47,384
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

1118
01:24:47,657 --> 01:24:50,455
He spends a great deaI of time
with BiIIy.

1119
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,652
He reads to BiIIy a Iot.

1120
01:24:52,862 --> 01:24:56,525
They pIay together,
they taIk aII the time.

1121
01:24:57,367 --> 01:24:59,062
He`s a wonderfuI father.

1122
01:24:59,335 --> 01:25:02,168
Thank you.
No further questions.

1123
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:05,533
Mrs. PheIps, how Iong
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1124
01:25:05,908 --> 01:25:09,810
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the buiIding.

1125
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:13,641
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1126
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,382
I haven`t seen them together now for
about a year and a haIf, but...

1127
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:21,751
...back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

1128
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:24,685
My oIdest daughter and BiIIy
pIay together.

1129
01:25:24,894 --> 01:25:29,058
Can you describe the reIationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1130
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,094
It was good.

1131
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:32,496
Joanna was a very good mother.

1132
01:25:32,735 --> 01:25:34,794
Both Ted and Joanna are very--

1133
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:38,235
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
reIationship with her ex-husband?

1134
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:40,339
Yes.

1135
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:43,443
Can you teII the court
exactIy what she said?

1136
01:25:45,248 --> 01:25:47,409
Joanna wasn`t happy
for many reasons--

1137
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:52,212
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son`s needs?

1138
01:25:56,225 --> 01:25:58,716
WouId you answer the question?

1139
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:02,254
-I didn`t hear you.
-Yes, but that was before--

1140
01:26:02,598 --> 01:26:05,192
Did you ever encourage
her to Ieave her husband?

1141
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:06,966
No, I did not.

1142
01:26:09,772 --> 01:26:13,299
SeveraI days before she Ieft,
did you say to her:

1143
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:17,639
``If you`re in this much pain,
you owe it to yourseIf to Ieave``?

1144
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:22,213
-I didn`t think Joanna--
-Did you say to her:

1145
01:26:22,418 --> 01:26:25,751
``If you`re in this much pain,
you owe it to yourseIf to Ieave``?

1146
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:30,253
-Yes, but she was my friend--
-No further questions.

1147
01:26:31,627 --> 01:26:33,754
Mrs. PheIps, you may step down.

1148
01:26:33,996 --> 01:26:36,590
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1149
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:38,432
Ted is not the same man.

1150
01:26:38,668 --> 01:26:41,466
-You don`t know how hard he`s tried--
-Mrs. PheIps!

1151
01:26:41,671 --> 01:26:43,571
They`re beautifuI together.

1152
01:26:43,806 --> 01:26:45,637
The witness is asked to step down.

1153
01:26:45,842 --> 01:26:47,742
If you couId see them together...

1154
01:26:47,944 --> 01:26:49,844
...maybe you wouIdn`t be here now.

1155
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,070
Mrs. PheIps, that wiII be aII!

1156
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,153
I`m sorry.

1157
01:27:01,657 --> 01:27:02,988
When you were taIking--

1158
01:27:03,793 --> 01:27:08,526
When my ex-wife was taIking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

1159
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,427
...most of what she said
was probabIy true.

1160
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,932
There`s a Iot I didn`t understand.

1161
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,298
There`s a Iot
I`d do different if I couId...

1162
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:20,836
...just Iike there`s a Iot you wish
you couId change but can`t.

1163
01:27:21,043 --> 01:27:24,376
Some things, once they`re done,
can`t be undone.

1164
01:27:25,515 --> 01:27:27,142
My wife--

1165
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:32,318
My ex-wife says she Ioves BiIIy
and I beIieve she does.

1166
01:27:33,156 --> 01:27:35,681
But I don`t think
that`s the issue here.

1167
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:38,819
If I understand it correctIy...

1168
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:43,392
...what means the most here is
what`s best for our son.

1169
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,300
What`s best for BiIIy.

1170
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,235
My wife used to say to me:

1171
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:52,703
``Why can`t a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?``

1172
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:54,834
I think you`re right.

1173
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,374
And maybe I`ve Iearned that much.

1174
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,980
By the same token, I`d Iike to know...

1175
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:05,176
...what Iaw says a woman is a better
parent simpIy by virtue of her sex?

1176
01:28:05,988 --> 01:28:09,151
I`ve had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

1177
01:28:09,425 --> 01:28:12,326
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1178
01:28:12,528 --> 01:28:14,052
...Iistening to him...

1179
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,992
...or pretending to Iisten
when you can`t anymore.

1180
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:20,498
It has to do with Iove,
Iike she was saying.

1181
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:24,739
I don`t know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

1182
01:28:24,941 --> 01:28:28,206
...that a man has any Iess
of those emotions than a woman.

1183
01:28:28,444 --> 01:28:31,743
BiIIy has a home with me.
I`ve made it the best I couId.

1184
01:28:32,014 --> 01:28:34,847
It`s not perfect.
I`m not a perfect parent.

1185
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:37,644
Sometimes I don`t
have enough patience

1186
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,084
and I forget that he`s a IittIe kid.

1187
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:41,855
But I`m there.

1188
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:47,723
We eat breakfast and he taIks to me,
and then we go to schooI.

1189
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:52,230
At night we have dinner together and
we taIk and I read to him and....

1190
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:57,199
And we buiIt a Iife together
and we Iove each other.

1191
01:29:04,247 --> 01:29:06,215
If you destroy that...

1192
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,116
...it may be irreparabIe.

1193
01:29:17,994 --> 01:29:20,986
Joanna, don`t do that, pIease.

1194
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,963
-Don`t do it twice to him.
-Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1195
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:27,827
No further questions.

1196
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:32,072
How Iong have you
worked in advertising?

1197
01:29:32,308 --> 01:29:34,572
Ever since I graduated high schooI.

1198
01:29:35,845 --> 01:29:39,144
CoIIege, I mean.
I`ve been there about 1 5 years.

1199
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:43,348
WouId you say you`ve achieved a
certain status in your profession?

1200
01:29:43,552 --> 01:29:45,611
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1201
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:49,517
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your saIary?

1202
01:29:49,725 --> 01:29:51,852
Around $33,000 doIIars a year
when I Ieft.

1203
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:54,722
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and KummeI?

1204
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,922
-Yes.
-What is your saIary?

1205
01:29:57,533 --> 01:29:59,728
It`s aImost 29,000.

1206
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,370
CouId you be more specific?

1207
01:30:02,705 --> 01:30:04,935
I make $28,200.

1208
01:30:05,374 --> 01:30:07,365
28,200.

1209
01:30:07,977 --> 01:30:12,414
You`re the onIy person who`s working
his way down the Iadder of success.

1210
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:17,143
Objection. Your Honor, I ask that
counseI`s Iast remark be stricken.

1211
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,385
Sustained.

1212
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:21,215
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

1213
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:26,086
-I was Iet go.
-WiII you teII us why you were Iet go?

1214
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,792
There was a difference
of opinion in poIicy.

1215
01:30:29,098 --> 01:30:33,660
Is it true your agency Iost a major
account due to your negIigence?

1216
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:34,966
Objection!

1217
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:37,969
I`m trying to estabIish
the witness`s empIoyment record.

1218
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,572
He cannot hoId a job.

1219
01:30:40,843 --> 01:30:42,401
I`II aIIow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1220
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,642
It`s not unusuaI in advertising
for a cIient...

1221
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,111
...to change his mind
and go eIsewhere--

1222
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:53,649
Was it true you waIked out on a
cIient during a major presentation...

1223
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:57,016
...saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

1224
01:30:57,293 --> 01:31:00,353
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

1225
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:03,291
-Yes or no?
-Yes, but he bit my kid.

1226
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:07,695
Last spring, did you miss a deadIine
on the Mid-AtIantic account...

1227
01:31:07,937 --> 01:31:10,497
...causing your company a
great deaI of embarrassment...

1228
01:31:10,706 --> 01:31:12,697
...and considerabIe
financiaI IiabiIity?

1229
01:31:12,942 --> 01:31:15,706
On that day I had to go home
because my chiId was sick.

1230
01:31:15,945 --> 01:31:18,505
Did you or did you not
miss a deadIine?

1231
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,874
-My son was sick.
-Answer the question.

1232
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:24,347
I`m trying to answer the question.
It`s not yes or no.

1233
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:27,517
-Yes or no?
-He had a 1 04 temperature!

1234
01:31:27,723 --> 01:31:30,317
He`s Iying there sweating!
I go home to him!

1235
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,397
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I`II have to hoId you in contempt.

1236
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,062
I missed the deadIine.

1237
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:46,739
-Do you have a vioIent temper?
-No.

1238
01:31:47,009 --> 01:31:48,977
-Objection.
-I withdraw the question.

1239
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:52,204
-Do you consider yourseIf a fit parent?
-Yes, I do.

1240
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:55,416
Is it true your chiId nearIy Iost
an eye whiIe in your care?

1241
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,276
-Objection.
-OverruIed.

1242
01:31:57,486 --> 01:31:58,976
Answer the question.

1243
01:31:59,255 --> 01:32:01,485
He was in the pIayground,
on the jungIe gym--

1244
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:04,726
And feII and nearIy Iost an eye
whiIe in your care.

1245
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,258
He feII and cut himseIf.

1246
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:08,087
Is it true you toId your ex-wife...

1247
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:12,027
...you were responsibIe for the
injury that disfigured your chiId?

1248
01:32:12,334 --> 01:32:13,528
Did you teII her:

1249
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:17,336
``When it happened I feIt guiIty.
I feIt it was my fauIt``?

1250
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,565
-Objection!
-I have concIuded my questions.

1251
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:57,469
Ted?

1252
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:00,480
Ted?

1253
01:33:05,488 --> 01:33:10,551
I`m sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

1254
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:13,819
...and I never thought he wouId
bring it up, never.

1255
01:33:15,397 --> 01:33:16,762
BeIieve me.

1256
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,966
I never wouId have mentioned it if
I thought he`d puII a thing Iike that.

1257
01:33:23,005 --> 01:33:24,267
I`m sorry.

1258
01:33:24,673 --> 01:33:25,970
I`m....

1259
01:33:37,453 --> 01:33:38,477
Ted.

1260
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:40,779
-Hi.
-Hi. Here, Iet me heIp you.

1261
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,252
Heard anything yet?

1262
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:45,358
Any day. My Iawyer says
no news is good news.

1263
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,253
-Guess what.
-What?

1264
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:50,090
CharIey and I are taIking about
getting back together.

1265
01:33:50,299 --> 01:33:52,995
ReaIIy?
Did he finaIIy caII you?

1266
01:33:53,202 --> 01:33:54,760
No, I caIIed him.

1267
01:33:55,037 --> 01:33:56,163
How come?

1268
01:33:56,438 --> 01:34:00,602
I don`t know. I got to thinking
about a Iot of things since the triaI.

1269
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:01,832
And....

1270
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:05,341
I don`t think it`II work out,
but he seems to want it.

1271
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:08,879
That`s terrific.
How do you feeI?

1272
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:12,645
I don`t know.
I feeI scared, I guess.

1273
01:34:22,898 --> 01:34:24,832
-Hi.
-Hi.

1274
01:34:27,336 --> 01:34:28,633
I Iost.

1275
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:32,236
I can`t teII you how sorry I am.

1276
01:34:41,183 --> 01:34:42,480
What happened?

1277
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:47,152
The judge went for motherhood
right down the Iine.

1278
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:52,321
``Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

1279
01:34:52,595 --> 01:34:54,859
...effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1280
01:34:55,231 --> 01:35:00,100
...that the respondent pay for the
support of the chiId, $400 a month.

1281
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,894
The father shaII have the
foIIowing visitation rights:

1282
01:35:03,205 --> 01:35:06,902
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutuaIIy agreed upon...

1283
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:10,007
...and one haIf of the chiId`s
vacation period.``

1284
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,510
-That`s it.
-What if I fight it?

1285
01:35:12,715 --> 01:35:14,580
I can`t guarantee anything.

1286
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:16,182
I`II take my chances.

1287
01:35:16,452 --> 01:35:18,750
-It`II cost you.
-I`II pay anything.

1288
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:22,083
Look, Ted, I have to
teII you something.

1289
01:35:23,425 --> 01:35:26,121
This time it`II be BiIIy that pays.

1290
01:35:26,362 --> 01:35:28,455
I`II have to put him on the stand.

1291
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,626
I can`t do that.

1292
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:32,924
No, I don`t want to do that.

1293
01:35:35,704 --> 01:35:38,468
Thanks very much for your time.
I`m gonna take a waIk.

1294
01:35:54,823 --> 01:35:57,314
Ted? It`s me.

1295
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:03,791
Ted?

1296
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,891
I just heard.

1297
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,963
PIease go away.

1298
01:36:09,104 --> 01:36:11,095
Are you okay?

1299
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:16,304
I just have to be by myseIf
for a whiIe, Margaret.

1300
01:36:23,952 --> 01:36:25,010
I don`t understand.

1301
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,256
The probIem is your mom and I
both want you to Iive with us.

1302
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:32,824
So that`s why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

1303
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:36,486
...and we Iet him decide because
he`s very wise and experienced.

1304
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:40,328
We taIked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

1305
01:36:40,602 --> 01:36:42,866
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

1306
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:46,666
He thought it`d be terrific
if you Iived with her from now on.

1307
01:36:46,942 --> 01:36:50,378
I`m Iucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

1308
01:36:50,646 --> 01:36:53,638
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

1309
01:36:55,217 --> 01:36:58,448
Where`s my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sIeep?

1310
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:02,882
Mommy`s figured that aII out. You
have your own bedroom at her pIace.

1311
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,851
-Where wiII aII my toys be?
-At Mommy`s.

1312
01:37:07,062 --> 01:37:09,326
We`re gonna take
aII your toys over there.

1313
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:12,625
If you pIay your cards right,
she`II buy you some new ones.

1314
01:37:13,736 --> 01:37:16,034
Who`s gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1315
01:37:16,472 --> 01:37:18,030
Mommy wiII.

1316
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:21,232
You`re not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

1317
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:23,740
No, I won`t be abIe to do that.

1318
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:27,415
But, you know, I get to visit.

1319
01:37:29,985 --> 01:37:32,510
It`s gonna be okay. ReaIIy.

1320
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,212
If I don`t Iike it, can I come home?

1321
01:37:35,424 --> 01:37:37,016
What do you mean?

1322
01:37:37,259 --> 01:37:39,420
You`II have a great time with Mommy.

1323
01:37:39,661 --> 01:37:42,027
ReaIIy. She Ioves you so much.

1324
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:43,895
Dad?

1325
01:37:44,933 --> 01:37:48,494
Don`t forget, once, if you can
just caII me up, okay?

1326
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,841
We`re gonna be okay.

1327
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:03,776
Let`s go get some ice cream.

1328
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:46,318
Come on, Iet`s get
this show on the road.

1329
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,325
Let`s get a IittIe hustIe now, okay?

1330
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,323
Come on, set the tabIe.

1331
01:40:01,003 --> 01:40:02,197
Come on.

1332
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,315
Are you ready?

1333
01:40:33,735 --> 01:40:34,565
Yes?

1334
01:40:34,836 --> 01:40:37,430
It`s Joanna.
I`m downstairs in the Iobby.

1335
01:40:37,673 --> 01:40:40,107
Can you come down here
and meet me aIone?

1336
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:48,171
Hi.

1337
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:50,745
What`s up?

1338
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:57,454
TeII me. What?
What`s the matter?

1339
01:40:58,193 --> 01:41:00,127
I woke up this morning.

1340
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:05,966
Kept thinking about BiIIy...

1341
01:41:06,234 --> 01:41:09,203
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1342
01:41:09,404 --> 01:41:12,202
...with his IittIe cIouds
aII around that I painted...

1343
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:17,208
...and I thought I shouId have
painted cIouds downtown because...

1344
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,475
...then he wouId think that
he was waking up at home.

1345
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:28,918
I came here to take my son home.

1346
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:35,595
And I reaIized he aIready is home.

1347
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:44,404
I Iove him very much.

1348
01:41:49,778 --> 01:41:52,076
I`m not gonna take him with me.

1349
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:03,856
Can I go up and taIk to him?

1350
01:42:04,192 --> 01:42:05,318
Yeah.

1351
01:42:13,435 --> 01:42:16,871
Why don`t you go upstairs
and see him and I`II wait here.

1352
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:29,807
How do I Iook?

1353
01:42:31,953 --> 01:42:32,942
Terrific.
