1
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:18,057
- 950 grams. Nice and juicy. - That's a shoulder piece, isn't it¡H

2
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:22,805
The Kube brothers get what they always get. Tell me about it¡I

3
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:26,428
- How much do we owe you¡H - Two sacks.

4
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:40,135
Oh, it's Mr Interligator. How's the wife¡H

5
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,424
She's doing poorly.

6
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:47,131
- Roger, your shawl. - But I've got my shawl.

7
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,347
So she tried to commit suicide again¡H

8
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:58,473
By some miracle, she's alive.

9
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:02,380
Butcher, I think...

10
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,515
- you're getting a customer. - Who's next¡H

11
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,266
I am.

12
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,513
- That for me¡H - At your service.

13
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,845
Put it on my bill.

14
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,891
We all know where she keeps her bill.

15
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,172
OK, you're next.

16
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:34,346
That damn carburettor. This has happened before.

17
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:47,178
That'll cost you... Iet's see... the ride plus the luggage...

18
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:49,348
How are you paying¡H

19
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:57,882
- In lentils¡H - That's all I have left.

20
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:03,514
Listen, I'd settle for those shoes.

21
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:13,513
- We're closed for the day. - I didn't come about that.

22
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:16,345
I don't eat meat anyway.

23
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,882
- I came about the ad. - What ad¡H

24
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:21,720
- The ad in the paper. - What paper¡H

25
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,724
Hard Times.

26
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,725
Hold on...

27
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:34,305
"Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs. Room and board."

28
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,846
"Room facing south."

29
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,555
I do have the right address, don't I¡H Number 129a¡H

30
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,469
Whether here or there, this is nowhere.

31
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:46,967
That way we don't get hassled by the neighbours.

32
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,431
Nor by any visitors.

33
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,926
Well...

34
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:57,383
I must have made a mistake.

35
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:21,010
Not so fast. You're looking for a job, right¡H

36
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:22,768
Come over here.

37
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:26,010
- Turn around. - Pardon me¡H

38
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,513
Turn around.

39
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,764
How much do you weigh¡H

40
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,011
63 or 64 kilos. Why¡H

41
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:38,268
You're not exactly hefty. The job I've got takes muscle.

42
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,391
- Don't worry about that. - I'm a butcher.

43
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:47,432
I'm straight with people. So I'd say you haven't got what it takes.

44
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:52,183
You don't have the body structure, the right breadth.

45
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,847
Nonetheless I'll give you a try.

46
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:58,390
But you'll have to bust your ass.

47
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,973
I'd call that a stroke of luck.

48
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,217
- Thanks. - Come on, let's go.

49
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:07,185
So what exactly does the job entail¡H

50
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:14,055
Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs. Room and board. Room facing south.

51
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,393
- Just like in the ad¡H - What do you know¡H Like in the ad.

52
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:26,432
Hey, watch it. One of the steps is loose. You'll have to fix that.

53
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:33,009
And do all the painting, cleaning, the electricity. The whole shebang.

54
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:41,307
You'll like it here, you'll see.

55
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,304
And there aren't any neighbours opposite. The key is on this nail.

56
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,187
Well, I'll let you get settled in.

57
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:55,769
Thanks.

58
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:24,514
- How are things in town¡H - Terrible. Really terrible.

59
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:29,102
It's the rationing. They'd eat their shoes. Kind of touch and go.

60
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:34,348
- They haven't got any street smarts. - It's a mess. Till things grow back.

61
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:37,229
Nothing will ever grow back. Ever.

62
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:43,551
- You're quite the optimist. - Get that through your thick skull.

63
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,685
- Well, is your hair growing back¡H - No.

64
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,219
You see¡H It's the same thing.

65
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,353
Couldn't we open that window for five minutes¡H

66
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:13,305
I like the smell of glue. It smells like fish. It brings back memories.

67
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,473
What do you think of the new guy¡H

68
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:28,099
Are you deaf or something¡H

69
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,229
He's skinny.

70
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,767
Still thinking of her, huh¡H

71
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:44,769
Apparently she's hearing voices now.

72
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:12,893
Would it be too much of an effort to put that a bit closer¡H

73
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:47,815
Hello.

74
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:46,314
Ma'am...

75
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:51,727
She's deaf as a post. This way we always know where she is.

76
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:57,692
Granny, go back upstairs to your room. There's nothing left. Now go.

77
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:07,064
You finished¡H Then don't hang around. Fix the bulb on the 2nd floor.

78
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,600
- Hi, butcher. - Hi, postman.

79
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:23,853
- Got a parcel for your daughter. - Upstairs.

80
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,765
- Watch the step. - Mind your business.

81
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,230
Grab it, Marcel.

82
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,309
- I've got it. - Throw it over here. Throw it.

83
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,768
You shit.

84
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:06,561
Postal Administration. Article 12.

85
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:11,151
You've got exactly 20 seconds to get back to your flats.

86
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:14,976
- Move. - You don't have kids to feed.

87
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,809
That applies to kids as well.

88
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,019
Can't you read, moron¡H

89
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:40,021
- "Julie Clapet." - He's a friend.

90
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:43,069
A friend¡H

91
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:47,271
Here, Julie.

92
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,693
Sign here, Julie.

93
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:56,360
I call you Julie because I like you. But I don't want to rush you.

94
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,483
See you, Julie.

95
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:14,979
- Here. For the ad. - Always at your service.

96
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:19,569
- That new guy is kind of weird. - He used to be a circus man.

97
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:30,191
I'm sure this contains some tidbits to eat. That's why they're...

98
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:38,810
- Would you like to taste them¡H - Yes. I'd love to.

99
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,189
Shall we say at 7¡H That'll give me time to get things ready.

100
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:53,395
- Is he after her¡H - After who¡H

101
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:57,986
Your daughter. She's a cute slip of a thing. She needs someone.

102
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:02,237
- That someone is me. Is that clear¡H - Hey, I've got news.

103
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,392
They shot one down two days ago. A superb 30-metre target.

104
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:09,102
- No bodies¡H - They cart them away.

105
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:12,936
Bloody vermin. They even say they eat money.

106
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:18,653
We've got to get rid of them for good, those vegetable-eating queers.

107
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,647
They'll get what's coming to them.

108
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,569
THE ENEMY PLOTS AGAINST US

109
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,400
- Bye, butcher. - Bye, postman.

110
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:39,315
- Do you think that's it for tonight¡H - I hope so.

111
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:44,482
That goddamn butcher, I'm sure he won't do it tonight.

112
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:48,653
He's taking his time just to make me mad.

113
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:53,107
- He's obviously succeeded. - What's he waiting for anyway¡H

114
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:57,019
Till the new guy tries to escape in a garbage can, too¡H

115
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:03,318
- How long did the other guy last us¡H - A week.

116
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:10,395
Not counting the broth, that is.

117
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:27,189
One week. We polished off the last chunk two days ago.

118
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:34,734
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.

119
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:37,068
I'm fucking starving.

120
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:45,816
My little Hercule... Every man for himself, and God for all.

121
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:33,735
- Hi there. It's me. - Hello.

122
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,325
Come in.

123
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:41,242
Please, do come in.

124
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:46,074
- For you. - Thank you.

125
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:47,907
Sit down.

126
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:58,316
- Did you paint that¡H - Yes, it's nothing much.

127
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:03,731
- No, no... - No problem.

128
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,074
I've made a pot of tea.

129
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:19,780
- Shall I pour you a cup¡H - Yes, please.

130
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:29,357
- I hope you don't find me too bold. - Oh, no. Not at all.

131
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:32,823
- Why should I¡H - A girl invites you to her flat.

132
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:36,613
Some would consider that a bit brazen.

133
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:41,034
- Well, actually... - And thank you for this morning.

134
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:47,074
- Why thank you¡H - You rescued my parcel on the steps.

135
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:50,615
I was very moved by your concern.

136
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,357
That goes without saying.

137
00:26:56,368 --> 00:27:02,566
No, on the contrary. People usually only think of themselves nowadays.

138
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:20,404
Only because they have nothing. Deep down, they're still good people.

139
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:25,276
I'm glad to hear they like me. They're very kind.

140
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:32,816
I'm getting along with your father, too. He thinks I'm a nice guy, right¡H

141
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:37,365
- Why not try Kraft cheese spread¡H - That's new.

142
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:40,907
- And handy. - They talk to me about you.

143
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,908
- Who¡H - The voices in my head.

144
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,192
Oh, right. The voices. And what do they say¡H

145
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:56,696
Hold on, let me try to remember...

146
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:03,274
- It's more the language they use. - Do they talk about love¡H

147
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:05,035
Oh, no.

148
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:10,986
"Robert's a pervert, an arse wipe, a panty eater." You see¡H

149
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,861
But that's not true.

150
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:18,817
Aurore, you're missing something really funny.

151
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:22,865
At any rate, I have no choice. Here. Tomorrow at 11 sharp.

152
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,941
- Ring me. I'm counting on you. - But...

153
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,737
"Arse wipe"¡H

154
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:35,610
Move out¡H What for¡H I've just moved in.

155
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:40,117
Because it's pretty awful here. The building is unsanitary.

156
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:42,947
The walls are falling apart, and it leaks.

157
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:46,821
- Perhaps you don't like me¡H - Me¡H

158
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:52,073
- You act as if you want me to leave. - No, on the contrary. Not at all...

159
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,448
It does that once in a while.

160
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,571
Did I hurt you¡H

161
00:29:12,662 --> 00:29:16,442
- I'll be all right. - Then it must be the shock.

162
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:19,613
I'm such a klutz.

163
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,369
Don't move.

164
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:42,486
I'm blind as a bat. Everything's all foggy.

165
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,650
I could get lost in that fog.

166
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:01,115
Leave it. I buy two of everything because I break things.

167
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,746
- So you play the cello¡H - Yes.

168
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:15,621
I play an instrument as well.

169
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:18,869
Will you wait for me¡H

170
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:26,611
- Oh, shit. Not again. - What are you doing¡H

171
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,234
- I wanted to draw a bath. - Again¡H

172
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:33,116
Well, you sharpen your knives often enough, too.

173
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,741
A musical saw...

174
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:45,202
- It has a nice sound. - Sit down.

175
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,862
- The doctor and I had an act once. - Doctor¡H

176
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,991
Livingstone. "Dr Livingstone".

177
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,030
He was my partner.

178
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,452
- But now he's gone. - Where did he go¡H

179
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,071
He disappeared after a show. We only found his remains.

180
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:10,486
They'd eaten him.

181
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:14,367
Can you imagine that¡H They ate him.

182
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:21,194
I lost everything that night. So, the first ad I ran across...

183
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:25,953
- And here I am. - I need to tell you something.

184
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:28,947
Listen.

185
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:44,574
Do you know that tune¡H

186
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,827
It was his favourite.

187
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:40,991
Have you noticed how clear the nights have been¡H

188
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:45,414
That's normal. We're entering the Virgo age. That's my sign.

189
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:50,195
- No kidding¡H - I swear it. My ascendant is Leo.

190
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:56,872
Cut it out. Not everyone's Gorilla, ascendant Bulldozer.

191
00:32:57,082 --> 00:33:02,581
I'm in luck, there's more in store. "Get ready, the wind's shifting."

192
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:05,575
You'd like to pack up and leave, right¡H

193
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:10,329
You wouldn't get far. It's worse out there, they draw straws.

194
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:16,039
And it'd be a shame to lose these juicy hams. These little sucklings...

195
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:19,791
Stop joking around. I don't like it.

196
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:26,615
You're better off here. At least we have a system.

197
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:31,039
My ass¡I Your helpers are drawing straws, too. What about that ad¡H

198
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:32,790
That's fate.

199
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,492
You can't change fate.

200
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:49,573
It's like you said: the wind is shifting.

201
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,656
Everyone's going to get it.

202
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:24,407
Mr Louison, I shouldn't tell you this, but ..

203
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:30,326
What happened to your friend... the same thing goes on here.

204
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:34,072
It takes place at night in the stairwell.

205
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,862
That's why no one ever goes out.

206
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,454
And my father...

207
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,700
SOPORIFIC HERBAL TEA

208
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:57,450
Hi. I'm here to fix the box springs.

209
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,577
Come in.

210
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:10,917
This is an antique. It's seen a lot of use.

211
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:13,498
- Yes. - What seems to be the problem¡H

212
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,200
It squeaks. I find it bothersome.

213
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:22,915
Could you bounce around on it a bit¡H Just so I can hear¡H

214
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:34,250
- I can't see what's wrong. - It squeaks most when there are two.

215
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,162
Let's give it a try.

216
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:49,993
Just as I thought, it's the 2nd spring to the right.

217
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,543
Come, Aurore...

218
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:04,577
We are here, Aurore...

219
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:09,335
to help you.

220
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:15,460
Come...

221
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,953
Freed from life...

222
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:24,327
come with us, Aurore.

223
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:27,912
Tranquil and at peace...

224
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:34,376
Aurore, come...

225
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:37,701
COME AT 11 SHARP. RING HARD.

226
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,921
Rotten world ...

227
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,123
That should do it.

228
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,329
- Here. - Thanks.

229
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:57,047
- What are "Troglodists"¡H - Outlaws.

230
00:41:57,257 --> 00:42:02,044
- But no one ever sees them. - Just tales to distract the people.

231
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:06,085
- A typical Capricorn attitude. - Wrong. I'm Aquarius.

232
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:08,170
- Oh¡H - A sign of the future.

233
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:10,952
Oh, the future...

234
00:42:11,174 --> 00:42:14,088
It soon becomes history around here.

235
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,995
- It's very easy to miss a step. - Don't worry about me.

236
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:21,167
You brats, give that back this instant.

237
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:24,912
Remi, stop sniggering or I'll give you a whacking.

238
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:30,085
I'll beat the one with the other, do you hear¡H Give that back.

239
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,748
Oh, great¡I How will we get that back now, you guttersnipes¡H

240
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:39,082
This is a job for the Australian.

241
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:40,839
The Australian¡H

242
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,048
The Australian.

243
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,377
Stand back.

244
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:02,922
That's quite a tool.

245
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:07,294
The Australian is nothing without its master.

246
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:08,916
Wow, did you see that¡H

247
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:14,623
- Tapioca, did you find a job yet¡H - No. Nothing yet.

248
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:19,581
Bad news. You're running up quite a bill. Not to mention the rent.

249
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:24,705
I'm in a fix at the moment. But I've got something here. Want a look¡H

250
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:28,255
Black market¡H In these times¡H You make me sick.

251
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:30,622
Just take a look.

252
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:36,165
A rat-call. The female cry. It attract males.

253
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:39,464
So¡H There aren't any rats left. What's that¡H

254
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:44,249
- This¡H A bullshit detector. - Oh, yeah¡H

255
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,748
- Come on, give it a try. - Give what a try¡H

256
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:51,296
Start bullshitting. Come on.

257
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:54,257
- Come on... - I can't do it on command.

258
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,421
Life is wonderful.

259
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:02,207
Your bullshit detector is shit. Turn that thing off. It's too loud.

260
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:08,920
If you don't settle your bill soon, you'll find yourself on my hook.

261
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:13,707
Very funny. What about that clown¡H Isn't that taking a tad too long¡H

262
00:44:13,925 --> 00:44:18,795
- Everyone in the building is edgy. - Not before he's redone the ceiling.

263
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:24,922
And in the meantime, to hell with us, right¡H I've got mouths to feed.

264
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:30,502
- Yeah, the granny's, for instance. - For instance... Why bring her up¡H

265
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:34,545
- I've got my reasons. - What do you mean by that¡H

266
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,959
Want to pay up¡H Give me the granny tonight.

267
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,924
She's one of us. It's against the rules.

268
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:44,997
The rules, the rules... The age limit is a rule, too.

269
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:48,962
- She's only good for pate. - She's my mother-in-law.

270
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:53,797
- Why not take Mrs Interligator¡H - Stop yelling.

271
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,461
- It'd be an act of charity. - Please.

272
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:02,500
Interligator is fond of his wife. He's a good tenant. He pays.

273
00:45:02,718 --> 00:45:05,466
The bloody rich. They always manage.

274
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:09,539
You haven't got much choice in view of your debts.

275
00:45:33,593 --> 00:45:36,840
Oh, it's you, Julie.

276
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:40,582
- You gave me a fright. - Counting your money again¡H

277
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:44,049
Well, yes. Tell me...

278
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:49,082
You don't come to see me very often. It's nice of you to come.

279
00:45:49,301 --> 00:45:54,919
- Well, did you like your gift¡H - It must have cost you a bundle.

280
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:58,964
Well, yes. Anything to make you happy.

281
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:03,750
- You've loved sweets since you... - But I don't any more.

282
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:17,676
- Let him go. - You always ask the same thing.

283
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:21,796
- It's the same old story every time. - No, this time...

284
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:26,668
This time it's different¡H True. Just look at you. I know what he's up to.

285
00:46:26,886 --> 00:46:31,128
With his puppy eyes. Making your head spin with his dreams...

286
00:46:31,344 --> 00:46:33,963
- There's no room for dreams. - Stop that.

287
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:38,336
It's a tough world out there. I didn't make the world.

288
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:43,884
I know you hate my trade, but it's an art like any other.

289
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:49,249
- Let him leave this place. - With you¡H You won't last two weeks.

290
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:53,712
- I don't want to lose you. - You lost me long ago.

291
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:55,468
Julie...

292
00:47:30,428 --> 00:47:34,291
TROGLODISM: AN UNDERGROUND ORGANISATION¡H

293
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:51,883
Good evening, old girl. Guess what¡H Let's play a little game, OK¡H

294
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:55,094
I'll scare you, and you'll scream.

295
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:59,002
That little clown upstairs will rush to your rescue.

296
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,928
Let's begin, OK¡H

297
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:16,510
Go for it¡I Planning to take my picture or what¡H

298
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:19,389
Scream, goddamn it.

299
00:52:43,807 --> 00:52:48,511
You came from the N.E. sector to annoy us with your beau's troubles¡H

300
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:53,180
- Mr Louison. - I don't know him. No names. No I.D.

301
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:56,886
- We're at war, girlie. - We're outlaws. He's Rolls.

302
00:52:57,099 --> 00:52:59,338
- Voltange. - Rolan. Tourneur. Milan.

303
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:02,720
- Trap. - Pank. Fox. Paumeau.

304
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,973
- We watch out for moles. - You could be one.

305
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:11,675
- I'm not a liar. It's the truth. - You, a surfacer¡H Talk about truth¡H

306
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:15,054
Do you know what this is¡H Take a close look.

307
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:20,173
- Your brother Matt's shirt. - Shot down like a rabbit.

308
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:24,681
- Now that's the truth. - Common game. That's all we are.

309
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:27,758
- And you're predators. - Not me. I swear.

310
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:31,305
- You're one of them. A carnivore. - What¡H

311
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:34,431
Is that the way you rats treat ladies¡H

312
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:44,839
- Hey, watch it¡I - For God's sake¡I

313
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,756
Oh, my God.

314
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,805
Tell Calamity Jane to smarten up, or all hell will break loose.

315
00:53:55,017 --> 00:53:58,927
- Got it. - A month's harvest is on the floor.

316
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:01,346
- Plus the risks. - Matt died for that.

317
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,129
Right. Tell her.

318
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:07,348
Corn...

319
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:15,014
There's plenty more in my building. 30 large bags in my dad's cellar.

320
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:20,130
- What's this guy of yours look like¡H - Louison, Rolls...

321
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:24,261
Yeah, the guy you want us to pick up.

322
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:35,880
- Can I help you, miss¡H - No, just an old coffee grinder.

323
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:38,933
Coffee¡H Some people have it made.

324
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:42,673
So you went for a walk last night¡H A long one at that.

325
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:47,632
First ruckus, then screams. This building is a madhouse.

326
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:51,679
Your father may work at night, but this is going too far.

327
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:03,346
There you are, Julie.

328
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:09,892
You OK¡H

329
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:17,555
Sorry, I was just rehearsing a new number.

330
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:20,517
Hold on...

331
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,600
Here.

332
00:55:34,477 --> 00:55:37,095
Didn't you hear anything last night¡H

333
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,058
No, your tea made sure ofthat.

334
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:43,136
A pot of tea a night, just as you prescribed.

335
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:46,468
I'll get you some more, you're almost all out.

336
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:50,430
You should drink some, too. You look exhausted.

337
00:55:57,825 --> 00:56:02,032
- Cheer up, she died a natural death. - Come on, let's go.

338
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:06,366
But still, I'd have liked to say goodbye.

339
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:09,242
Why don't we do that right now¡H

340
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:22,989
Poor Robert.

341
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:28,904
What made you rush out into the stairwell at night anyway¡H

342
00:56:30,742 --> 00:56:34,273
I did it for Aurore. I wanted to save her.

343
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:38,023
I'm telling you, she wasn't the one who screamed.

344
00:56:38,243 --> 00:56:41,240
Anyway, here you go.

345
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:43,322
Still, I did it for her.

346
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:47,065
The butcher was very decent. He apologised.

347
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:50,731
Invite you to dinner¡H I haven't got much.

348
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:54,529
That's fine. That way we won't feel weighed down.

349
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:57,739
- At 9 p.m.¡H - Sharp. I'm always on time.

350
00:56:57,951 --> 00:57:03,531
- Rather unusual for a girl, right¡H - For a girl, you're rather unusual.

351
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:05,862
I owe you a lot, you know¡H

352
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:10,114
- Did you forgive them... - For Livingstone¡H

353
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:16,571
- One must always forgive. - Depends. It's not always possible.

354
00:57:16,784 --> 00:57:20,031
Don't say that. No one is completely evil.

355
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:25,907
It depends on circumstance. Or they don't realise they've done wrong.

356
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:58,401
36th sector, 5th division. Squirmer's Avenue.

357
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:03,193
What did that girl say¡H The girl¡I

358
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:10,076
Sector 3/4, 69¡Hnorth-east.

359
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,773
Albumin Square. Here. All right, let's go.

360
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:22,823
Scout to Sauce Master. Heading towards target, 69¡Hnorth-east.

361
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:28,819
Sauce Master to Scout. Read you, over and out.

362
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:33,607
Watch your backsides, guys¡I

363
00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:58,283
Come, Aurore...

364
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:01,776
They are the worm...

365
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:06,735
you are the fruit.

366
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,407
Not again¡I Darn it¡I

367
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,325
It seems rather quiet.

368
00:59:53,995 --> 00:59:57,823
Not Father's golf clubs.

369
00:59:58,037 --> 01:00:02,492
Yes, Father's clubs...

370
01:00:11,453 --> 01:00:14,865
- Know who's on TV tonight¡H - I don't have a TV.

371
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:18,609
Look, isn't that your customer¡H

372
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:28,578
- Shit. - I'm a bit pressed for time.

373
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:33,906
No offence, but would you permit me to come back later tonight...

374
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:37,154
to pay my respects to your daughter¡H

375
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,911
- Danger, we know not. - Audacious, that's us.

376
01:01:13,122 --> 01:01:15,325
Courageous, give me three.

377
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,405
Generous, you, you, you and me.

378
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:32,534
Scout to Sauce Master. Corn located at site.

379
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:35,780
I repeat: corn located at site.

380
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:39,658
Proceeding with reconnaissance mission. Target: Louison.

381
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:42,786
I repeat: target, Louison.

382
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,319
An ambush.

383
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:30,700
- Aurore, what's the matter now¡H - Georges...

384
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:57,410
Throw in your apron¡H Now I've heard it all.

385
01:02:57,623 --> 01:03:02,031
I've been thinking about it for a while now. I'm getting older.

386
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:05,945
I'm losing my touch. And so many victims...

387
01:03:06,164 --> 01:03:10,109
- I feel sorry for them. - Sorry¡H That's not like you.

388
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:13,412
No one's entirely evil. It's circumstance.

389
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,324
Or they don't realise they've done wrong.

390
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:20,948
Some say you have to be able to forgive. Do you forgive me¡H

391
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,913
An old bastard like you¡H

392
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,404
- Maybe I could. - You're sweet.

393
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:31,616
The guys you finished off wouldn't forgive you, though.

394
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:36,535
- You'd really have to insist on it. - If only Julie could forgive me.

395
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:40,493
- Have you asked her¡H - She wouldn't ever.

396
01:03:40,707 --> 01:03:44,535
- But you're her father. - She won't even speak to me.

397
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:51,075
Want me to go see her¡H I could explain it all to her.

398
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:57,369
All she cares about is that Louison. But then, he's not such a bad guy.

399
01:03:57,582 --> 01:04:03,495
By the way, he's on TV tonight. Why don't you go tell him¡H

400
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:07,321
I bet he doesn't know. He has his head in the clouds.

401
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:21,119
- You should really eat something. - Not hungry.

402
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:23,748
Not hungry.

403
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:26,665
Fox...

404
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,703
You've been hiding things. You're on TV tonight.

405
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:45,577
What do you know about that¡I Livingstone.

406
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,995
The Criekville Casino.

407
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:52,115
Our Tica Tica Walk was a big hit back then.

408
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:54,038
Tica Tica what¡H

409
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,666
Oh, shit.

410
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:40,539
- So that's your new number¡H - I can explain, Julie.

411
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,831
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

412
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:51,953
I messed things up again.

413
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,946
- He's got clown shoes. - Mission accomplished.

414
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,537
We'll wait for the others.

415
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:04,535
Julie¡H

416
01:07:04,752 --> 01:07:09,622
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper. Artichoke Heart Souffl¡H

417
01:07:09,835 --> 01:07:12,702
- Quiet down. - Artichoke Heart Souffl¡H

418
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:18,832
Preparation: H minus 35 minutes. Then the onions. Simmer the snipers.

419
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:24,079
Cover them for about 15 minutes. I repeat: for about 15 minutes.

420
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:30,289
H minus 20 minutes: stir the sauce. I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.

421
01:07:41,419 --> 01:07:43,575
THE STARS OF THE CIRCUS

422
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:52,624
Julie, I didn't think you'd come.

423
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:57,789
- Good evening... - I'll have a cup of tea.

424
01:07:58,002 --> 01:08:01,165
- Pardon¡H - I'll have a cup of tea.

425
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,999
A cup of tea¡H

426
01:08:04,169 --> 01:08:07,120
You have...

427
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:11,585
I'll have one as well.

428
01:08:11,795 --> 01:08:14,461
Yes, a nice cup of tea.

429
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:22,790
Aurore, come and watch. It's spellbinding.

430
01:08:30,378 --> 01:08:35,911
Come, Aurore...

431
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:40,417
Come...

432
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:03,831
- You're wearing... - I found some contact lenses.

433
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:08,204
...they'll titillate us. Here's Stan and Livingstone.

434
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:23,501
- You never told me about this. - Julie...

435
01:09:23,712 --> 01:09:27,373
that's Livingstone. Livingstone, Julie.

436
01:09:59,045 --> 01:10:02,825
- I don't believe this. - It's the antenna, Dad.

437
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:05,617
- What a drag. - It's the antenna.

438
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:09,996
- Go and fix the wire. - In this storm¡H No way.

439
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,413
That bastard.

440
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:23,502
It's the antenna. Because of the wind.

441
01:10:34,338 --> 01:10:35,878
Louison.

442
01:10:43,338 --> 01:10:47,034
Aurore...

443
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:49,707
come...

444
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:56,954
It's so much better here, near us...

445
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:18,294
Come...

446
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:36,495
Louison...

447
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,869
- What¡H - Come back.

448
01:11:39,089 --> 01:11:40,711
I can't hear you.

449
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,919
Come back.

450
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:47,995
Go back inside, Julie.

451
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:51,961
Watch out.

452
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:11,540
Mr Louison¡H

453
01:12:25,048 --> 01:12:26,588
No...

454
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,079
To the right.

455
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:08,130
A bit more.

456
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:19,920
Yes. OK. Perfect. Perfect¡I

457
01:13:20,132 --> 01:13:22,536
Leave it the way is. Perfect.

458
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:29,001
Georges...

459
01:13:31,632 --> 01:13:33,173
Aurore¡H

460
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:04,088
- No more Robert... - I fell.

461
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:11,291
That pervert who just wants to drag you down into the mire...

462
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:15,796
down into the sewer, into the sew...

463
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,581
- So it was you all along. - No.

464
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:24,465
Since when have you been doing this¡H

465
01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:27,874
- No, I can explain. - You bastard.

466
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:32,664
It comes from downstairs. You'll hurt your leg, Robert.

467
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:36,505
Stop.

468
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,132
Help, help¡I

469
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:59,881
You shit. Son of a bitch.

470
01:15:00,092 --> 01:15:02,580
- I fell. - Yes, Aurore.

471
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,881
I wanted to get up on the chair. I fell.

472
01:15:06,092 --> 01:15:07,632
Yes, Aurore.

473
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:26,086
The Troglos. The Troglos are kidnapping someone.

474
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:28,420
Les Troglos...

475
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:48,915
How nice of you to make coffee, Julie. Expecting company¡H

476
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,462
Take your clothes off.

477
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:18,502
- Julie, hurry. - That Interligator woman...

478
01:16:18,718 --> 01:16:22,462
blew herself up sky high. Took her husband with her.

479
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:27,416
Where are you going¡H Stop them, Robert.

480
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:36,958
Julie, what are you doing here¡H Wipe that muck off your face.

481
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:41,668
Do you hear me¡H Go home this instant. And wipe off that lipstick.

482
01:16:41,885 --> 01:16:47,218
And you, I'll skin you alive. Just you wait. I'll get you yet.

483
01:16:47,426 --> 01:16:49,297
I'll get you.

484
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:53,413
Just you wait.

485
01:16:58,677 --> 01:17:02,173
- Who goes there¡H - Snipers.

486
01:17:04,885 --> 01:17:09,921
How did it go¡H Everything all right¡H Everybody OK¡H

487
01:17:10,136 --> 01:17:13,217
Hey, Tourneur, look what I found.

488
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:19,671
- Yes, but how about the others¡H - Here they are.

489
01:17:25,677 --> 01:17:30,298
- How did it go¡H - Easy. Virtually fell into our arms.

490
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:34,041
And we're all here.

491
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,380
Shit.

492
01:17:37,635 --> 01:17:40,586
- Where did she come from¡H - What the hell...

493
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:44,214
- Shit. - Pank...

494
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:49,926
Is that the guy we were supposed to grab¡H The target you located¡H

495
01:17:50,136 --> 01:17:54,958
- Pank, can you explain this to us¡H - Wasn't that the plan¡H

496
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:59,384
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison." That's what it says.

497
01:17:59,594 --> 01:18:04,464
But it also says: "Sex: male. Shoes: that of a clown's."

498
01:18:04,678 --> 01:18:10,674
- Then we'd better check it out. - Sex: male. Male¡I

499
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:15,293
- So¡H What of it¡H - OK, so tell me, is the sex male¡H

500
01:18:15,511 --> 01:18:19,551
Not my problem. Our mission was Louison. You got it.

501
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:25,923
Louison...is the package here male¡H Yes or no¡H

502
01:18:29,678 --> 01:18:32,167
I guess we should check it out.

503
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:40,717
Sorry, Louison, just part of the job.

504
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:44,875
I must have landed in a loony bin.

505
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:50,048
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit. There's been a mistake, so let me go.

506
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:53,212
See, guys¡H Female through and through.

507
01:18:55,637 --> 01:19:00,626
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers. Artichoke Heart here.

508
01:19:00,845 --> 01:19:06,544
I repeat: Artichoke Heart. In immediate danger.

509
01:19:06,762 --> 01:19:10,886
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.

510
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:16,879
- Artichoke Heart is in danger. - We'll knock them off like flies.

511
01:19:18,012 --> 01:19:23,048
- Must be cooking up there. - You can count on those weirdos.

512
01:19:23,262 --> 01:19:26,758
- They'll fix your buddy for good. - Should we go¡H

513
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,589
Of course you're going. All of you.

514
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:33,004
- Doesn't she ever shut up¡H - They play rough.

515
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:36,134
But an agreement is an agreement.

516
01:19:38,262 --> 01:19:44,258
Who's not in¡H Rap, you're coming with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur...

517
01:19:44,471 --> 01:19:49,293
- You take the others. Move it. - But what about me¡H

518
01:19:49,512 --> 01:19:52,001
What about me¡H

01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:57,838
Don't forget about me. What about me¡H

520
01:19:58,055 --> 01:19:59,879
You assholes.

521
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:20,928
In case I don't come back.

522
01:20:23,596 --> 01:20:25,420
Open up.

523
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:34,174
Give it up, you dimwit. We'll let you go. I swear.

524
01:20:34,388 --> 01:20:40,301
We won't touch you. We'll forget the whole thing, OK¡H

525
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:48,882
- My cleavers. All of them. - Right, the cleavers. Kill them off.

526
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:52,544
- Think you're on a safari, bitch¡H - That's my wife.

527
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:58,630
- No men or women, only volunteers. - You got it. Obedient volunteers.

528
01:21:01,138 --> 01:21:06,838
Harm one hair of my daughter's head, and I'll carve you up into pieces.

529
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:14,425
- So, go get my cleavers. Move it. - On the double.

530
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,467
Where are you¡H

531
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:34,336
Where are you¡H

532
01:21:36,097 --> 01:21:38,171
I don't like this one bit.

533
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:47,044
It won't be long now. Julie, get out of here.

534
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:51,838
Yes. It's me they're after.

535
01:21:52,056 --> 01:21:56,381
Don't cry. I'll be all right.

536
01:21:56,598 --> 01:21:58,884
- Don't cry. - It's my contacts.

537
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:00,638
What¡H

538
01:22:22,223 --> 01:22:28,219
Julie, there's only one thing left to do.

539
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:44,930
Go on, push. Push.

540
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:08,008
- What are you doing¡H Move your butt. - Can't. I've gained too much weight.

541
01:24:11,558 --> 01:24:16,547
Wait, turn back. Tourneur, wait.

542
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:26,223
- Shit, Tourneur's been hit. - Tourneur's been hit.

543
01:24:42,058 --> 01:24:46,550
- Hey, postman. Everything OK¡H - I got one. Come and see.

544
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:00,970
- These monsters are everywhere. - They've lost one.

545
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:03,221
They won't be back.

546
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:18,220
Good ol' Tourneur. Hang in there.

547
01:25:21,392 --> 01:25:24,058
That lead really weighs you down.

548
01:25:25,351 --> 01:25:30,138
- No other damage¡H - Don't worry. We'll get you out.

549
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:33,846
You all right¡H

550
01:26:49,893 --> 01:26:53,056
Come on, push.

551
01:26:55,768 --> 01:26:58,007
Let me through.

552
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:14,680
- I don't believe this. - Water's running.

553
01:27:15,769 --> 01:27:19,466
What the hell are they doing¡H Stand back.

554
01:27:22,519 --> 01:27:24,757
What the hell are they up to¡H

555
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:53,433

Go on¡I Go¡I Go¡I

558
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:08,017
Julie, follow me.

559

Be careful¡I

560
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,050
Not a minute too soon.

561
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:53,350
Miss Plusse, you're a dragonfly in mating season. So a toad like me...

562
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:58,765
Get lost, jerk. I'm in a rush. Let the lady by, will you¡H

563
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,894
I go from one footbath to another. Shit.

564
01:30:08,147 --> 01:30:10,681
I despise you. I hate you.

565
01:30:25,772 --> 01:30:28,853
This time you're done for, clown.

566
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:36,226
- Cut the bullshit. - Right. Cut the bullshit.

567
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:39,009
Now you're going to start singing.

568
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,763
My cleaver, damn it. Hand it over.

569
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,385
- Here, butcher. - You, here¡H

570
01:30:49,605 --> 01:30:52,176
This is a job for the Australian.

571
01:30:57,022 --> 01:31:01,146
At any rate, you came at the right time.

572
01:31:03,647 --> 01:31:05,188
No...

573
01:31:17,106 --> 01:31:20,934
- Oh, my God... - Goddamn Troglos.

574
01:31:28,023 --> 01:31:31,968
Bastards. My Julie...

575
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:35,271
It's all your fault. You'll pay for this.

576
01:31:54,232 --> 01:31:58,225
I've got something stuck in my head, right¡H

577
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:02,479
Answer me, sausage head.

You, tell me. I'm not dreaming, am I¡H I've got something stuck...
