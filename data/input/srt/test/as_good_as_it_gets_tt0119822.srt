1
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:34,025
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

2
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:40,073
It's tulip season today
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:46,329
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:49,457
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:57,382
Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:05,515
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:09,685
Come on, go for a ride.

8
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,979
No! Freeze!

9
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,733
Leg down! Leg down!

10
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,695
That's it. Come on.

11
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,952
No! You monkey-eared son of a ...

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,957
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:35,753
I'll bet you wish
you were a real ...

14
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:39,090
You dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:45,763
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

16
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,233
Verdell?

17
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,361
Verdell?

18
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,158
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

19
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,120
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,040
Mr. Udall?

21
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,921
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

22
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:28,097
My dog. You know ...
My dog with the adorable face.

23
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:34,562
- Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

24
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,358
I thought it was that coloured man.

25
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,904
Which colour was that?

26
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:48,326
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

27
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,662
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

28
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,459
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

29
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:01,672
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

30
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:06,052
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,180
- I don't care
where you shove your show.

32
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,185
Are we done being neighbours?

33
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:22,110
- Let me ...
- No! Not worth it.

34
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:34,622
- Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

35
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:01,733
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:05,486
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,469
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

38
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:53,451
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

39
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,579
- Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

40
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:04,087
My honey. Where have you been?

41
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,717
Look at my boy.

42
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,642
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

43
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,353
Where was my baby?

44
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:27,860
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

45
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:33,908
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

46
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:41,207
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator ...

47
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:46,629
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

48
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:54,971
"In the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven."

49
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,099
"This is what you live for,
he said."

50
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,853
"Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval."

51
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,858
"There is only the safety
of being with each other."

52
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:12,697
"How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?"

53
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:18,536
- Mr. Udall!
- "She was able to define love."

54
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,038
"Love was ..."

55
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:26,878
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

56
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,466
- "Love was ..."
- Are you in there?

57
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,802
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

58
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,930
Yes?

59
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,641
This can wait.

60
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,812
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

61
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:53,362
Well ... That's a load off.

62
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,742
Did you ... do something to him?

63
00:06:57,742 --> 00:07:03,581
Do you realize
that I work at home?

64
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,003
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

65
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:15,885
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

66
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:20,056
- And put a piece of cardboard ...
- I work all the time.

67
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:24,227
So never interrupt me!

68
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:29,232
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -

69
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,237
- and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -

70
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:39,659
- and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

71
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:43,413
Even then, don't come knocking.

72
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:49,460
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -

73
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,299
- because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

74
00:07:55,299 --> 00:08:00,304
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -

75
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,475
- and you want someone
to share the moment with.

76
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:10,314
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

77
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:13,860
Not for any reason.

78
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:17,822
Do you get me, sweetheart?

79
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:25,121
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

80
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,292
Okay, then.

81
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,392
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

82
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,696
"Love was ..."

83
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,493
What was love?

84
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:07,663
"Love was ..."

85
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,545
Now I'm really pissed!

86
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,133
Don't touch!

87
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:24,138
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

88
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:28,101
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

89
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:35,191
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

90
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,362
Assault! And you're black!

91
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,950
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -

92
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:48,955
- if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

93
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:57,714
Meantime ... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

94
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:02,927
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

95
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,221
Have a nice day.

96
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,724
Party!

97
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:31,497
- Don't touch.
- Get a life.

98
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,668
Watch it.

99
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,721
- Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

100
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,266
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

101
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:55,063
I'm walking out the door, he says,
"l promise not to get a cough."

102
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:59,233
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

103
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:05,490
I said, "You love me the way
you love your remote control."

104
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,784
That's great.

105
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:12,997
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

106
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,334
- Eat up!
- I've got your money.

107
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,713
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

108
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,799
Excuse me, Melvin.

109
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,638
There you go.

110
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:36,771
Pardon me.
Take the money.

111
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:43,027
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

112
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:48,241
- I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

113
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:54,080
Spence is more excited about it
than I am.

114
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,834
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to ...

115
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:02,213
- I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

116
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,341
You can sit
at someone else's station.

117
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:10,138
Or you can wait your turn.

118
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,607
How much more have you got to eat?

119
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:28,906
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

120
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,826
That's it!

121
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,328
Let's go.

122
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:39,333
He's barred for life.

123
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,889
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

124
00:12:54,557 --> 00:13:00,396
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

125
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,524
I'm going to miss the excitement.

126
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,278
Three eggs, over easy.

127
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,657
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

128
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:16,037
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

129
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,373
You'll die soon, with that diet.

130
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:25,213
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

131
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:45,650
If you ever mention my son again ...

132
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,863
... you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

133
00:13:56,494 --> 00:14:02,333
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

134
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,381
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

135
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,888
Do you?

136
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,647
Yes ...

137
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:35,700
I'll get your order.

138
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,036
Wear my earrings tonight.

139
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:46,544
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

140
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:56,971
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it ...

141
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,725
I sort of sleep in here.

142
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,195
Don't worry about it.

143
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,471
What?

144
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,225
I don't know.

145
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,026
Grandma ...

146
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,865
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

147
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,373
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything ...

148
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:09,544
I put these on to give you privacy.

149
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,463
How was dinner?

150
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:19,137
- How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

151
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:24,559
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

152
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,521
I have him ...

153
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,483
- One more spit?
- He's waiting.

154
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,194
Go.

155
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:39,157
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.

156
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:44,579
- Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

157
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,295
Close the curtains.

158
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,594
No! He can't take smoke.

159
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:04,182
Magic.

160
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:17,737
God! That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

161
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,865
Come here.

162
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:36,089
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- "Little bit of throw-up"?

163
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:41,719
What shall we do?

164
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,473
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay ...

165
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,810
No. I'll take a cab.

166
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,862
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

167
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,953
I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

168
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:11,332
<i>Take me off the speaker.</i>
<i>These are house seats.

169
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:18,423
<i>Come on. You could use a break.</i>
<i>Hello? Carl? You there?

170
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,968
Okay. I just found a model.

171
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:27,807
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.

172
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,272
What's going on?

173
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:39,277
- Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

174
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,822
You picked me up some time ago.

175
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,993
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

176
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,789
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

177
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:56,169
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

178
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,093
Who is it, baby?

179
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:10,141
Who is it, Verdell?

180
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,563
I'm sorry. I told you today.

181
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,691
I was out in the studio and I ...

182
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,819
It's out here.

183
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,364
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

184
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:30,161
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

185
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,706
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

186
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:40,171
This is not a nude.

187
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,716
Just kidding around.

188
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,844
So much for love.

189
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,598
And yet another pose.

190
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:57,271
- What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

191
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:04,570
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

192
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,784
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

193
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:15,623
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

194
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,377
No direction.

195
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:25,633
What I do is, I watch.

196
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,847
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

197
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:35,643
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

198
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:41,274
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

199
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:46,904
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

200
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:51,909
They're just sort of realer
and more alive.

201
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:57,749
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

202
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:04,630
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:14,432
Oh, my God ... Hold it.

204
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,811
Look out.

205
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,897
Excuse me.

206
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:26,110
I got on the third line of dialogue.

207
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,238
And all of a sudden I blanked.

208
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,532
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

209
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:36,120
- So he said to me, "Last chance."
- Last chance.

210
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,457
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

211
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:44,045
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

212
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,964
He cast me!

213
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:51,969
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

214
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:01,562
Can't live without me?

215
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:08,861
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

216
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,032
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

217
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:18,454
- It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

218
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:23,876
"Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out."

219
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,967
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

220
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:43,479
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

221
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:49,736
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection ...

222
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:55,158
- Is this bothering you?
- No.

223
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:00,997
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -

224
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:05,168
- where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

225
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,670
Nice chatting.

226
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:12,467
- His name?
- Spencer.

227
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,931
Spence.

228
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:28,107
It's okay. Go on.

229
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:40,203
Put on anything you want.

230
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:44,791
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play!

231
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:06,687
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

232
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,115
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

233
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,381
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

234
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:38,177
Wait! I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

235
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:42,140
- Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

236
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,642
I'm going to look at the painting.

237
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,898
Where are you going?

238
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,155
Want some water?
What's the matter?

239
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,449
You want some water?

240
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:05,496
Simon, wait!

241
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,345
Why are you doing this?

242
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:25,516
No, wait ...

243
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:29,270
- That painting in there ...
- Are you cruising him?

244
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,114
Excuse me ...

245
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,868
- Help me!
- Come on!

246
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,622
Come on.

247
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:03,679
You call 911
and don't leave your name?

248
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:08,476
- Even a dumb geezer knows ...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

249
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:10,770
Ask him.

250
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:15,358
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

251
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:19,529
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

252
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:26,619
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

253
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:30,581
Go shake down a 7-11
for a day-old wiener.

254
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:35,169
There's a painting
of one of the guys.

255
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,511
- I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

256
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:47,890
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

257
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:51,018
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

258
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:56,858
Old bitch. Damn dog.

259
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,905
You're taking him!

260
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:05,199
Get out of the way!

261
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:08,327
Even the books.

262
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,247
Wait!

263
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:15,418
Do you want to say no to me?

264
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,385
I don't want to say nothing to you.

265
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:31,267
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

266
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:36,689
Thanks for looking after him.

267
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:43,988
- Hey! Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

268
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:48,993
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

269
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:55,249
Hey, Frank.

270
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:22,151
One, two, three, four ...

271
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:44,465
You're dead.

272
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:48,636
We don't have no dog food here.

273
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:53,224
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

274
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,902
Don't you do anything!

275
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,211
Where's the trust?

276
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,932
Never a break.

277
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,716
God!

278
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:13,721
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

279
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,266
No, we can't reduce the price.

280
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:22,480
- I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

281
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:27,068
I'll meet you in there, okay?

282
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:31,239
Thank you.

283
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,329
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

284
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:43,126
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

285
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,922
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and ...

286
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:57,932
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

287
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:02,520
The scars might ... Oh, shit!

288
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,445
Jackie ...

289
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:13,573
Hand me a mirror, please.

290
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,251
Wait. I have a smaller one.

291
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,598
So how are things, anyway?

292
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:44,228
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall ... taking care of him.

293
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:50,067
- How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

294
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:55,072
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

295
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,201
I'm always on the move and ...

296
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,329
Trust me.

297
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:06,125
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

298
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:16,552
Waiting gives the devil time.

299
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:35,947
Oh, my!

300
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:48,668
Where did I go?

301
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,839
- That's your dog?
- No.

302
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:57,009
What are you doing with a dog?

303
00:32:57,427 --> 00:33:02,223
- Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

304
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:08,271
No, not until now.

305
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:12,442
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

306
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:14,944
Hey, puppy.

307
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:19,323
It's so cute.

308
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:22,452
I wonder what breed he is.

309
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:30,793
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

310
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:36,215
How old are you?

311
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,761
To guess by your eyes ... 50.

312
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:44,557
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

313
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:49,145
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

314
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:54,150
- Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

315
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:58,946
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

316
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:02,700
What's with the dark?

317
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:07,497
Dawn patrol.

318
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:11,459
My son had
a full-blown attack.

319
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:16,881
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

320
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,801
No!

321
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:24,180
It's bacon for the dog.

322
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:30,228
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

323
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:36,901
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

324
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:50,039
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

325
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:05,680
Look at that dog.

326
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:10,893
I've got to give you
something real good.

327
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,064
I'm going to show it to you.

328
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:19,444
Don't be like me.

329
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:25,283
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

330
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:30,496
I'd like to be treated like that.

331
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:36,127
Let's go home and do some writing.

332
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:42,175
"He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl."

333
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:46,137
"You've saved my life, she said."

334
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,142
"You'd better make it up to me."

335
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:59,901
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

336
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,280
62 books. Done.

337
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:10,536
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

338
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:15,750
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

339
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,712
- Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

340
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:23,049
And all the laundry.

341
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:32,016
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

342
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:37,855
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

343
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:44,529
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

344
00:36:56,207 --> 00:37:02,046
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

345
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,473
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

346
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:17,270
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

347
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:22,900
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

348
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:28,531
Okay.

349
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:37,290
Hungry? Be right with you.

350
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,772
Mr. Udall.

351
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:52,573
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like ...

352
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:56,536
Could you take it ...

353
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:00,706
... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

354
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:05,920
Thank you.

355
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:11,134
Verdell.

356
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:16,764
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

357
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:20,309
Let's go home and get well.

358
00:39:21,352 --> 00:39:26,357
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

359
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:33,030
Thank you.

360
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:39,287
Come on, sweetheart.

361
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:42,832
Verdell, come here.

362
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:48,045
I know what you want.

363
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:54,093
Where's my boy?

364
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:03,478
No, don't force him.

365
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:39,555
Over a dog!

366
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:43,726
Over an ugly dog.

367
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:55,613
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

368
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:07,083
- Help!
- You'll make an appointment.

369
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:11,254
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -

370
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:14,590
- and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

371
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,136
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

372
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:23,766
- What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility ...

373
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:27,937
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

374
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:32,108
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

375
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:36,279
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

376
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:40,658
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

377
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:44,412
No, we're not doing this now.

378
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,834
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

379
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,336
No. Nope.

380
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:06,517
What if this is
as good as it gets?

381
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,324
What the heck are those for?

382
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:26,537
No, no, no. Get Carol.

383
00:42:26,537 --> 00:42:32,376
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

384
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,050
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

385
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:43,429
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

386
00:42:43,638 --> 00:42:49,268
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

387
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:52,396
I'll pay whatever you want.

388
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,193
Do it!

389
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:03,241
Bryan. Code blue.

390
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:12,834
Out! Just shut up and get out.

391
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:19,715
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

392
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:24,303
Go get Carol.

393
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,934
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

394
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:35,356
This day has been a disaster.

395
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:39,944
- I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!

396
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:47,452
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

397
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:04,760
See you.

398
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:08,097
It's about time.

399
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:15,396
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

400
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:27,074
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

401
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,253
I'm hungry.

402
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:23,798
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

403
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:27,969
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing ...

404
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:31,722
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

405
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:39,439
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

406
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:44,652
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

407
00:45:44,652 --> 00:45:50,700
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

408
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:00,293
Yes, I do.

409
00:46:01,127 --> 00:46:06,966
And to prove it ... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

410
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:11,971
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

411
00:46:14,056 --> 00:46:17,602
You don't look sick.

412
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:21,773
Just tired and bitter.

413
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:26,986
My son is sick.

414
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,408
What about your mother?

415
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:38,456
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

416
00:46:38,664 --> 00:46:42,627
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

417
00:46:51,803 --> 00:46:54,096
How are you doing?

418
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:02,021
You should answer me.

419
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:07,026
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

420
00:47:09,946 --> 00:47:12,448
Back to life.

421
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:22,667
What's wrong?

422
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:29,132
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand ...

423
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:36,013
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

424
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,436
Look out, you guys!

425
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:46,858
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

426
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:51,237
Melvin! Wait!

427
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:55,199
Melvin! Wait!

428
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:04,167
Shut up, kids!

429
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:07,712
Give us a lift, would you?

430
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:15,219
Cover your mouth when you cough.

431
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:22,518
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

432
00:48:23,144 --> 00:48:28,357
- Any chance you'll be back today?
- No! Stay away from me.

433
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:38,785
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to ...

434
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:43,581
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

435
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:48,169
Sorry.

436
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,093
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

437
00:48:56,928 --> 00:49:01,933
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

438
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:07,563
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

439
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:09,440
SIMON, YOU'RE BROKE

440
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:21,119
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

441
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:26,124
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

442
00:49:26,332 --> 00:49:30,294
But they'd feel strange calling you.

443
00:49:30,503 --> 00:49:35,091
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

444
00:49:36,342 --> 00:49:38,219
Come here.

445
00:49:38,427 --> 00:49:42,390
Verdell? What's wrong?

446
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:46,978
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

447
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:52,191
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

448
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,111
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:58,030
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

450
00:49:58,239 --> 00:49:59,907
Sorry ...

451
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:06,789
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

452
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,463
Oh, my God!

453
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:47,663
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate ...

454
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:54,754
I need this.
Just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

455
00:50:57,465 --> 00:51:01,427
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

456
00:51:01,636 --> 00:51:07,892
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

457
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,940
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

458
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:29,372
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

459
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,751
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

460
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,462
What does it mean to you?

461
00:51:36,879 --> 00:51:41,467
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

462
00:51:42,718 --> 00:51:45,012
God, this is like a nightmare.

463
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,809
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

464
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:57,525
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

465
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:02,321
And I take away reason
and accountability.

466
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:36,105
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

467
00:52:36,314 --> 00:52:39,442
- Please, what?
- I'm ...

468
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,361
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.

469
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,366
- Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

470
00:52:47,992 --> 00:52:52,371
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

471
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,500
I'm home.

472
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,879
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

473
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,258
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

474
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:07,595
Okay, doctor?

475
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:11,349
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

476
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:16,979
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

477
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:21,359
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

478
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:25,530
- In Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

479
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:28,241
Excuse me.

480
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:34,080
- I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

481
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:40,753
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

482
00:53:40,962 --> 00:53:47,009
- Did you say "today"?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

483
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:53,474
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

484
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:59,313
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

485
00:53:59,522 --> 00:54:02,650
- And how he felt.
- Good.

486
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:07,447
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

487
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:10,366
Have they done blood tests?

488
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:14,328
- When he was well?
- No.

489
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:17,874
- And how about skin testing?
- No.

490
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:21,002
- No standard scratch test?
- No.

491
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:26,841
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

492
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:31,429
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

493
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:37,059
- I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

494
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:45,401
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

495
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,363
Me.
My home number is on the card.

496
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:53,534
His home number.

497
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:01,876
- What?
- Your home ...

498
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:11,260
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

499
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,223
Couple of female slaves?

500
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:20,228
There's still a lot of tests
I need to do.

501
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:24,190
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -

502
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:29,195
- from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

503
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:40,039
Doc!

504
00:55:44,627 --> 00:55:48,589
That's good.

505
00:55:54,011 --> 00:55:57,974
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll ...

506
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:02,145
The costs
are going to be considerable.

507
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:07,358
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

508
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:12,780
That's wonderful.

509
00:56:16,117 --> 00:56:19,662
Thank you for everything, Nora.

510
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:25,293
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

511
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:38,222
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

512
00:56:40,308 --> 00:56:42,393
No!

513
00:56:56,991 --> 00:57:01,162
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

514
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:08,252
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

515
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:14,717
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

516
00:57:15,968 --> 00:57:22,225
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

517
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:28,689
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

518
00:57:28,898 --> 00:57:33,903
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

519
00:57:34,111 --> 00:57:38,699
Did you learn to talk like this in
a "Sailor, wanna hump-hump"-bar?

520
00:57:38,908 --> 00:57:42,036
Or is this your last shot
at his whisky?

521
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:46,624
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

522
00:57:54,757 --> 00:58:00,805
No! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

523
00:58:00,805 --> 00:58:06,227
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

524
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:11,649
This lets a crazy man
into our lives.

525
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,488
You know how this will turn out.

526
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:22,910
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

527
00:58:27,498 --> 00:58:30,001
Right?

528
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:40,011
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

529
00:58:40,845 --> 00:58:44,807
FRIENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

530
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:47,518
Bye.

531
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:50,229
Bye-bye.

532
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:56,277
What a day ...

533
00:58:56,694 --> 00:58:59,822
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

534
00:59:00,031 --> 00:59:02,742
Thank you for walking him.

535
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:10,041
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

536
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:12,543
Go away.

537
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:18,174
- This cleaning lady doesn't ..?
- Please, just leave.

538
00:59:19,634 --> 00:59:24,639
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!

539
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:33,397
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

540
00:59:34,857 --> 00:59:39,654
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

541
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:46,744
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

542
00:59:46,953 --> 00:59:50,081
You'll be back on your knees
in no time.

543
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,968
Is this fun for you?

544
01:00:02,593 --> 01:00:08,641
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

545
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:13,646
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

546
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,357
And I won't.

547
01:00:16,566 --> 01:00:19,902
I don't want to paint any more.

548
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,447
The life I was trying for, is over.

549
01:00:23,656 --> 01:00:29,495
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

550
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:35,543
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

551
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:38,671
Terrified!

552
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:54,312
I was trying to give you a boost.

553
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,108
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

554
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:03,696
You absolute horror
of a human being.

555
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:21,422
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

556
01:01:21,631 --> 01:01:24,133
Get out.

557
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:28,304
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

558
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:31,224
It's a trick.

559
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:36,437
I keep bacon in my pocket.

560
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:39,357
See?

561
01:01:44,987 --> 01:01:50,827
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

562
01:01:59,168 --> 01:02:02,713
Come here, Verdell.

563
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,012
Come on.

564
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:12,306
Come here.

565
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,482
Just a stupid dog.

566
01:02:24,819 --> 01:02:28,781
Could you leave now? Please?

567
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:34,412
I don't get it.

568
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:12,844
Mr. Udall!

569
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,057
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

570
01:04:27,859 --> 01:04:32,446
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

571
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:41,205
If you ...

572
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:50,798
- If it's about thanking me ...
- That's not why I'm here.

573
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:56,220
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

574
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:02,894
Note. Put it in a note.

575
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:17,074
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

576
01:05:21,245 --> 01:05:26,459
- So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

577
01:05:29,796 --> 01:05:33,341
I'm worried you did this ...

578
01:05:48,356 --> 01:05:53,361
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

579
01:05:55,655 --> 01:05:58,366
Look ...

580
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:05,456
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

581
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:09,836
Clear what up?

582
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:16,300
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

583
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:19,846
Not ever!

584
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:28,813
I'm sorry, but ...

585
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:36,112
... we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

586
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:43,202
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

587
01:06:44,871 --> 01:06:49,667
Just ... thank you.

588
01:06:55,089 --> 01:06:58,217
So you will be at work tomorrow?

589
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,222
Yes.

590
01:07:18,029 --> 01:07:21,365
"Never", she said.

591
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:43,679
I took a chance you were up.

592
01:07:43,888 --> 01:07:47,225
I brought you some Chinese soup.

593
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:51,604
Thanks.

594
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,833
I've never been this tired
in my life.

595
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:22,260
I haven't been sleeping.

596
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:28,724
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

597
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:34,355
I'm in trouble.

598
01:08:34,772 --> 01:08:37,483
It's not just the tiredness.

599
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:43,322
- Sick. Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

600
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:49,787
Everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

601
01:08:49,996 --> 01:08:53,749
You can barely find the will
to complain.

602
01:08:57,712 --> 01:09:01,257
I'm glad we did this.

603
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:05,219
Good talking to you.

604
01:09:12,935 --> 01:09:19,400
- Still writing that thank-you note?
- How do you spell "conscience"?

605
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,737
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

606
01:09:22,945 --> 01:09:28,159
Look, I got Sean to babysit
so we could go out.

607
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:32,330
I don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

608
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:37,543
Spencer's okay. Start finding
something to do with your free time.

609
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:42,131
Sean, are you hungry?

610
01:09:43,174 --> 01:09:49,430
We got pizza. Sausage, pepperoni.
You want to make this later?

611
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:54,852
We are going out, like people do.

612
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:03,194
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little, -

613
01:10:03,194 --> 01:10:08,407
- then you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

614
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:11,744
I don't need one.
I know what's going on here.

615
01:10:14,664 --> 01:10:20,711
I must finish this letter first.
This can't be right? Con-science?

616
01:10:21,337 --> 01:10:23,631
Carol!

617
01:10:27,802 --> 01:10:30,930
What?

618
01:10:45,945 --> 01:10:49,073
It's very weird not feeling that ...

619
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:54,078
... stupid panic thing inside me.

620
01:10:54,704 --> 01:10:58,457
Without that,
I start thinking about myself.

621
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:02,211
And what good
does that ever get anybody?

622
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:08,468
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

623
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:11,387
And I felt myself ...

624
01:11:12,638 --> 01:11:16,392
... giving them a dirty look.

625
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:22,857
I just had no idea.
Everything was ...

626
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:32,450
Go ahead.

627
01:11:33,701 --> 01:11:37,038
Moving in the wrong direction.

628
01:11:37,663 --> 01:11:44,128
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man ...

629
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:46,631
... to hold fucking ...

630
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:54,764
... hands with.

631
01:11:56,432 --> 01:12:02,688
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

632
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:11,447
Which is probably why I make Spence
hug me more than he wants to.

633
01:12:13,324 --> 01:12:18,329
He has to make up for
his Mom not getting any.

634
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:28,339
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?

635
01:12:28,548 --> 01:12:33,553
Leave me be.
What is it you want?

636
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:40,017
Does getting me thinking about all
that's wrong have some purpose?

637
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:45,231
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

638
01:12:45,648 --> 01:12:50,027
- What?
- I want us to go out.

639
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:24,437
- Thank you.
- I'll send you a thank-you note.

640
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,319
That's why you brought me here?

641
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:33,821
That's why you brought me here?

642
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:39,452
Well, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

643
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,623
But the dog did throw up
twice last night.

644
01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:49,253
- Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

645
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:52,798
- They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it ...

646
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,927
Sorry.

647
01:13:56,135 --> 01:14:01,140
- This is for later.
- What's this?

648
01:14:02,183 --> 01:14:05,937
- It's a note.
- A note?

649
01:14:06,145 --> 01:14:09,690
- A thank-you note.
- No thank you.

650
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:14,695
- You can read it later.
- No thank-you note. No, no.

651
01:14:17,615 --> 01:14:20,743
Thank you.

652
01:14:26,165 --> 01:14:33,047
- She's nice.
- Yeah, really nice.

653
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:40,137
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, "No thanks required"?

654
01:14:42,014 --> 01:14:45,977
Sure looks like it went over, too.

655
01:14:47,019 --> 01:14:50,565
Look at you.

656
01:14:50,773 --> 01:14:55,987
You're making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

657
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:03,911
- What?
- You think I'm a mark ...

658
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,125
You helped with the dog. I'm as
concerned about Simon as you are.

659
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,253
- Concerned?
- He needs more than money.

660
01:15:12,461 --> 01:15:17,258
He must go to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

661
01:15:17,466 --> 01:15:21,220
They have to help. It's the rules.

662
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:25,183
That's great. Let them help him.

663
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:28,936
Only ...

664
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:34,567
... I got a painter coming through,
so I'm out.

665
01:15:35,193 --> 01:15:40,198
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!

666
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:45,411
Take my car? A convertible.

667
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:50,833
- Do you drive?
- Yes. But I'm not doing it.

668
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:53,753
Getting loud.

669
01:15:55,421 --> 01:16:00,635
- He wants me to take his car ...
- I want your problems.

670
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:05,431
Somebody offers me a convertible
so I can get out of this city ...

671
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:16,067
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

672
01:16:16,067 --> 01:16:21,697
I'll take him. Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

673
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:31,916
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

674
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:42,134
If there's some health foundation
for people like you, let me know.

675
01:16:43,177 --> 01:16:47,765
- Last-word freak.
- Good luck, lady.

676
01:16:48,808 --> 01:16:52,145
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

677
01:16:54,438 --> 01:16:58,818
I'm going to give my queer neighbour
a lift to Baltimore.

678
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:07,994
What I did for you ...
It's working out?

679
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:14,041
What you did changed my life.

680
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:17,170
No!

681
01:17:17,587 --> 01:17:20,298
No thank-you note.

682
01:17:20,506 --> 01:17:25,720
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life -

683
01:17:26,137 --> 01:17:31,350
- is that you have done more
for my mother, my son ...

684
01:17:31,559 --> 01:17:35,313
... and me
than anybody else ever has.

685
01:17:35,313 --> 01:17:38,858
I'm just going to read you
this part of it

686
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:45,740
"That makes you the most generous
person I ever met in my life."

687
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:50,536
"And you're going to be
in our daily prayers, forever."

688
01:17:51,996 --> 01:17:54,081
Lovely.

689
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:59,712
I also wrote one part ...
I wrote that I was sorry.

690
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:06,177
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you -

691
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:10,556
- when you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

692
01:18:10,556 --> 01:18:17,230
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I'm sorry for that night ...

693
01:18:17,647 --> 01:18:21,818
... when I said that I was never ...

694
01:18:22,026 --> 01:18:27,657
I'm sorry for every time your food
was cold and you had to wait.

695
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:34,747
And I'm sorry for never spotting the
human being that did this for us.

696
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:40,169
I'll just start from the beginning.

697
01:18:40,378 --> 01:18:43,923
"l have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you."

698
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:49,554
"The word grateful doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel."

699
01:18:53,307 --> 01:18:57,270
That's nice of you. Thank you.

700
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:03,109
Thank you.

701
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:15,413
Now I want you
to do something for me.

702
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:27,300
I'm sorry. Didn't I say "what"?
I thought I did.

703
01:19:30,845 --> 01:19:35,224
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

704
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:38,978
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

705
01:19:39,187 --> 01:19:46,486
He might pull the stiff one-eye
on me. I need you to chaperone.

706
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:53,159
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook. Two days.

707
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:59,207
- I can't. My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

708
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:07,340
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

709
01:20:07,548 --> 01:20:13,596
- I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?

710
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:18,392
Is there any other way to see it?

711
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:22,355
No.

712
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:32,573
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

713
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:44,252
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

714
01:21:08,234 --> 01:21:11,779
- You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

715
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:17,201
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

716
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:21,789
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you're going to say.

717
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:25,126
<i>I mean ... I think I know.

718
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:32,425
- I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

719
01:21:34,927 --> 01:21:38,681
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

720
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,771
<i>Maybe ...

721
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:51,194
- Yes. Let's ... Let's.
- Okay.

722
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:58,284
- What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

723
01:21:58,284 --> 01:22:02,663
Okay, then. Goodnight.

724
01:22:07,877 --> 01:22:12,256
- Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.

725
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:18,721
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.

726
01:22:20,181 --> 01:22:22,058
Lip kiss.

727
01:22:24,977 --> 01:22:30,608
I love you. I'll miss you ...
Real sensitive.

728
01:22:31,442 --> 01:22:35,822
- Bye.
- Call when you're settled.

729
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:47,708
- Have a good time.
- Don't run!

730
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:52,922
Have fun, but don't run.

731
01:22:57,093 --> 01:23:00,638
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you.
- So am l, Frank.

732
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:03,558
Give me a hug.

733
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,311
Everything's going to be okay.

734
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,150
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

735
01:23:18,781 --> 01:23:21,284
Hello.

736
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:31,919
Thank you for being on time.

737
01:23:33,796 --> 01:23:39,218
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

738
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:46,726
Holy God. Who did that to you?

739
01:23:47,143 --> 01:23:52,356
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

740
01:23:52,565 --> 01:23:56,319
And I was hospitalized.

741
01:23:57,361 --> 01:24:02,366
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk later.

742
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,248
- I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?

743
01:24:09,457 --> 01:24:14,253
- There's no place cards.
- You need room.

744
01:24:15,713 --> 01:24:18,424
So I'll sit in the back.

745
01:24:32,396 --> 01:24:35,316
Never a break. Never.

746
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,070
Thank you. It was very thoughtful.

747
01:24:39,904 --> 01:24:43,866
- You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

748
01:24:46,577 --> 01:24:47,829
Thanks.

749
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:57,839
Thank you.

750
01:25:00,132 --> 01:25:02,009
You're welcome.

751
01:25:05,763 --> 01:25:09,517
I've got the whole trip programmed.

752
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:17,441
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

753
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:21,612
TO USE AS ICEBREAKER

754
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:24,949
We've got good stuff here.

755
01:25:39,964 --> 01:25:42,675
I like this music.

756
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,680
I like this music.

757
01:26:01,444 --> 01:26:05,198
I'm sure
they did something really off.

758
01:26:05,406 --> 01:26:12,497
But something will always be off
for you, unless you set it straight.

759
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:18,127
And maybe this thing happened to you
to give you a chance to do that.

760
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:21,255
Nonsense. You want to know why?

761
01:26:21,255 --> 01:26:25,426
Anyone interested in what Melvin
has to say, raise their hand.

762
01:26:33,976 --> 01:26:38,356
Want to know
what happened with my parents?

763
01:26:39,607 --> 01:26:44,403
- When I was ...
- Wait. I'm going to pull over.

764
01:26:48,157 --> 01:26:53,162
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.

765
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:57,333
She was sort of fabulous about it.

766
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:03,589
She ... I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it.

767
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:07,134
And she was very natural.

768
01:27:07,343 --> 01:27:10,888
So she used to pose nude for me.

769
01:27:11,097 --> 01:27:15,893
I always thought
that my father knew about it.

770
01:27:16,102 --> 01:27:19,647
- This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.

771
01:27:19,856 --> 01:27:23,818
- Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop!

772
01:27:25,903 --> 01:27:30,491
Go ahead. Don't let him stop you.

773
01:27:31,325 --> 01:27:36,539
One day he walked in and found us.
And he started screaming.

774
01:27:36,747 --> 01:27:40,084
My father didn't come out
for 11 years.

775
01:27:40,084 --> 01:27:44,881
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

776
01:27:49,677 --> 01:27:55,099
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

777
01:27:55,308 --> 01:27:57,602
Please, come on.

778
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:01,772
He was ...

779
01:28:01,981 --> 01:28:06,777
I was defending my mother.

780
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:13,451
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

781
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:18,664
I said,
"She's not naked. It's art."

782
01:28:21,792 --> 01:28:24,921
And he started hitting me.

783
01:28:25,129 --> 01:28:28,674
He beat me unconscious.

784
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:35,348
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.

785
01:28:36,182 --> 01:28:40,978
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

786
01:28:41,187 --> 01:28:47,235
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

787
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:53,699
A big sweaty wad of money.

788
01:28:54,742 --> 01:28:59,956
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

789
01:29:00,164 --> 01:29:04,126
I just grabbed him
and I hugged him.

790
01:29:04,335 --> 01:29:08,089
And he turned and walked out.

791
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:23,729
- We all have these stories.
- It's not true.

792
01:29:23,938 --> 01:29:26,858
Some of us have great stories.

793
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:32,905
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

794
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:38,119
No one here. But a lot of people.
That's their story ...

795
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:43,958
Good times, noodle salad.
It's not that you had it bad, -

796
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:48,754
- but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

797
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:53,759
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

798
01:29:54,594 --> 01:29:56,679
Not it at all?

799
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:02,518
Let's go to the hotel.

800
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:08,566
You'll see if you can get another
wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

801
01:30:17,742 --> 01:30:20,870
Can I ask you a personal question?

802
01:30:23,372 --> 01:30:26,501
Sure.

803
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:30,671
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

804
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:38,387
- Wouldn't your life be easier ..?
- You consider your life easy?

805
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:44,227
I give you that one.

806
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:49,440
Nice packing.

807
01:30:57,573 --> 01:31:01,953
- Hey, Spence.
<i>- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

808
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:06,541
- Why are you out of breath?
<i>- Mom, I scored a goal.

809
01:31:06,749 --> 01:31:10,711
- You did?
<i>- Yep. He was big. Charlie.

810
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,299
That's great.
Oh my God!

811
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:19,887
<i>- We're playing again. Got to go.</i>
- Wait ...

812
01:31:22,598 --> 01:31:26,978
<i>- He scored a goal.</i>
- I don't believe it.

813
01:31:27,186 --> 01:31:29,272
You would have died.

814
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:35,111
My son was outside playing soccer.

815
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:40,324
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

816
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:46,998
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

817
01:31:47,206 --> 01:31:49,500
No.

818
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:53,254
All right.

819
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:58,467
- Are you sad or something?
- No. I'm nervous.

820
01:31:58,676 --> 01:32:04,724
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

821
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:22,241
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

822
01:32:24,327 --> 01:32:27,663
Let's get dressed.

823
01:32:34,962 --> 01:32:40,384
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

824
01:33:17,713 --> 01:33:20,424
All set?

825
01:33:24,804 --> 01:33:27,306
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

826
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:30,643
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

827
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:41,279
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

828
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,160
Good evening.

829
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,289
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking.

830
01:33:51,289 --> 01:33:55,251
- You can answer.
- Yes, we do.

831
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:59,213
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

832
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:02,758
They require a tie and jacket.

833
01:34:16,731 --> 01:34:23,613
No. I'm not putting that on. And I
won't let you inject me with plague.

834
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:28,826
It's a nice place. You dry-clean
these all the time, don't you?

835
01:34:29,243 --> 01:34:32,163
I don't think so.

836
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:45,510
You just wait here.

837
01:34:57,396 --> 01:34:59,065
Good evening.

838
01:35:00,942 --> 01:35:05,112
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

839
01:35:07,615 --> 01:35:11,577
- No?
- That one.

840
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:14,288
And this tie.

841
01:35:23,673 --> 01:35:25,341
Excuse me.

842
01:35:29,303 --> 01:35:33,891
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

843
01:35:34,725 --> 01:35:40,565
- Should I get her for you?
- No. I'll just watch.

844
01:36:24,775 --> 01:36:26,861
Ma'am ...

845
01:37:06,275 --> 01:37:08,778
You look so se ...

846
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,408
You look great.

847
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,745
You look great.

848
01:37:28,172 --> 01:37:30,675
You want to dance?

849
01:37:30,883 --> 01:37:34,846
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

850
01:37:35,263 --> 01:37:37,348
No.

851
01:37:39,851 --> 01:37:42,144
I don't get this place.

852
01:37:42,353 --> 01:37:48,818
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

853
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:55,283
What? Wait.
Where are you going? Why?

854
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:02,164
I didn't mean it that way. Sit down.

855
01:38:02,373 --> 01:38:07,587
- Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

856
01:38:08,004 --> 01:38:10,715
I need one. Quick.

857
01:38:10,923 --> 01:38:14,886
What you just said hurt my feelings.

858
01:38:15,094 --> 01:38:19,891
The minute someone gets that they
need you they threaten to walk out.

859
01:38:20,099 --> 01:38:24,687
A compliment is
something nice about somebody else.

860
01:38:25,104 --> 01:38:27,607
Now or never.

861
01:38:37,825 --> 01:38:40,953
And mean it.

862
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:54,509
Can we order first?

863
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:04,727
Two hard-shell crab dinners ...
Pitcher of cold beer.

864
01:39:04,936 --> 01:39:09,106
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

865
01:39:10,566 --> 01:39:14,111
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

866
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,699
I'll tell your waiter.

867
01:39:19,534 --> 01:39:26,415
I've got a great compliment for you.
And it's true.

868
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:33,923
- I'm afraid it's something awful.
- Don't be pessimistic.

869
01:39:34,131 --> 01:39:40,596
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

870
01:39:42,056 --> 01:39:46,435
I've got this ... ailment.

871
01:39:50,606 --> 01:39:54,360
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to, -

872
01:39:54,569 --> 01:40:00,408
- says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases a pill really helps.

873
01:40:01,033 --> 01:40:04,370
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing.

874
01:40:04,579 --> 01:40:09,375
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

875
01:40:09,584 --> 01:40:15,006
My compliment is, the night you came
over and told me you would never ...

876
01:40:17,508 --> 01:40:21,470
All right, you know what you said.

877
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,016
My compliment to you is, -

878
01:40:25,433 --> 01:40:30,229
- the next morning
I started taking the pills.

879
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:37,320
How is that a compliment for me?

880
01:40:42,116 --> 01:40:47,330
You make me
want to be a better man.

881
01:40:57,548 --> 01:41:01,719
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

882
01:41:06,098 --> 01:41:11,938
Maybe I overshot a bit
to keep you from walking out.

883
01:41:23,616 --> 01:41:29,247
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

884
01:41:35,086 --> 01:41:38,422
It's little by little.

885
01:41:39,257 --> 01:41:44,262
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

886
01:42:03,447 --> 01:42:08,452
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

887
01:42:08,661 --> 01:42:10,746
Never.

888
01:42:11,163 --> 01:42:14,292
Here's the trouble with never.

889
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:40,985
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

890
01:42:41,402 --> 01:42:47,033
When I first saw you
I thought you were handsome.

891
01:42:48,284 --> 01:42:51,412
Then, of course, you spoke.

892
01:42:53,289 --> 01:42:59,545
So now that your ...
soft underbelly is all exposed ...

893
01:43:00,379 --> 01:43:04,759
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

894
01:43:07,053 --> 01:43:08,721
Well, I ...

895
01:43:13,935 --> 01:43:19,357
- That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

896
01:43:19,565 --> 01:43:23,319
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

897
01:43:23,736 --> 01:43:28,533
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

898
01:43:30,201 --> 01:43:32,078
I ...

899
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:38,125
There's a lot of reasons.

900
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:45,007
- If you had sex with Simon ...
- What?

901
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:51,681
- That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

902
01:43:51,889 --> 01:43:56,269
Like I'm a what ..?
And I owe you what?

903
01:43:56,477 --> 01:44:01,065
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought.

904
01:44:01,274 --> 01:44:04,819
It came out first.

905
01:44:05,027 --> 01:44:09,198
You kiss him ... me ...
You two seemed to hit it off.

906
01:44:09,407 --> 01:44:13,995
Wait. I didn't mean ...
Forget what I said about Simon.

907
01:44:14,203 --> 01:44:17,957
- I'll never forget it.
- A mistake.

908
01:44:18,165 --> 01:44:20,668
It was a mistake.

909
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:30,678
<i>Hello, this is Fred Bishop.</i>
<i>We're unable to take your call.

910
01:44:30,887 --> 01:44:36,517
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
<i>- Say goodbye ... and thank you.

911
01:44:36,934 --> 01:44:39,854
It's Simon.

912
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:43,399
I'm in town.

913
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:53,618
You've never been out later than
ten o'clock. Pick up the phone.

914
01:44:55,703 --> 01:44:58,623
Really.

915
01:45:01,959 --> 01:45:06,547
I'm going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

916
01:45:06,756 --> 01:45:09,675
Or at least
get you to answer the phone.

917
01:45:18,851 --> 01:45:20,520
How are you?

918
01:45:21,354 --> 01:45:26,150
- Is this going to be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

919
01:45:26,984 --> 01:45:31,155
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

920
01:45:33,658 --> 01:45:38,037
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

921
01:45:41,165 --> 01:45:44,293
I'm taking a big bath.

922
01:45:44,502 --> 01:45:47,630
Are you okay?

923
01:45:48,047 --> 01:45:51,801
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my complaints.

924
01:45:52,009 --> 01:45:56,806
- What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

925
01:45:58,266 --> 01:46:03,271
Can you believe, in our little mix
you're the good roommate?

926
01:46:15,157 --> 01:46:17,451
Goodnight.

927
01:46:59,785 --> 01:47:03,748
Hold it.

928
01:47:22,516 --> 01:47:25,645
I have to draw you.

929
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:31,067
- I have to draw you.
- No.

930
01:47:31,275 --> 01:47:35,863
- I'm more shy than people think.
- I have to.

931
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:40,451
- I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

932
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:46,707
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

933
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:50,670
The back. The line of you.

934
01:47:52,129 --> 01:47:56,717
You're why cavemen
chiselled on walls.

935
01:47:58,803 --> 01:48:01,931
Cut me a break.

936
01:48:24,036 --> 01:48:27,790
The next thing I know
she's sitting next to me.

937
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:34,463
It's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

938
01:48:34,672 --> 01:48:38,009
I said the wrong thing.

939
01:48:40,928 --> 01:48:44,056
Where, if I hadn't, -

940
01:48:44,265 --> 01:48:48,019
- I could be in bed now
with a woman who ...

941
01:48:48,227 --> 01:48:52,398
If you make her laugh,
you got a life.

942
01:48:53,649 --> 01:48:56,569
Instead, I'm here with you.

943
01:48:56,569 --> 01:49:01,782
No offence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

944
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:08,247
Jameson, soda back.

945
01:49:09,916 --> 01:49:14,086
I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

946
01:49:14,295 --> 01:49:19,300
No, this is ...
This is great. This is so great.

947
01:49:19,508 --> 01:49:24,305
My hand won't even keep up.
Hold it.

948
01:49:24,305 --> 01:49:28,267
- I'm just turning.
- But hold that.

949
01:49:29,101 --> 01:49:32,647
My hand's not even bothering me.

950
01:49:34,732 --> 01:49:38,694
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

951
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:44,325
Careful.

952
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:52,458
PRIVACY

953
01:49:55,378 --> 01:49:59,131
I'm coming in. It's late.

954
01:50:04,762 --> 01:50:10,393
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

955
01:50:14,355 --> 01:50:16,232
Sorry.

956
01:50:17,483 --> 01:50:21,863
I didn't know she was still here ...
Did you have sex with her?

957
01:50:22,071 --> 01:50:26,659
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

958
01:50:27,702 --> 01:50:33,541
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

959
01:50:38,754 --> 01:50:41,674
I just love her.

960
01:50:46,888 --> 01:50:50,016
How are you doing?

961
01:51:04,614 --> 01:51:08,576
- Mom, hi.
<i>- Hello, Simon.

962
01:51:08,576 --> 01:51:12,330
<i>- You were right. We were home.</i>
- Do you have to whisper?

963
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:17,752
<i>- I'm not a screamer.</i>
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

964
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:21,923
<i>- Your father is not feeling well.</i>
- I can't hear you.

965
01:51:22,131 --> 01:51:25,259
<i>- Hold on.</i>
- What are you going to do?

966
01:51:25,885 --> 01:51:30,056
- I get why you're angry with me ...
- He's talking to his parents.

967
01:51:30,264 --> 01:51:34,852
Listen to me. Truly no grudges.

968
01:51:35,061 --> 01:51:39,857
It was odd that you didn't come and
see me when you heard I was hurt.

969
01:51:40,066 --> 01:51:42,777
<i>- We almost did.</i>
- I don't want to talk about it.

970
01:51:42,985 --> 01:51:47,573
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

971
01:51:47,573 --> 01:51:50,910
- I'm working again.
<i>- Good. About money ...

972
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:58,209
No. I'll drop you a line. It's up
to you to make the next move.

973
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:03,631
He's going to want to stay.
And they'll take a ride to the lake.

974
01:52:04,465 --> 01:52:09,262
- Bye-bye.
<i>- Goodbye, dear.

975
01:52:10,513 --> 01:52:15,309
We'll probably have a five-hour
drive. It'll give us a chance to ...

976
01:52:16,978 --> 01:52:20,523
- I'm coming.
- What about your parents?

977
01:52:20,731 --> 01:52:24,485
- No. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

978
01:52:24,694 --> 01:52:29,907
- You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

979
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:33,661
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

980
01:52:34,078 --> 01:52:37,623
Carol, a load has been lifted.

981
01:52:40,126 --> 01:52:43,462
- One night wih me.
- You think you're kidding.

982
01:52:47,425 --> 01:52:52,847
- No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

983
01:52:52,847 --> 01:52:56,809
Let me see ... Gorgeous.

984
01:52:57,643 --> 01:53:02,440
Do it. And get the dog picked up. I
can't believe he let it stay there.

985
01:53:02,648 --> 01:53:05,359
Goodbye.

986
01:53:05,568 --> 01:53:07,653
Your luck's running.

987
01:53:07,862 --> 01:53:13,075
They sub-let your place.
You're homeless.

988
01:53:13,284 --> 01:53:18,915
- Frank's got a line on a new place.
- Where?

989
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:23,085
Does it matter?

990
01:53:24,128 --> 01:53:27,256
No, it doesn't.

991
01:53:28,090 --> 01:53:31,219
I'm fine. Like the hat?

992
01:53:32,261 --> 01:53:34,138
I'm sorry.

993
01:53:49,153 --> 01:53:51,656
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY

994
01:54:06,879 --> 01:54:12,093
- I don't want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.

995
01:54:14,595 --> 01:54:20,851
- This one has a meaning.
- I don't want to hear it.

996
01:54:43,165 --> 01:54:47,336
Here's the keys to my apartment.

997
01:54:47,545 --> 01:54:51,716
Go up there and wait
and I'll take Carol home.

998
01:54:51,924 --> 01:54:56,512
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

999
01:55:01,934 --> 01:55:04,854
Can you come here?

1000
01:55:05,062 --> 01:55:08,816
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1001
01:55:09,025 --> 01:55:14,238
I don't want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.

1002
01:55:17,783 --> 01:55:20,703
You have my number.

1003
01:55:21,954 --> 01:55:26,125
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1004
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:30,504
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1005
01:55:38,846 --> 01:55:41,766
Don't say anything.

1006
01:55:45,311 --> 01:55:50,733
I've got to get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

1007
01:55:51,776 --> 01:55:55,321
I think you're going to
have to camp it here.

1008
01:55:55,529 --> 01:55:58,866
There's Verdell!

1009
01:56:06,999 --> 01:56:10,753
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1010
01:56:12,213 --> 01:56:16,384
Sorry. You're fun to mess with.

1011
01:56:17,635 --> 01:56:22,848
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

1012
01:56:23,057 --> 01:56:28,062
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

1013
01:56:28,062 --> 01:56:33,067
- It's got good light.
- I'm coming.

1014
01:56:38,072 --> 01:56:42,034
It's nice. Looks good.

1015
01:56:42,243 --> 01:56:49,959
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

1016
01:56:49,959 --> 01:56:52,461
I have to say they did a good job.

1017
01:56:55,381 --> 01:57:01,429
It's going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?

1018
01:57:06,225 --> 01:57:10,813
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

1019
01:57:18,112 --> 01:57:21,866
I love you.

1020
01:57:26,037 --> 01:57:32,710
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1021
01:57:44,805 --> 01:57:48,351
Make yourself at home.

1022
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:52,313
Anything else in the bag?

1023
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:56,275
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1024
01:57:56,484 --> 01:58:00,029
I love my cookbook.

1025
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:05,243
It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

1026
01:58:05,243 --> 01:58:10,665
Shark with a bite.
Would you like that, Spencer?

1027
01:58:10,665 --> 01:58:13,376
And some cookies here
called Wasps' Nests.

1028
01:58:16,921 --> 01:58:20,258
Where is my big hairy boy?

1029
01:58:20,466 --> 01:58:25,263
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

1030
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:27,765
Sweetheart!

1031
01:58:27,765 --> 01:58:31,310
- Oh, you're in bed.
- No, no.

1032
01:58:34,647 --> 01:58:41,946
I just didn't think Verdell should
get too comfortable sleeping here.

1033
01:58:42,154 --> 01:58:45,700
The dog's already comfortable.

1034
01:58:49,662 --> 01:58:51,747
Is this okay?

1035
01:58:53,624 --> 01:58:57,169
Hello ... Hi, it's me.

1036
01:58:57,587 --> 01:59:03,009
He took me in.
It's Carol for you.

1037
01:59:03,009 --> 01:59:08,014
- Jackie brought it all over ...
- Just take the dog.

1038
01:59:08,848 --> 01:59:10,933
Take the dog.

1039
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:19,692
- Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

1040
01:59:36,167 --> 01:59:39,295
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- Not so hot.

1041
01:59:39,503 --> 01:59:45,134
<i>- Why? What's wrong?</i>
- Was I sensible or hard on you?

1042
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:51,807
<i>- Maybe both.</i>
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

1043
01:59:52,016 --> 01:59:56,604
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer.

1044
01:59:56,812 --> 01:59:59,315
Just listen to me.

1045
01:59:59,941 --> 02:00:04,320
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1046
02:00:04,528 --> 02:00:10,159
And what I said on the street ...
That was a bad thing to say.

1047
02:00:10,368 --> 02:00:16,415
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1048
02:00:16,832 --> 02:00:21,629
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1049
02:00:23,089 --> 02:00:29,345
But you do bother me.
And I know it's better for me ...

1050
02:00:29,554 --> 02:00:34,141
... to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1051
02:00:34,350 --> 02:00:38,729
You're an old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

1052
02:00:38,938 --> 02:00:44,569
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1053
02:00:51,242 --> 02:00:54,370
Anyway. Thanks for the trip.

1054
02:00:56,038 --> 02:00:58,332
Goodnight.

1055
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:01,669
Okay if I say something now?

1056
02:01:05,631 --> 02:01:08,342
Go ahead.

1057
02:01:09,385 --> 02:01:13,556
I should have danced with you.

1058
02:01:16,475 --> 02:01:20,021
Goodnight.

1059
02:01:39,624 --> 02:01:44,212
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm coming.

1060
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:59,644
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1061
02:01:59,852 --> 02:02:04,023
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1062
02:02:05,274 --> 02:02:07,985
I'm dying here.

1063
02:02:09,445 --> 02:02:15,284
- Because ... you love her.
- No.

1064
02:02:15,493 --> 02:02:18,621
And you people
are supposed to be sensitive?

1065
02:02:18,829 --> 02:02:23,209
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here".

1066
02:02:23,417 --> 02:02:27,171
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1067
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:31,133
- I'll figure it out.
- Please ...

1068
02:02:32,593 --> 02:02:38,849
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1069
02:02:40,935 --> 02:02:45,940
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1070
02:02:46,148 --> 02:02:49,277
It's better than this.

1071
02:02:49,485 --> 02:02:53,864
If you're going to give me hope,
you've got to do better.

1072
02:02:54,073 --> 02:02:58,035
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut up.

1073
02:02:58,244 --> 02:03:02,206
I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

1074
02:03:02,415 --> 02:03:05,334
Picking on me won't help.

1075
02:03:06,586 --> 02:03:10,339
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1076
02:03:10,548 --> 02:03:14,719
Do you know where you're lucky?

1077
02:03:19,307 --> 02:03:23,060
You know who you want.

1078
02:03:23,269 --> 02:03:29,317
I would take your seat any day.
Do something. Go over there.

1079
02:03:29,525 --> 02:03:34,739
Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1080
02:03:34,947 --> 02:03:38,910
You can do this, Melvin.

1081
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:42,246
Tell her how you feel.

1082
02:03:42,455 --> 02:03:46,834
- I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1083
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:51,631
- She might kill me if I go there.
- Then stay. I'll read you a story.

1084
02:03:51,631 --> 02:03:57,470
The best thing going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself.

1085
02:03:57,678 --> 02:04:01,432
Go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1086
02:04:11,234 --> 02:04:13,945
Thanks a lot.

1087
02:04:15,613 --> 02:04:18,324
Here I go.

1088
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:30,211
What's wrong?

1089
02:04:31,879 --> 02:04:35,007
I forgot to lock the door.

1090
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:56,756
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1091
02:05:56,964 --> 02:06:00,301
I wasn't asleep.

1092
02:06:03,638 --> 02:06:06,557
What a break.

1093
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:11,354
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1094
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,567
I had to see you.

1095
02:06:19,695 --> 02:06:21,989
Because?

1096
02:06:24,283 --> 02:06:28,454
It relaxes me.

1097
02:06:28,871 --> 02:06:33,042
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb -

1098
02:06:33,251 --> 02:06:37,630
- than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1099
02:06:37,838 --> 02:06:40,341
That's overstating.

1100
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:46,389
I'd rather be sitting inside so l
don't get my feet in the gutter.

1101
02:06:46,597 --> 02:06:52,228
Stop. Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1102
02:06:52,228 --> 02:06:55,982
A regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1103
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:59,527
Everybody wants that.
It doesn't exist.

1104
02:07:03,281 --> 02:07:08,286
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1105
02:07:14,542 --> 02:07:17,670
Boyfriend ...

1106
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:25,803
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

1107
02:07:26,012 --> 02:07:30,182
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1108
02:07:33,519 --> 02:07:37,273
Maybe we could.

1109
02:08:02,298 --> 02:08:07,303
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

1110
02:08:10,223 --> 02:08:15,645
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1111
02:08:16,687 --> 02:08:21,692
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse ...

1112
02:08:22,526 --> 02:08:26,697
There's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

1113
02:08:26,906 --> 02:08:32,745
That way we're not screwy,
but two people that like warm rolls.

1114
02:08:57,144 --> 02:09:03,401
- What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.

1115
02:09:10,908 --> 02:09:15,705
<i>And darling</i>
<i>I'm never lonely

1116
02:09:15,913 --> 02:09:19,458
<i>whenever you're in sight...

1117
02:09:20,293 --> 02:09:22,169
Thank you.

1118
02:09:23,629 --> 02:09:26,966
I was ...

1119
02:09:40,938 --> 02:09:46,152
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is won't work.

1120
02:09:54,493 --> 02:09:56,996
- I'm ...
- What?

1121
02:09:59,081 --> 02:10:02,001
I'm feeling better.

1122
02:10:02,209 --> 02:10:09,091
It may seem that way now,
but you don't know me all that well.

1123
02:10:09,926 --> 02:10:12,845
I'm not the answer for you.

1124
02:10:13,054 --> 02:10:17,225
- I've got a compliment for you.
- You know what?

1125
02:10:17,433 --> 02:10:21,187
Let me talk.

1126
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:31,614
I might be the only person
on the earth -

1127
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:34,742
- that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

1128
02:10:34,951 --> 02:10:42,458
I might be the only one who knows
how amazing you are.

1129
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:47,046
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

1130
02:10:48,297 --> 02:10:52,468
And in every single thought
you have.

1131
02:10:52,677 --> 02:10:59,350
How you almost always mean something
that's about being straight or good.

1132
02:11:00,601 --> 02:11:04,564
Most people miss that about you.

1133
02:11:04,772 --> 02:11:09,986
I wonder how they can watch you
bring their food and clear tables -

1134
02:11:10,194 --> 02:11:14,365
- and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1135
02:11:14,574 --> 02:11:19,787
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good ...

1136
02:11:20,621 --> 02:11:25,001
... about me.

1137
02:11:31,257 --> 02:11:37,722
Is that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

1138
02:11:46,898 --> 02:11:49,400
No.

1139
02:11:52,111 --> 02:11:55,448
I'm going to grab you?

1140
02:11:55,656 --> 02:12:00,244
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

1141
02:12:23,809 --> 02:12:26,520
I know I can do better than that.

1142
02:12:50,086 --> 02:12:53,839
Better. Definitely better.

1143
02:12:58,010 --> 02:13:00,930
See?

1144
02:13:14,902 --> 02:13:19,699
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1145
02:13:28,249 --> 02:13:30,334
Excuse us.
