1
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,753
My bleeding feet!

2
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,792
Hello, Mrs. Joseph.

3
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,310
l like your hair.
ls that strawberry blonde?

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,158
You're only jealous.

5
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,076
What's for the old man's
supper tonight?

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,158
He'll be lucky to get
faggots and pease pudd, he will.

7
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,193
Well, he can't do much
on that, can he?

8
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,873
All l want him for
is to keep me feet warm.

9
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,912
Excuse me, dearie.

10
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,116
Here, Gert.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,393
l wouldn't mind having this little lot
in my stocking for Christmas.

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,638
What would you do with him?
You've been a widow too long.

13
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,199
You speak for yourself.

14
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,870
lt's like riding a bicycle.
You never forget how.

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,313
l'll tell you what l'll do.

16
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,558
l'll send my Alfie to you.
He's not bad once he gets going.

17
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,038
Well, l hope he's well-sprung.

18
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,670
Morning.

19
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,038
Looking for someone, mate?

20
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,832
Nice day, isn't it?

21
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,870
Sorry.

22
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,078
Hackman's in the staff room.

23
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,510
Where he bleeding well belongs.

24
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,150
Good morning.

25
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,149
My name is Thackeray.
l'm a new teacher.

26
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,319
We were expecting you.

27
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,832
So you're the new lamb
for the slaughter.

28
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,635
Or should l say...

29
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,069
...black sheep?

30
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,636
No, just a teacher, Mr. Hackman.

31
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,549
l'm not Hackman.
Perish the thought.

32
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,391
He's departed,
God rest his soul.

33
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,430
He's probably pouring out his woes
to the divisional officer by now.

34
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,269
Weston.

35
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,079
l'm Mrs. Evans, Grace.
Deputy head.

36
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,395
Mrs. Evans.

37
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,318
Have you seen any children yet?

38
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,398
l looked in on Mr. Hackman's class
for a moment.

39
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,391
l take them for domestic science.

40
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,069
Like a cup of tea?

41
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,555
No, thank you, not just now.

42
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,953
You been teaching long?

43
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,237
This is my first appointment.

44
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,752
We call them jobs.

45
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,075
American, are you?

46
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,316
British, from British Guiana.

47
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,477
But l spent some years
in the States.

48
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,274
-Where?
-ln California.

49
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,472
Weather as good as they say?

50
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,034
lt's better.

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,230
What was your subject?

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,197
What did you major in?

53
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,038
Engineering.

54
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,309
l must be off.
Make yourself at home.

55
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,556
Wander around, if you like,
or stay here.

56
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,637
l'll introduce you at lunch.

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,069
Thank you.

58
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,428
This is Gillian, Mr. Thackeray.

59
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,714
Gillian Blanchard.

60
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,911
She's new here too.
Came the day before yesterday.

61
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,118
-Tea, Gillian?
-Thank you.

62
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
This is Mr. Mark Thackeray,
the new replacement.

63
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,876
Jose Dawes,
Euphemia Phillips.

64
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,832
They teach the little ones.

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,348
Theo Weston, you know.

66
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,234
l've had the pleasure.
He mistook me for Hackman.

67
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,238
-He's fled.
-l don't blame him.

68
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,351
That's enough to destroy anybody.

69
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,232
He got what he deserved.

70
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,988
l'm Clinty Clintridge.

71
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,759
Clinty's a marvelous artist.

72
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,634
Got one at the Royal Academy
a couple of years ago.

73
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,592
Teaching provides the bread and butter.

74
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,678
Well, that's all the staff
except for Mr. Bell...

75
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,473
...our P.T. instructor.

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,591
l hope you're
going to stay with us.

77
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,229
l shouldn't if l were you, old man.

78
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,192
Row home while you can.

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,112
Don't discourage him, Weston.

80
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,918
Well, l must go.

81
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,839
l have to fix a bath
for a girl in Clinty's class.

82
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,950
Why?

83
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,276
Kids complained again.
Won't sit near her.

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,549
What's the matter?

85
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,558
Personal hygiene problems.

86
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,478
Fourteen and helpless.

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,599
You men are lucky.

88
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,152
The things we women have to do
for these kids.

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,635
Gillian, dear...

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,513
...encourage him to stay.

91
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,634
Why is it everyone thinks
l need encouraging?

92
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,638
They said the same to me.

93
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,153
There's something frightening but
also challenging about this school.

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,671
There's no form of corporal
punishment or any punishment.

95
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,995
None?

96
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,794
l have no real teaching experience.
l'm lost.

97
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,911
l don't have any experience either.

98
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,477
But it'll be much easier for you.

99
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,277
l'm a little afraid of them.

100
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,314
Midday dance session.

101
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,070
At lunch, the older kids use the hall.
l sometimes join them.

102
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,918
Even the old man shakes a leg.

103
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,668
Dancing is merely their way
of keeping fit...

104
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,316
...for the more exciting pastime
of teacher baiting.

105
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,636
Couldn't you be
a bit less discouraging?

106
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,070
lt's the last thing l want to do.

107
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,759
The music's louder than usual.

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,873
They're probably celebrating
victory over Hackman.

109
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,556
l better go and see Mr. Florian.

110
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,319
l'll show you the way.

111
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,795
-They're good, aren't they?
-l suppose so.

112
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,953
The head's study is this way.

113
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,155
Do you two....

114
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,435
Do you two shake?

115
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,954
Well, l'll see you later,
Mr. Thackeray.

116
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,355
Well?

117
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,396
Thank you.

118
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,875
But l have to go
and see the principal.

119
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,630
You have excellent qualifications,
astonishing ones, in fact...

120
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,672
...as a communications engineer.

121
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,554
Field experience in South America....

122
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,678
Why do you want to be a teacher?

123
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,950
Reasons.

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,629
You've already tried to get
an engineering post?

125
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,036
l tried for 1 8 months, sir.

126
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,275
We have no blueprint in North Quay.

127
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,996
Most of our children are
rejects from other schools.

128
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,475
We must help and teach them
as best we can...

129
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,318
...and as much as we can.

130
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,319
The local authorities are not
totally on our side.

131
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,434
And if you accept this position,
you'll be entirely on your own.

132
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,917
l and the staff will do
everything we can to help you...

133
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,317
...but success or failure
will depend entirely upon you.

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,756
What's it to be?

135
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,348
l want the job, sir.

136
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,670
Good.

137
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,149
Then it's settled.

138
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,668
Tomorrow, you'll take over
Hackman's class.

139
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,315
Sapiano.

140
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,149
Wong.

141
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,675
Osgood.

142
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,470
Tuffen.

143
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,356
Pegg.

144
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,276
Pegg?

145
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,635
Joseph.

146
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,629
Dare.

147
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,156
Potter.

148
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,996
Potter.

149
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,710
Denham.

150
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,836
Buckley.

151
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,069
Purcell.

152
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,275
Fernman.

153
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,190
Jackson.

154
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,834
Strong.

155
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,229
Seales.

156
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,836
-Palmer.
-Yes, Guvnor.

157
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,749
Campbell.

158
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,836
Present.

159
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,832
l don't know how much you know,
so we'll start from scratch.

160
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,798
First, as l call your name...

161
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,629
...will you read anything you like
from one of your schoolbooks?

162
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,555
Fernman.

163
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,275
Right.

164
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,073
''Only those who...

165
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,958
...arrived on...

166
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,993
...horseback...

167
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,195
-...or in a public coach.''
-Thank you.

168
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,510
Denham.

169
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,870
'' lf 1 4 hens lay an egg
a day for 30 days...

170
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,119
...how much are the eggs a dozen,
and how many have you to sell?''

171
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,956
Moira Joseph.

172
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,630
'' Pete Gilroy's weight
and the ever-tightening noose...

173
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,433
...about her neck...

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,390
...began slightly to impede
the wild mare's speed.

175
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,310
But Pete was only too fully aware
of what his fate would be...

176
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
...for he could not hope
to escape death...

177
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,110
...from being battered and crushed.''

178
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,871
Put that away, please.

179
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,510
Thank you.

180
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,152
Would anyone else like to read?

181
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,596
-Your name, please.
-Pamela Dare.

182
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,072
''And he had learned to love.

183
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,429
l know not why...

184
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,393
...for this in such as him
seemed strange of mood.

185
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,154
But thus it was.

186
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,471
And though
in solitude's small part...

187
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,149
...the nipped affections
have to grow.

188
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,999
ln him this glowed...

189
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,953
...when all beside
had ceased to glow.''

190
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,474
Thank you, Miss Dare.

191
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,876
Next, weights and measures.

192
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,834
What's avoirdupois?

193
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,917
-Avoir de what?
-Avoirdupois.

194
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,355
Weights.

195
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,069
Heavyweight, light-heavy,
cruiserweight...

196
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
...middle, light, bantam,
fly, featherweight.

197
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,157
Thank you very much.

198
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,193
lt's encouraging that
you have a sense of humour.

199
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,272
lt seems you know so little
and are easily amused...

200
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,391
...l can look forward to a happy time.

201
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,030
Copy down the following tables.

202
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,038
Who does he think he is, there?

203
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,514
The cheeky devil.

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,274
Hello, ducks.

205
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,757
Thought you might need this.

206
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,228
How'd it go?

207
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,514
Let's just say, battle was joined.

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,069
l don't know what we'd do
without a cuppa.

209
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,588
What's your name?

210
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,071
l know that.
l mean, your other name.

211
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,429
Mark.

212
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,238
Couple of things, Mark.

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,991
We all know the old man's views.

214
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,316
Basically, we agree with them.

215
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,830
But he's safe in an office.

216
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,916
These kids come from homes where
an order is accompanied by a blow.

217
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,317
One rude word to their parents,
the roof will hit them.

218
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,634
There's nothing like that
going on here, right?

219
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,797
So they've got us
at a great disadvantage.

220
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,512
Hackman tried to be popular.
He hung himself.

221
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,472
Weston couldn't care less
about them, and that's no good.

222
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,830
l can't guide you...

223
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,477
...but don't take any nonsense
from these little tykes.

224
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,070
They're good kids, Mark,
most of them.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,039
But if you don't solve them,
they'll break you and damn quickly.

226
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,594
That's been tried...

227
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,949
...by experts.

228
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,351
They're very expert.

229
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,196
Please can l leave the room, Guv?

230
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,795
Yes. And it's ''Thackeray.''

231
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,555
Yes, Guv.

232
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,070
Most of you girls help your mothers
with the shopping.

233
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,353
So sorry, Mr. Thackeray.

234
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,115
Proper drafty in these parts,
isn't it?

235
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,829
About multiplying...

236
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,274
...there are a few
valuable tricks to know.

237
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,718
Say that you're offered roast beef
at seven shillings per pound.

238
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,270
Potter.

239
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,316
Must you do that?

240
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,035
l can't help it, Sir.
lt's me desk.

241
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,429
Poor old Potts!

242
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,150
Sit down.

243
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,033
l'll speak with the caretaker
about it after school.

244
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,235
lsn't he nice?

245
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,510
l hope l didn't miss nothing.

246
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,916
Where was we?
About shopping or some--?

247
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,031
That's enough, Denham.

248
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,835
l was only asking, Mr. Thackeray.
l don't wanna miss nothing.

249
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,039
Bert, he was just about to show us
a new and valuable trick.

250
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,750
-When you're shopping, you see--
-l said, that's enough.

251
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,470
Sit down.

252
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,713
Do exercise four, five and six.

253
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,398
Very quietly.

254
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,070
Don't worry.
The worst is still to come.

255
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,834
You're still getting
the silent treatment.

256
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,792
What's the next phase?

257
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,552
Well, unless you can work up
a little black magic...

258
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,430
...these little bastards have
a multitude of tricks.

259
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,358
Why did you take up teaching?

260
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,709
lt's good to have some kind of a job.

261
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,312
But l'm teaching them nothing.
l'm not even getting to first base.

262
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,628
Don't worry,
your lot leaves this term.

263
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,154
The next will be better.

264
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,550
They'll be just as bad.
Probably worse.

265
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,515
What's your answer?

266
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,789
What they need...

267
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,515
...is a bloody good hiding.

268
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,192
l feel rather sorry for them,
you know?

269
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,672
Most of them can hardly read.

270
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,438
You're so naive,
my dear old colleague.

271
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,631
They'll be earning twice as much
as us before you can shake a stick.

272
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,799
They'll happily be part
of the great London unwashed:

273
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,910
llliterate...

274
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,039
...smelly...

275
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,117
...and quite content.

276
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,793
An education's a disadvantage
in this day and age.

277
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,432
That is ridiculous!

278
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,073
But still true.

279
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,270
So you'd better start
brushing up...

280
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,233
...on your voodoo if you wish
to remain sane.

281
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,036
Good morning.

282
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,711
All right, take your seats.

283
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,080
-All right, Sir?
-l hope you didn't hurt yourself.

284
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,070
You all right?

285
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,352
Cheap stuff they're selling nowadays.

286
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,828
Want me to help, Sir?

287
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,829
Sit down.

288
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,997
Take your proper places.

289
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,953
We can move around here,
you know, Sir.

290
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,034
Take your proper places.

291
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,078
Beg your pardon.

292
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,474
Something the matter?

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,636
Seales, is something wrong?

294
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,715
lt's me mum.
She's awful sick.

295
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,993
l'm sorry.

296
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,034
Anything l can do?

297
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,830
Nothing.

298
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,240
-She's English.
-l see.

299
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,473
You're like my old man,
except bigger and younger.

300
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,829
Rotten bastard!

301
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,792
You shouldn't speak like that.

302
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,719
You know nothing.
l hate him!

303
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,115
Why not?

304
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,392
Never forgive him for
what he did to me mum. Never!

305
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,315
He married her, didn't he?
Didn't he?!

306
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,872
Today, let's take a look
at South America.

307
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,756
l'm sorry, Mr. Fackeray.
The bloody things just slipped.

308
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,955
The name is Thackeray,
and they are not '' bloody things.''

309
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,515
They were a pile of books.

310
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,632
That's a good netting score.

311
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,152
Pam, luv, that's not a bloody pile,
but it's a pile of books.

312
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,509
All right, settle down.

313
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,399
l was only trying to help,
Mr. Thackeray, Sir.

314
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,033
That's right, Mr. Thackeray.

315
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,869
Curley was only trying to put
that little scrubber in her place.

316
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,156
l know what Curley was trying to do.
Now, just settle down.

317
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,711
We are going to study
South America.

318
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,598
Now turn to page 37
in your geography book.

319
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,949
''They were alone...

320
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,915
...but not alone as they who
shut in chambers think it loneliness.

321
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,556
The voiceless sand and the drooping
caves that lay around them...

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,790
...made them to each other press as if
there were no life beneath the sky....''

323
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,393
Sorry, luv.
lt's the bleeding desk.

324
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,392
You speak such words
to your father?

325
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,596
You're not my bleeding father!

326
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,439
All l want to know is,
who does he think he is?

327
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,758
Mate, shut up!

328
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,630
Morning.

329
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,109
Hello, Thackeray.
How goes it?

330
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,074
Fine, thank you, sir.

331
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,918
All you boys, out!

332
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,598
The girls stay where they are.

333
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,989
What's the matter?

334
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,753
Out!
Out at once!

335
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,109
All right.

336
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,520
l am sick of your foul language...

337
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,997
...your crude behaviour
and your sluttish manner.

338
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,350
A decent woman keeps
some things private.

339
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,915
Only a filthy slut
would have done this!

340
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,031
Those who encouraged her
are bad too!

341
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,073
l don't care who's responsible!
You're all to blame!

342
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,635
l'm leaving for five minutes,
by which time...

343
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,269
...that disgusting object
had better be removed!

344
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,551
And open the windows
to clear the stench!

345
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,509
lf you must play these filthy games,
do them in your homes...

346
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,833
...and not in my classroom!

347
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,236
What's the matter?

348
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,873
Man, oh, man!

349
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,197
l lost my temper. The one thing
l swore l would never do.

350
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,152
God, did l lose my temper!

351
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,190
What happened?

352
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,715
After all the bull
l've taken in my life...

353
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,192
...in a few short weeks,
those kids have got me so steamed up...

354
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,313
...so easy, so quickly.

355
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,352
l never would have thought it.

356
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,275
-Perhaps you're trying too hard.
-Those kids are devils incarnate.

357
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,677
l tried everything. Everything!
But nothing l tried--

358
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,315
Kids.

359
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,035
Kids.

360
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,389
That's it!

361
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,239
Those are out.

362
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,032
They are useless to you.

363
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,158
l realized you are not children.

364
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,399
You will be adults in a few weeks,
with all the responsibilities.

365
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,355
From now on, you will be treated
as such by me and by each other...

366
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,996
...as adults.
Responsible adults.

367
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,397
Next, we'll be reasonable
with each other.

368
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,069
We are just going to talk,
you and l.

369
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,511
You will listen
without interruption.

370
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,509
And when l am finished,
one of you may have your say...

371
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,472
...without interruptions.

372
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,715
Next--

373
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,714
What a morning!
Everything's gone wrong.

374
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,117
The alarm didn't go off.
Then l had to wait hours for a bus.

375
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,595
l must've stood there
three bleeding hours--

376
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,869
Example:

377
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,751
There are two ways to enter a room.

378
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,315
One is like an adult,
a lady with dignity.

379
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,993
The other is like a brat.

380
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,918
Miss Dare's shown the second way.
Perhaps you'd demonstrate the first?

381
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,278
l'm sorry l'm late.

382
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,510
Next...

383
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,759
...we are all going to observe
certain courtesies in this classroom.

384
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,111
You will call me
Sir or Mr. Thackeray.

385
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,994
The young ladies will be
addressed as Miss...

386
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,793
...the boys by their surnames.

387
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,514
Why should we call them Miss?
We know them.

388
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,074
l beg your pardon?

389
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,635
l said, why should we
call them Miss, Sir?

390
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,955
We know them.

391
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,151
ls there a young lady you feel...

392
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,079
...does not deserve to be
addressed as Miss?

393
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,753
-No, Sir.
-Good.

394
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,596
Next, general deportment.

395
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,592
First, the young ladies.

396
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,595
They must prove worthy of
the courtesies we'll show them.

397
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,831
Soon boyfriends and marriage
will concern you.

398
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,548
No man likes a slut for long.

399
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,400
Only the worst type will marry one.

400
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,274
And the competition for men
on the outside is rough.

401
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,679
Next, men.

402
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,872
l've seen garbage collectors
who are cleaner.

403
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,551
Toughness is a quality
of the mind...

404
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,354
...like bravery,
honesty and ambition.

405
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,909
lf you want to wear your hair long,
clean it...

406
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
...else you'll soon get lice and smell.

407
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,949
Soon your principle interest
will be girls.

408
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,317
You will be more attractive
with clean clothes, shoes...

409
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,915
...hands, face, teeth, et cetera.

410
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,914
Any questions?

411
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,356
Miss Pegg.

412
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,558
What about Mr. Weston, Sir?

413
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,628
He's never tidy, his shoes is
never brushed and his hair's a mess.

414
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,670
lt's filthy.

415
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,433
Mr. Weston is not your teacher.
We won't discuss him.

416
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,596
l'm the one to criticize
if l fail to maintain the standards.

417
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,875
That's not fair.

418
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,790
Sir...

419
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,028
...or Mr. Thackeray.
Didn't you understand?

420
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,999
That's not fair...

421
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,195
...Sir.

422
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,950
l agree.

423
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,479
But it's an example of things
you'll have to put up with as an adult.

424
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,712
You'll just have to take it.

425
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,270
Next, we are going to talk
about various--

426
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,317
Good morning.

427
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,353
-l wanted to see how you were doing.
-Fine, thank you.

428
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,390
Good.

429
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,429
Thank you.

430
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,469
What is it?

431
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,555
Palmer?

432
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,550
What are we gonna talk about, Sir?

433
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,869
About life...

434
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,235
...survival...

435
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,195
...love...

436
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,233
...death, sex, marriage...

437
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,432
...rebellion, anything you want.

438
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,115
l never did see one like him, Pam.

439
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,597
Even when he blew his stack,
no swearing or nothing.

440
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,630
Blimey!

441
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,390
Ain't natural, that's what.
Does he really mean what he says?

442
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,556
l don't know.

443
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,753
lt'd be a change, though, to see
those creeps acting like gents.

444
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,751
Here, which one do you fancy?

445
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,235
l like Babs.

446
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,399
Yeah? Watch this.

447
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,800
-Come on, Pam, luv.
-Get lost, Denham!

448
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,510
l don't like
your smelly tricks, do l?

449
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,631
And it's Miss Dare to you.

450
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,834
Get stuffed.

451
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,469
Come on then, luv.

452
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,273
You heard what Sir said,
Mr. Smarty Denham.

453
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,158
lf you want to dance with me,
you bleeding well ask proper.

454
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,039
May l have the pleasure
of this dance, Miss Pegg?

455
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,548
Blimey!
Good old Potts.

456
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,750
Get you, Potter.

457
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,070
Shut up!

458
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,834
Who does he think he is,
bleeding Fred Astaire?

459
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,668
Come on, Miss Pegg.

460
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,917
Look at me.
l am a lady, l am.

461
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,833
Rotten tarts, all of them.

462
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,031
Chimney sweep was right about that.

463
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,675
He won't catch me
spending me nicker on them.

464
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,350
He said we could talk about anything.

465
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,272
You are so right, Tich, mate.

466
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,590
He did say
we could ask him anything.

467
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,313
Questions and answers.

468
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,033
Last night on the telly,
there was this travelogue picture.

469
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,517
You know, a lot of black women
dancing around with no tops.

470
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,475
Don't they ever dress proper?

471
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,990
What's proper varies
throughout the world...

472
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,111
...depending on
customs and climate.

473
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,955
For their climate and customs,
they were dressed properly.

474
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,593
Are you from South Africa?

475
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,917
Of course not.
South Africans is white, isn't they?

476
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,149
A South African is a native
of South Africa, regardless of colour.

477
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,396
l was born in British Guiana.

478
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,949
What did you mean the other day
about rebellion, Sir?

479
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,755
Change.

480
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,155
Take your hairstyles.
That's a form of rebellion, isn't it?

481
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,430
What, Sir?

482
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,632
Don't you do it
to be different from adults?

483
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,990
They've messed up the world,
haven't they?

484
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,589
-You can say that again.
-So you rebel.

485
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,112
Even the way you dress is
a form of rebellion, isn't it?

486
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,072
lt's just the new fashion, Sir.

487
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,796
Of course, the adults look
proper stupid in our gear.

488
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,117
Do you think it's wrong
to be different, to rebel?

489
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,592
lt is your duty to change
the world, if you can.

490
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,234
Not by violence.

491
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,432
Peacefully, individually,
not as a mob.

492
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,832
Take the Beatles.
They started a huge social revolution.

493
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,112
The fashions they set in dress...

494
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,789
...and hairstyles are worldwide now.

495
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,678
Every new fashion...

496
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,229
...is a form of rebellion.

497
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,994
There's an exhibit
of costumes through the ages...

498
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,196
...at the Victoria
and Albert Museum.

499
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,153
l think you should see it.

500
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,398
Also, you should see
the Museum of Natural History.

501
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,910
What, us lot go to a museum?

502
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,235
-Sure.
-You're joking.

503
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,593
You'll discover that
your hairstyles are 200 years old...

504
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,196
...and that your costumes
or your dress...

505
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,152
...is right out of 1 920.

506
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,312
Shut up!
Look, Sir, when can we go?

507
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,115
There's no time after school,
and l've got to look after the kids.

508
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,710
l have to do the housework
and get the supper for the lodgers.

509
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,356
Me mum's expecting a baby any day,
and l got to babysit.

510
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,512
Why don't you take us?
We could go in the morning.

511
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,675
Who would like that?

512
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,075
What a drag!

513
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,874
Don't you want a day off?
Put your hand up.

514
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,314
-Put both hands up.
-Fat chance!

515
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,628
lt wouldn't work.

516
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,317
lt's not the sort of risk
we'd dare to take at North Quay.

517
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,919
l would like to try, Sir.

518
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,113
The best of pupils are inclined
to show off in public.

519
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,710
Your class?

520
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,155
You'd never be able
to supervise them.

521
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,277
When l took this job,
you said you wouldn't interfere...

522
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,120
...as long as l stayed
within your framework.

523
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,879
lf you can get another
staff member to go with you...

524
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,957
...l'll approach the council.

525
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,311
l see little hope of approval.

526
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,949
Thank you, Sir.

527
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,950
Miss Blanchard, l think l can
arrange an outing with my class...

528
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,470
...if l can get
another teacher to go along.

529
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,478
l'd love to.
And it's Gillian.

530
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,829
When is the outing?

531
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,315
When we get travel warrants
and permission.

532
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,033
Just let me know when.

533
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,390
Thanks, Gillian. Bye.

534
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,515
Good morning.

535
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,633
What would you like
to talk about today?

536
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,594
Ladies first.

537
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,550
Miss Joseph.

538
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,479
Marriage, Sir.
You know, boyfriends and things.

539
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,479
How do you know he's the right one?
What to look for.

540
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,273
How to avoid divorce.

541
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,039
Don't get married.

542
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,154
Where's Miss Purcell?

543
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,955
She's to look after the home.
Her mum had the baby last night.

544
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,309
What hospital?

545
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,514
No hospital, Sir.
The doctor came to her.

546
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,510
She all right?

547
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,916
Well, she just had a kid.
Didn't she?

548
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,110
Now, marriage.

549
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,715
First, let us lay some ground rules.

550
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,151
l've never been married,
so what l say is as an outsider.

551
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,556
Now, what should a girl
look for in a man?

552
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,150
l think first we ought
to determine what is marriage.

553
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,030
Miss Joseph.

554
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,358
Holy wedlock.

555
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,109
Potter, be serious.
You'll get your turn.

556
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,789
Miss Pegg.

557
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,274
lt's life, isn't it, Sir?

558
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,711
Everyone gets married.
l mean, sometime.

559
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,910
Why didn't you?

560
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,514
No one would have him.

561
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,915
l was very poor.

562
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,677
There was something in me
that wanted an education...

563
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,030
...so l put all of
my energies into that.

564
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,835
Well, l got started later.
Just never met the right girl.

565
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,517
What should a girl
look for in a man?

566
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,835
-Miss Clark?
-What work did you do, Sir?

567
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,556
l waited tables.
l cooked in a hamburger joint.

568
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,070
l washed dishes for a time, cars.

569
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,319
For a year l was a janitor
in an apartment block.

570
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,352
-Lots of jobs.
-You washed dishes?

571
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,350
l did.

572
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,789
But you talk posh.

573
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,197
-That wasn't easy.
-You didn't always talk like that?

574
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,155
When l was your age, l used a patois,
a kind of simple English.

575
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,677
l going bust your booby
if you don't get up off of this--

576
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,319
l didn't understand a word.

577
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,558
Well, l don't always understand
what you say either.

578
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,718
lf you work hard,
you can do almost anything.

579
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,594
You can get any job you want.
You can even--

580
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,875
You can even change your speech
if you want to.

581
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,193
After l got my degree, l worked
in South America for an oil company.

582
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,357
The only women in that region...

583
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,235
...were jungle lndians who carried
blowpipes and poison darts.

584
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,116
You could have broke my hands.

585
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,798
We were discussing marriage.

586
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,990
To my mind, marriage is
no way of life for the weak...

587
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,349
...the selfish...

588
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,074
...or the insecure.

589
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,193
What's the matter, Weston?

590
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,118
These damn fool Americans!

591
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,994
They bog up everything
they're connected with.

592
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,554
What a shower!

593
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,075
l'll never forgive the President
for missing Churchill's funeral...

594
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,999
...nor sending the vice president.
Rotten manners.

595
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,555
-lt was very naughty.
-l quite agree.

596
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,389
A typically stupid, appalling
and unnecessary mistake.

597
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,070
-What can you expect?
-Still beefing?

598
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,352
Give them a chance.
They've not been leading the world...

599
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,033
...as long as Britain has.

600
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,880
You continue to astonish me,
old chum.

601
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,830
l should've thought
if anyone took a point--

602
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,235
Now what?

603
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,314
Miss Pegg wants to know
if the netball's fixed.

604
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,794
Miss who?

605
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,832
Barbara Pegg.
Miss Pegg, Sir.

606
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,553
Here you are, Fernman.

607
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,075
Thank you, Sir.

608
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,309
What's going on in
this classroom of yours?

609
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,309
Suburban formality? lt's a bit
foreign in this neck of the woods.

610
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,672
Some sort of experiment
in culture for the masses?

611
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,349
lt's an elementary
experiment in courtesy.

612
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,598
And do we ignorant critters
have to follow suit?

613
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,038
-Please yourself.
-Thank goodness for that!

614
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,039
Do you object to being
taught manners by the boys?

615
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,470
l won't to be taught
by those morons.

616
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,479
So long as we learn,
it doesn't matter who teaches us.

617
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,557
Good afternoon, everybody.

618
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,629
Now we're talking.

619
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,919
Nothing like payday.

620
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,795
By the way, your museum visit
has been approved.

621
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,116
lf things go wrong,
the school suffers.

622
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,038
Nothing will go wrong, Sir.

623
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,113
For a moment, l thought
l was in the wrong classroom.

624
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,235
Where's Jackson?

625
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,556
We don't know.

626
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,355
Tich wouldn't miss this
unless he was sick or something.

627
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,278
We'll give him a few minutes.

628
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,470
lt's me, Jackson.

629
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,195
l have to take the wash for mum.
Can you wait?

630
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,710
Sure.
How long will it take?

631
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,274
Half a mo.
Just up the frog.

632
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,356
God love you.

633
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,675
Hang on, Tich.
l'll give you a hand.

634
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,953
All right.

635
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,832
Back on the sidewalk.

636
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,715
What's a frog got to do with it?

637
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,275
lt's rhyming slang.
Old-fashioned cockney.

638
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,431
lt's only used by old people now.

639
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,755
lt's a drag, Sir.

640
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,036
Frog means road.
Frog and toad, road.

641
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,270
Trouble, strife, wife.

642
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,516
Weeping willow, pillow.
The first word.

643
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,836
Like the old currant bun,
that's the sun.

644
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,390
-Apples and pears, stairs.
-Happy kill, skill.

645
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,754
Ginger beer, queer.

646
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,789
All aboard.

647
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,151
l think he fancies her.

648
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,793
l know you do.

649
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,433
Pamela has a crush on you.

650
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,478
Women say the damnedest things.

651
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,313
l think he's nice.

652
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,069
So do l.

653
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,349
You've noticed.

654
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,557
l treat her as l do
the other girls.

655
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,836
l hope we can go out again,
don't you?

656
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,870
l hope so.

657
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,395
l hope we can go with him,
because he's nice.

658
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,119
Don't be mistaken...

659
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,960
...Pamela's a woman
in every sense of the word.

660
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,796
l mean...

661
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,672
...not that l blame her.

662
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,516
Bleeding rotten taste he's got.

663
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,074
Good night, Sir.

664
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,275
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

665
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,911
Perhaps l could tidy your desk.

666
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,794
-That's all right.
-lt's no trouble.

667
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,311
You should get a flat nearby.
Brentwood's much too far away.

668
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,875
-There's nice ones around.
-l've thought of it.

669
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,879
l tell you what.
l'll keep my ears open for you.

670
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,670
That's kind of you,
but l'm fine.

671
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,837
l'll let you know.
Thank you.

672
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,711
Don't worry about your desk.
l'll tidy it for you every day.

673
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,514
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

674
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,233
That's perfectly all right.

675
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,397
A woman's work is never done.

676
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,355
Good night, Sir.

677
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,632
Hi, fellas. How are you?

678
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,199
Good morning, Sir.

679
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,117
Mr. Florian has given us
permission for more outings.

680
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,120
l'd like to hear suggestions
of what we might do.

681
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,072
-The pictures.
-Wembley, Sir.

682
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,549
Cup Final Day.

683
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,829
Chamber of Horrors.

684
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,439
What about the Cavern?

685
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,398
You know, Liverpool.
The Beatles.

686
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,430
How's it going?

687
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,319
Fine, thank you.

688
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,431
He'll come with me on my day.

689
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,792
-You're under a supervision order too?
-That's nothing, Sir.

690
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,718
Most of us have broken the law.

691
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,152
Breaking windows, truancy,
raising hell and cussing the coppers.

692
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,673
You've cut yourself.

693
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,713
You'd better put something on that.
You'll get lockjaw.

694
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,228
Blimey!
Red blood.

695
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,316
What do you expect, pinhead?
lnk?

696
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,436
l didn't mean no harm.
lt was a joke.

697
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,199
l didn't mean no crack, Sir.

698
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,469
lt's all right.

699
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,310
What's with you?

700
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,870
Are you addressing me, Denham?

701
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,434
Potts was only being funny.

702
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,349
What you calling him pinhead for
in front of chimney sweep?

703
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,790
l was only joking.
Sir didn't mind.

704
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,195
He said, ask anything.

705
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,438
You call those questions?
Always on about his colour.

706
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,315
You're wasting our time.
Seales, you ought to know better.

707
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,552
What've l done?
l said nothing.

708
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,876
You never do,
and you're half-coloured.

709
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,913
You quietly sit on your ass.

710
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,355
lf they wanna know,
why don't they ask you?

711
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,711
l'm not Sir, that's why.

712
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,398
l only wish l was.

713
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,313
l know what's eating you.

714
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,716
You fancy him, that's what.

715
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,709
This is a fine how-do-you-do,
isn't it, Potts?

716
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,150
You lay off, Denham,
you son of a bitch.

717
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,916
Today, l'm gonna show you
how to make salad.

718
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,191
You mean we've to cook and all?

719
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,434
Sure, why not?

720
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,631
My old man never cooked in his life.

721
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,310
He says that's women's work,
the kitchen and all.

722
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,113
But suppose you're on your own,
as you certainly will be shortly.

723
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,517
You'll have to do it for yourself
sometimes, won't you?

724
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,357
Not again, Sir.

725
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,956
This is survival training.

726
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,673
A normal English salad...

727
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,589
...not fit for human consumption,
even if you remove the slugs...

728
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,509
...and add a dash of the extraordinary,
a bit of mayonnaise.

729
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,439
Look at this.

730
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,114
Sorry l'm late.

731
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,874
Mum's at the doctor.
l didn't want to miss today.

732
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,036
He won't be trouble.

733
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,039
lt's all right.

734
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,475
Sit down.
Make room over there for her.

735
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,509
Okay, come on.

736
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,318
Never be afraid to experiment.

737
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,716
And remember that you can eat well...

738
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,592
...even though you're broke.
See?

739
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,190
You ever been broke, Sir?
Real broke, skint?

740
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,515
Many, many times.

741
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,711
l don't understand you a bit, Sir.

742
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,750
l mean...

743
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,911
...you're a toff and you ain't.

744
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,673
What he means is....

745
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,399
Blimey, l can't sort of put it
into words or anything.

746
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,476
Well, Sir...

747
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,275
...you're like us, but you ain't.
l mean, you're not.

748
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,676
lt's kind of scary but nice.

749
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,678
You know what l mean, don't you?

750
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,037
l don't know how to answer you,
except to say l teach you my truths.

751
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,198
lt is kind of scary,
dealing with the truth.

752
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,470
Scary and dangerous.

753
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,792
Have you ever had a salad
with almonds and grapes...

754
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,436
...and tomatoes and lettuce
and pineapple?

755
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,592
She's in love with you, Mark.

756
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,995
You shouldn't be so surprised.

757
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,840
We have marvelous schools now
in the East End.

758
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,714
lt's still difficult
to get quality teachers.

759
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,275
Take us,
the bottom of the pile.

760
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,514
Goodness knows we've had
a scruffy lot here.

761
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,715
Then along comes
Mr. Mark Thackeray...

762
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,197
...big, broad, handsome,
clean, intelligent...

763
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,790
...looking like
he stepped out of a bandbox.

764
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,798
What do you expect?

765
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,479
What do l do?

766
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,149
Nothing. Just be patient.

767
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,874
Thanks.

768
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,359
Pamela's just finding out
she's a grown woman.

769
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,830
You're probably the only real man
she's ever met in her life.

770
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,395
Don't spend too much time
alone with her.

771
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,872
Why didn't you ask Gillian?

772
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,353
l thought you'd be wiser.

773
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,515
Thanks.

774
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,033
Hello, Sir!
We can't have you queuing up.

775
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,313
lt's Sir. He teaches
our Moira up at North Quay.

776
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,034
He's only got an hour for his lunch.

777
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,117
-What'll it be?
-Half a dozen oranges.

778
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,231
You'll like them.
They're lovely.

779
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,589
Here you are, Guv.

780
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,800
Penny's wedding cake.
Jeannie's older sister.

781
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,196
She got married,
so here's a bit of cake.

782
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,192
Jeannie Clark.

783
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,193
Yes, Miss Clark.

784
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,711
That was a lovely museum outing.
Will they do it again?

785
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,755
We're trying to arrange one a week.

786
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,393
That'd be lovely, won't it?

787
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,470
The more education, the better.
That's what l always say.

788
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,873
lt's a proper bleeder,
what with the bomb and all.

789
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,958
Ain't the bombs.
lt's them bleeding Yanks!

790
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,999
Shut your gob!
My Gert's married to a Yank.

791
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,510
And a proper nice gent he is and all.

792
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,677
Keep your opinions to yourself!

793
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,475
God all bloody mighty!
The <i>entente cordiale</i>?

794
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,548
Cast the mote out of your eye
before you cast the bomb out of mine!

795
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,229
He's a proper faggot.
Here, you'll like them.

796
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,356
Thank you.

797
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,676
Who's next?
Come on, girls.

798
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,154
Speak up!

799
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,478
l was wondering if you would also give
the girls some lessons in makeup.

800
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,674
l think quite a few
of them would be...

801
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,629
...very pretty if they knew
how to do it.

802
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,512
Why, certainly.

803
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,636
You are getting involved
with your children, aren't you?

804
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,878
l'm just trying to help.
That's the job, isn't it?

805
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,310
-You want some of this?
-No, thanks.

806
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,512
ls that all you're having?

807
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,358
You on a diet?

808
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,995
l'll tell you, l'm a weak man.

809
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,078
At the moment, a little skint.

810
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,079
When l eat, do l love to eat!

811
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,669
l love wine,
but l just can't have a glass.

812
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,234
l want the whole bottle.

813
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,432
So l avoid wine
and pastrami sandwiches...

814
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,233
...and baked potatoes...

815
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,717
...with butter and bacon...

816
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,919
...and strawberry shortcake
and cheesecake.

817
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,630
But l like to eat light for lunch.

818
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,635
How's the Dare girl?

819
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,033
No problems.

820
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,713
-Are you gonna stay on here?
-Until l get sorted out.

821
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,873
No luck with the jobs?

822
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,832
But l'm plugging away.

823
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,031
Remember a few weeks ago,
you thought you'd lost the battle?

824
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,634
l thought you had too.

825
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,559
There's a good angel
looking after me, somewhere.

826
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,870
Come on.
Sort yourselves out.

827
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,914
Come on, hurry up!

828
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,872
All right? Go!

829
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,510
Come on, Denham, hurry it up.

830
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,437
Land on your toes.
Do it again. Next!

831
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,670
Next!

832
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,159
Buckley!

833
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,350
Come on, boy.

834
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,834
l'm not a boy.
l'm a man.

835
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,872
l don't want to do it.
lt's too high.

836
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,832
You're a fat boy.
Come on.

837
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,792
l'm waiting.
Get that jelly off!

838
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,150
Fats can't do it.
lt's too high for him.

839
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,839
Of course, he can't do it!

840
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,152
When l want your opinion,
l'll ask, boy.

841
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,396
-l'm not a boy.
-Shut up!

842
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,517
Buckley, do as you're told!

843
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,914
Come on!

844
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,115
-Move out of the way, boy.
-Shut up!

845
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,390
ls he all right?

846
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,556
l don't know.

847
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,195
You bloody bastard!

848
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,674
Put that down!

849
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,838
You knew Fats couldn't do that.
You had it in for him.

850
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,594
Potter, put that down!

851
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,279
They're fighting in the gym!

852
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,039
Come on, Potts!

853
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,479
That was no accident!

854
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,119
l'll take that.

855
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,154
Go and help Buckley.

856
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,555
Go on!

857
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,753
Potts should have done the bastard
like he did Fats.

858
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,636
You all right, boy?

859
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,115
Yes, thank you.
Me stomach didn't half hurt.

860
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,312
Jackson, lngram?
Help him up to Mrs. Evans.

861
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,674
All right.

862
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,833
What happened?

863
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,193
Buckley's all right.

864
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,395
More frightened than anything else.

865
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,916
Why'd you make him do that jump?

866
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,354
He just stood there
and refused to obey.

867
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,076
When he jumped, he sent the buck flying
and l couldn't catch him.

868
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,392
Thanks for helping me out.
That Potter went berserk.

869
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,317
l understand that Buckley is
a pet whipping boy of yours.

870
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,669
ls that right?

871
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,353
l'd better report it.
There'll be the devil to pay.

872
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,590
Potter, l can't think of anything
that excuses your behaviour.

873
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,398
But it was him!
He made Fats do it.

874
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,150
Fats said he couldn't do it.
The bully always had it in for him.

875
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,869
l am not concerned with
Mr. Bell's behaviour, but yours.

876
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,469
What if a gun or knife
had been handy?

877
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,917
Potter was narked.
We was all narked.

878
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,156
That bleeder was wrong
and you know it.

879
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,874
You're missing the point.
You all are.

880
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,230
Soon you will be out in the world.

881
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,829
Will you use a weapon every time
someone angers you?

882
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,800
You're supposed to
be learning self-discipline.

883
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,435
You owe Mr. Bell an apology.

884
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,557
Why?
Just because Bell is a teacher?

885
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,751
You better answer that, Potter.

886
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,190
Do you think you behaved
like an adult?

887
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,837
How about Bell
apologizing to Buckley?

888
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,192
My business is with you,
not Mr. Bell.

889
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,472
lt's easy for you to talk.
No one pushes you around.

890
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,913
Are you a man or a hoodlum?

891
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,673
Do it, Potts!

892
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,475
Or Bell will call the law
if you don't.

893
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,113
You've got to have recommends
for a job in a couple weeks.

894
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,549
He's got to sign one.

895
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,268
This has nothing
to do with what l sign.

896
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,512
You can't trust a teacher.

897
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,360
We're only safe together.
Against them.

898
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,596
But Sir is different.
lf he says Potts--

899
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,348
That he is, and he's wrong now.

900
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,238
You all know Bell's been after
old Fats for years.

901
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,273
Go on, Potts.

902
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,594
lf you apologize
because you're afraid...

903
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,792
...then you're a child, not a man.

904
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,439
When l leave,
l'll have me own barrow.

905
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,872
So you can't touch me,
letters or no letters.

906
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,273
l'm sorry l'm late, Sir.

907
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,239
But it's me mum.

908
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,758
She's dead.

909
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,715
l've been helping me dad
with her things.

910
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,949
-l didn't know where to go, Sir.
-That's all right.

911
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,474
lngram, take over the class.

912
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,353
l understand that
the passing-out class holds...

913
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,791
...some kind of a celebration
at the end of term.

914
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,399
What happens?

915
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,354
We dance...

916
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,914
...Sir.

917
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,351
Did you apologize because of Denham?

918
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,110
One should fight
for what one believes...

919
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,674
...provided one is absolutely sure...

920
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,394
...one is absolutely right.

921
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,234
Pass these out.

922
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,951
You have to fill those out...

923
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,798
...for national health insurance
and so on.

924
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,837
What are you doing, Jackson?

925
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,830
lt's for Seales.
For flowers and a wreath.

926
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,477
That's wonderful of you.

927
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,514
May l be permitted
to contribute something?

928
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,791
No, thank you, Mr. Thackeray.

929
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,070
Here, Pam, you buy the wreath.

930
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,789
The name's Dare.

931
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,069
Miss Dare.

932
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,873
Well, you buy the wreath.

933
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,635
Send it around when the time's right.

934
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,634
Send it?
Aren't you going to take it?

935
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,950
You don't think
girls could take it, do you?

936
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,311
Well, why not?

937
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,315
lt's what people would say, Sir.

938
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,877
What the family would say...

939
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,030
...if they saw us going
into a coloured person's home.

940
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,791
We've got nothing against you, Sir.

941
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,195
Honest.

942
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,837
But if one of us was to....

943
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,315
You can't imagine the things be said.

944
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,635
Thank you, Miss Pegg,
for making it clear.

945
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,957
Does that apply to the men also?

946
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,876
You're dead right it does.

947
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,789
l'll take the flowers.

948
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,553
Why should you do that?

949
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,956
Wouldn't that make you
subject to gossip?

950
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,639
Gossip don't worry me.
l've known Seales since kindergarten.

951
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,191
l'll take the flowers.

952
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,195
l wouldn't if l were you.

953
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,752
l've been looking for you.

954
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,508
There's a lady to see you.
Mrs. Dare.

955
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,278
And by the way, l've canceled
all outings for your class.

956
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,555
Why?

957
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,552
The adult approach hasn't worked.

958
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,357
lt'd have been better
to let things be.

959
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,996
You'd better take your boys in for P.T.
until l get a replacement.

960
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,670
l'm sorry to disturb you, Sir.
lt's about Pam.

961
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,915
l'm Mrs. Dare.

962
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,158
What can l do for you?
Would you have a seat?

963
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,830
Would you talk to her, Sir?
l'm sure she'd listen to you.

964
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,236
-She's always talking about you.
-What's the problem?

965
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,154
She always stays out
late at night, Sir.

966
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,829
Often she doesn't get home
till past 1 1 .

967
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,516
She never says where she's been.

968
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,360
She's a big girl.
l'm worried about her.

969
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,275
She won't listen to me.

970
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,798
l'm just a teacher, Mrs. Dare.

971
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,513
l know she'd listen to you.

972
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,031
lt's always ''Sir said this''
or ''Sir said that.''

973
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,437
See, she won't listen to me.
She just won't.

974
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,712
Why doesn't her father
talk with her?

975
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,872
We're divorced.

976
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,799
He's up north somewhere.
He doesn't--

977
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,914
lt's not wrong to--

978
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,716
When your marriage breaks up,
life doesn't end, does it?

979
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,831
Please talk to her, Sir.
l'm frightened for her.

980
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,476
You never know what sort
of trouble she can get into.

981
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,149
Please?

982
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,197
All right, l will.

983
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,274
Thank you.

984
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,229
Morning, Sir.

985
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,796
Hello, luv.

986
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,594
-Morning.
-How are you? How's the kids?

987
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,756
Hello, Guv!

988
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,710
Hello, Sir.
lt's a lovely day, isn't it?

989
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,230
Your kid ain't top of the class.

990
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,314
My, you look as if
you've won the pools.

991
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,630
Better!

992
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,718
l got me a job.
A real one for when school ends.

993
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,514
Assistant engineer
in a factory in the Midlands.

994
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,075
They even sent me the fare!

995
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,509
That's marvelous.

996
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,473
lt's not that good,
but it's a start after so long.

997
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,637
Do you think
she'll take the flowers?

998
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,268
l don't know.

999
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,032
Go in. Sir wants you.

1000
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,708
Sit down.
l'd like to talk to you.

1001
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,997
Has my mum been in?

1002
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,752
The funeral's Saturday, 1 0:30.

1003
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,633
About my mum, Sir?

1004
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,639
She's very worried about you,
Miss Dare.

1005
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,317
Couldn't you call me Pamela?

1006
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,710
l think not, for the moment.

1007
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,072
She says that
you've been staying out late.

1008
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,319
l've just been to Gran's.
Just around the corner, not far.

1009
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,111
Why haven't you told your mother?

1010
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,913
She doesn't care about me.

1011
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,156
You know that's not true.

1012
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,034
You're not in trouble, are you?

1013
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,995
Nowadays that's only for fools,
isn't it?

1014
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,520
We're the luckiest kids,
the luckiest generation...

1015
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,075
...that's ever been, aren't we?

1016
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,319
We're the first to be really free
to enjoy life if we want...

1017
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,828
...without fear.

1018
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,434
What is the trouble?

1019
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,950
lf you don't want to talk,
say the word.

1020
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,559
lt doesn't bother me.

1021
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,193
lt was all right
up till about a year ago.

1022
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,353
Of course, l miss Daddy.
He was wonderful.

1023
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,030
But it's just one of those things.

1024
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,432
Mum works up in a dress shop
on the West End.

1025
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,432
And we got on fine.

1026
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,879
Then men friends started
calling on her.

1027
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,076
You know what neighbours are like.

1028
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,714
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

1029
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,157
She doesn't like me.
l'm in the way.

1030
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,996
She's young and pretty, isn't she?

1031
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,750
l'll be glad to leave school
and be on my own.

1032
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,631
Obviously your mother loves you.

1033
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,070
And you owe her much more
than any teacher.

1034
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,669
l think you're wrong about her.

1035
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,192
Did she tell you that l found her
with one of her friends?

1036
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,596
At home? At my home?

1037
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,390
No, l bet she didn't,
but she was!

1038
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,514
l can't solve your problems for you.
But staying out late won't help.

1039
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,075
lt helps me.
l can't stand the sight of her!

1040
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,635
And if you were me,
you'd feel the same.

1041
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,117
l'm in no position to judge.
l know people make mistakes.

1042
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,674
You're saying it's my fault?

1043
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,952
Forgiveness is the gift of God.
People make mistakes.

1044
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,878
lt's up to you to make peace.

1045
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,592
-Why should l? l haven't done anything.
-Grow up.

1046
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,751
Give her another chance.

1047
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,355
Why are you taking her side?

1048
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,151
You're wrong not to give her a chance.
Everybody deserves that.

1049
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,474
l thought you'd understand.
l thought l could trust you.

1050
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:14,469
But you're just as Denham said.
l'm not taking the bloody flowers!

1051
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,508
All right.

1052
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,756
Let's line up here
in the centre.

1053
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,111
Could we box first today, please?

1054
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,190
Why?

1055
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,919
lt would make a change.

1056
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,149
Just sort yourselves in pairs now.

1057
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,510
Do you mind having a go with me?
Sapiano's hurt his wrist.

1058
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,313
That's right. l sprained it.

1059
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:38,276
l think you ought to wait and have a go
at Potter or one of the others.

1060
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,232
He'll be done in, Sir.

1061
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,720
l don't mind having
a punch out with you.

1062
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,313
l think you'd better
forget that for today.

1063
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,353
Let's go!

1064
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,356
Let's go.

1065
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,113
Stay where you are!

1066
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,313
Put your head down.

1067
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,755
Collect the gloves and put them back.

1068
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,634
The rest of you,
line up for vaulting.

1069
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,953
Put your head down.

1070
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,868
You all right?

1071
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,988
-Come over here for a minute.
-l'm all right.

1072
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,991
l think l'll go wash up.

1073
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,188
You all right, mate?

1074
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,515
Are you sure?

1075
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,597
Can l ask you something?

1076
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,440
-How many times did you hit me?
-Once.

1077
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,355
l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to hurt you.

1078
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,868
l lost my temper.

1079
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,679
l was meaning to hurt you.

1080
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,474
You did.
You're pretty good.

1081
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,398
Why didn't you hit me again?

1082
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,991
Why didn't you fight?
You had me easy.

1083
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,316
l've been after you
since you got here.

1084
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,477
Are you afraid or something?

1085
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,394
Hitting you wouldn't solve much,
would it?

1086
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,513
lt's the truth.
l don't understand you at all.

1087
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,709
What's a barrow?

1088
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,232
A barrow? With fruit on it.
A barrow!

1089
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,238
You was wrong about Potts.

1090
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,353
Yes, from his point of view,
at his age, l was.

1091
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,438
-The girls was right about the gossip.
-From their point of view.

1092
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,278
What other point is there?

1093
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,994
You have to figure that out
for yourself.

1094
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,712
Would you like a job teaching
the youngsters how to box?

1095
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,479
l'll speak with Mr. Florian.
There will be some money for you.

1096
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,952
Me? A bleeding teacher?

1097
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,437
lt's important the youngsters
know how to defend themselves.

1098
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,794
Why are you doing this?

1099
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,913
Good luck with your barrow.

1100
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,671
What's the matter?
You going to a bleeding wedding?

1101
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,115
You don't half pong, Potts!

1102
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,594
-What's up with you, Fats?
-Nothing, Bert.

1103
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,429
Another week and
we'll be through here.

1104
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,992
l ain't got a job yet.

1105
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,076
You had the bleeder yesterday.
Lucky punch.

1106
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,040
You got eyes in the back of your head.

1107
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,073
He could have done me
with one hand behind his back.

1108
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,114
And none of your bleeding here.
There's ladies present.

1109
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:46,272
What Sir said about the truth,
it's kind of scary, isn't it?

1110
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,993
Good morning.

1111
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,593
About the party,
we've got a group and all.

1112
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
And the girls is fixing the grub.
You coming?

1113
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:00,916
You inviting me?

1114
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,752
Yeah, you're invited.

1115
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,833
Thank you.

1116
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,432
lf l can, l certainly will.

1117
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,756
What you said is right,
about a man making up his own mind.

1118
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,712
My goodness!

1119
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,391
You certainly look lovely.

1120
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:59,829
Thank you.

1121
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,954
Would you dance with me tonight?

1122
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,314
Of course.

1123
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,558
But nothing too fast.
l am getting too old for that.

1124
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,992
We'll make it special.
Promise?

1125
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,469
Promise.

1126
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,069
Thank you.

1127
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:21,318
Would you call me Pamela tonight?

1128
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,630
Pamela.

1129
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,954
Thank you.

1130
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,468
Excuse me a minute, Bert.
lt's Pam.

1131
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,198
-You look marvelous!
-You look great!

1132
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,436
-Where's the other earring?
-lt's the thing.

1133
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,188
-l wanna talk to the group. Come.
-Why?

1134
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,879
Come on, l'll tell you.

1135
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,394
Good evening.

1136
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,113
l hear you're leaving.

1137
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,154
lt's a pity.

1138
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,391
l'm sorry about that.
You're damn good.

1139
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,352
You've done wonders for this show.

1140
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,836
Thank you very much.

1141
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,556
Anybody can be an engineer,
but teaching this mob is....

1142
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,876
l wish l had your gift.

1143
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,916
Why so serious, Mark?

1144
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,350
Good God, it's Weston!

1145
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,158
Wrap up, Clinty.

1146
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,748
Well, l'm damned!

1147
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,188
He wasn't giving you
a hard time, was he?

1148
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,959
On the contrary.

1149
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,833
Will you wave your magic wand
and make me sweet 1 6 again?

1150
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,955
Nothing to do with me.

1151
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,159
A fine lad.
Your hand's in this, all right.

1152
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,240
lf you must leave,
go to another school.

1153
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,309
You can't waste your talent
on electronics.

1154
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,919
Damn!
l swore l wouldn't interfere.

1155
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,398
Would you like some more?

1156
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,277
-Who made it?
-l did.

1157
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,315
lt's salad North Quay,
one of Sir's special recipes.

1158
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,909
lt's bloody marvelous, Barbara.

1159
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,078
l mean, Miss Pegg.

1160
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,920
Thank you, Mr. Weston,
l'm sure.

1161
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,995
Actually, l don't like it.
l think it's terrible, don't you?

1162
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,633
Blimey, l'm hot!

1163
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:16,790
Thank you.

1164
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,799
Excuse me, Sir.
l got the job l wanted.

1165
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:20,990
That's wonderful.

1166
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,430
-What is it?
-Pageboy at the Hilton.

1167
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,315
He can't wait to get
all that Yankee money.

1168
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,999
You're right there.

1169
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,271
l don't want to be
a pageboy all me life.

1170
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,630
Will you help me get
into night school?

1171
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,069
l'd be glad to.

1172
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,634
Ta, Sir.

1173
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,956
You ain't half a dolly, Miss.

1174
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,469
Ready, Pam.

1175
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,714
Attention, everybody!

1176
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:49,076
By special request,
it's a lady's choice.

1177
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,396
Hold that, please.

1178
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,359
Come on.
Everybody, come here.

1179
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,474
Thank you.

1180
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:34,072
Can l come and see you
sometimes, next term?

1181
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:35,475
l won't be here.

1182
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,673
Everybody's got to move on.

1183
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,238
l'm glad l met you, though.
You've helped me a lot.

1184
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,078
We were lucky to have you.

1185
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,796
The whole world's waiting for you.
You're a smasher!

1186
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:49,830
Thanks.

1187
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,390
Bye.

1188
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,194
Hold it! Listen, everybody.
l've got an announcement.

1189
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,390
lt's about Sir.

1190
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,078
We'd like to thank you
for everything you've done.

1191
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,918
We'd like to give you
a present to remember us by.

1192
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,952
-Come on, Babs.
-You mean, Miss Pegg.

1193
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,630
<i>The time has come</i>

1194
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,716
<i>For closing books</i>

1195
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,997
<i>And long last looks must end</i>

1196
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,359
<i>And as I leave</i>

1197
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,596
<i>I know that I am leaving</i>

1198
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,916
<i>My best friend</i>

1199
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,952
<i>A friend who taught me</i>
<i>Right from wrong</i>

1200
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,032
<i>And weak from strong</i>

1201
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,436
<i>That's a lot to learn</i>

1202
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,315
<i>What can I give you</i>

1203
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,549
<i>In return</i>

1204
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,312
<i>If you wanted the moon</i>

1205
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,120
<i>I would try to make a start</i>

1206
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:22,154
<i>But I would rather you let me</i>

1207
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,716
<i>Give my heart</i>

1208
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,350
<i>To Sir, with love</i>

1209
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,430
Speech! Speech!

1210
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,955
l think l'd better go
and put it away.

1211
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,876
Evening, Guv.

1212
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,828
Nice, isn't it?

1213
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,759
l'm in your bleeding class
next term.
