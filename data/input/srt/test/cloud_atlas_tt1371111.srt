1
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,260
Lornsome night.

2
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:04,057
Babbits bawlin', wind bitin' the bone.

3
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,811
Wind like this...

4
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,022
full of voices.

5
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,235
Ancestry howlin' at ya,

6
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,321
yibberin' stories.

7
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:25,161
All voices... tied up in't'one.

8
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:30,000
One voice different...

9
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,294
One voice,

10
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:39,342
whisperin' out there,
spyin' from the dark.

11
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:44,180
That fangy devil,

12
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:48,184
Ol' Georgie himself.

13
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,523
Now you hear up close,

14
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:58,653
and I'll yarn you about
the first time we met,

15
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:01,072
eye to eye.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,206
<i>And thus it was that I made the
acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose,</i>

17
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:12,083
<i>the man I hoped might
cure me of my affliction.</i>

18
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,056
Have you lost something?

19
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,726
Question one.

20
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:35,941
What secret in Sixsmith's report
would be worth killing for?

21
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,567
Question two.

22
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:42,822
Is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret?

23
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:45,825
And if so, question three.

24
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,869
What the fuck am I doing here?

25
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,082
<i>While my extensive
experience as an editor</i>

26
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,417
<i>has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks</i>

27
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:58,463
<i>and flashforwards, and all
such tricksy gimmicks,</i>

28
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,882
<i>I believe that if you, dear reader,</i>

29
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:04,052
<i>can extend your patience
for a just a moment,</i>

30
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:08,098
<i>you will find there is a method
to this tale of madness.</i>

31
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,059
<i>My dearest Sixsmith,</i>

32
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,521
<i>I shot myself through the roof
of my mouth this morning,</i>

33
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,356
<i>with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger.</i>

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,655
<i>A true suicide is a paced,
disciplined certainty.</i>

35
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,786
<i>People pontificate "suicide
is an coward's act".</i>

36
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,372
<i>Couldn't be further from the truth.</i>

37
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,333
<i>Suicide takes tremendous courage.</i>

38
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:41,088
Any problem, sir,
you just hit this button.

39
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,173
Thank you.

40
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:52,684
On behalf of my Ministry,
and the future of Unanimity,

41
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:56,187
I would like to thank you
for this final interview.

42
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:07,157
– Hello.
– Press pass.

43
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:09,534
Expecting trouble?

44
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:14,080
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher,
not his shrink or his astrologer,

45
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,291
and the ruddy, bloody truth is,

46
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,128
I had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night.

47
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:24,633
This beach was once
a cannibal's banqueting hall,

48
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:29,763
where the strong gorged on the weak,
but the teeth, sir, they spat out,

49
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,683
like you or I would
expel a cherry stone.

50
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:39,189
Do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn?

51
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:43,944
Remember this is not
an interrogation or a trial.

52
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,698
Your version of the truth
is all that matters.

53
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:52,035
Truth is singular.

54
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,665
Its "versions" are... mistruths.

55
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:00,835
<i>Don't let them say
I killed myself for love.</i>

56
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:05,130
<i>Had my infatuations, but we
both know in our hearts</i>

57
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:08,009
<i>who is the sole love
of my short, bright life.</i>

58
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,186

PACIFIC ISLANDS, 1849

60
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:38,123
There you are, Mr. Ewing,

61
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:41,835
as binding a covenant
there can ever be between men...

62
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,045
outside the province of Scripture.

63
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,046
Thank you, Reverend Horrox, I...

64
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,842
know my father-in-law is
profoundly excited about this deal.

65
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:51,636
Haskell Moore is a great man.

66
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,556
Future generations depend
on men like him,

67
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,475
men capable of speaking the truth.

68
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,935
Quite.

69
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:05,734
When I first encountered
Haskell Moore's writing,

70
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:09,821
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation.

71
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,279
The learned doctor here and I,

72
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,742
already spent many a night
debating Mr. Moore's tractus.

73
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,132
I'm only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case

74
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:19,497
as to why we are sitting here,
enjoying this divine lamb,

75
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,919
while Kupaka stands
there, contempt to serve.

76
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:26,296
Indeed, ain'it.
Uh, Kupaka...

77
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,133
you enjoy your life here
with us, do you not?

78
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,302
Oh, yes, Reverend, sir.

79
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:34,346
Kupaka very happy here.

80
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,723
See, you see, this is Moore's
ladder of civilization.

81
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:39,184
The reason behind this natural order...

82
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,769
Please, Giles, do shut up.

83
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,271
I've been listening to
this for weeks, I...

84
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:46,650
would love to know what his own
son-in-law has to say about it.

85
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:48,818
Let's see...

86
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:53,323
It is an inquiry concerning
God's will and the nature of men.

87
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,867
And what does he have to say
about the nature of women?

88
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:01,248
I'm afraid that's a subject
he prefers to pass by in silence.

89
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,708
He wouldn't be the first.

90
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,961
Uh, prey, Mr. Ewing, continue.

91
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,548
Well, uh... the question
he does pose is...

92
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:13,842
if God created the world, how do
we know what things we can change,

93
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:17,639
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable?

94
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,894
Reverend Horrox' real specific
how to run plantation.

95
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:25,355
Georgian way best way he say.

96
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:28,191
God, this heat is unbearable.
How do they take it?

97
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,151
Reverend Horrox say

98
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:33,196
slaves like camel, bred for desert.

99
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:37,200
He say... they not feel
heat like civilized folk.

100
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,744
Now we should get you out of the sun.

101
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,666
Now what... what is that noise?

102
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:52,067
– Ah, there you are.
– What happened?

103
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:57,364
It is as I suspected.
Gusano Coco Cervello,

104
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,616
better known as the Polynesian worm.

105
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:02,869
Once saw a man's brain after
the worm had finished with him...

106
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:04,663
maggoty cauliflower. Ooph.

107
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:10,794
But have no fear, this particular
devil and I... are well acquainted.

108
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,590
Here we go.
Ah, yes, yes, all gone.

109
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:23,265
I-I don't know what I would have
done had our paths not crossed.

110
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,183
Well for starters, you would have died.

111
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,813
I... I shall find a way to repay you.

112
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:34,484
Oh, unnecessary, I assure you.
I am a doctor, Adam.

113
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,320
A tiger cannot change its stripes.

114

CAMBRIDGE, 1936

115
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:45,203
<i>Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me.</i>

116
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:49,040
<i>Mr. Frobisher.</i>

117
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:54,004
<i>Mr. Robert Frobisher!</i>

118
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:59,467
The management would like
a word with you, please, sir.

119
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,224
<i>Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!</i>

120
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:10,937
I do know you're in there, Mr. Frobisher,
please, comply.

121
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:18,236
A letter is being drafted
to your father, sir.

122
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,916
<i>Mr. Frobisher!</i>

123
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,087
<i>Hated leaving you like that.
Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.</i>

124
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:44,137
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be on my way to Edinburgh,</i>

125
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,015
<i>on my way to fame and fortune.</i>

126
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:50,227
<i>I know you haven't heard of him,
but trust me,</i>

127
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:54,272
<i>Vyvyan Ayrs is one of
the musical greats, Sixsmith.</i>

128
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:58,318
<i>The tragedy is that he hasn't produced
any new work in years due to illness.</i>

129
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:03,031
<i>My scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis,</i>

130
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,909
<i>and aid him in the creation
of a masterpiece,</i>

131
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:08,953
<i>before shooting up through
the musical firmament,</i>

132
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:11,790
<i>eventually obliging
Pater to admit that yes,</i>

133
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:15,292
<i>the son he disinherited is none
other than Robert Frobisher,</i>

134
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:18,672
<i>the greatest British composer of his time.</i>

135
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:23,176
<i>I know, Sixsmith, you groan and
shake your head, but you smile too,</i>

136
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:25,011
<i>which is why I love you.</i>

137
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,472
<i>P.S.:</i>

138
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,016
<i>Thanks for the waistcoat.</i>

139
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:34,062
<i>I needed something of yours
to keep me company.</i>

140
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,482
St. George and the Dragon.

141
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,028
Reminds me that composing is a crusade.

142
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:44,698
Sometimes you slay the dragon,

143
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:48,243
sometimes the dragon slays you.

144
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:50,871
Alright, then.

145
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,373
Frobisher, is it?

146
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,710
I trust Mackerras told
you enough to be useful.

147
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,754
I've had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months,

148
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,632
let's see if you can get it down.

149
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,607
Subtle grace note before the third.

150
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:26,740
Soft and simple. Got it?
Now, it gets interesting.

151
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:38,752
Good.

152
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,420
Play that back.

153
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,424
Would love to, sir.

154
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:50,138
Um... what key are we in?

155
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,974
What key?
G minor, of course.

156
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,060
And the time signature?

157
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,896
For Christ's sake, did you hear it or not?

158
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,107
– Just... just need a little more time.
– You need?

159
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,110
My dear boy, who is working for whom here?

160
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,821
– I apologize, sir...
– Are you an amanuensis or an apologist?

161
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:07,781
Now pay attention.

162
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,950
Three-four, changes to
four-four on fourth bar

163
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,618
and back to three-four on bar five,

164
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,453
if you can count that high.

165
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,375
Crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat
G quaver, then E-flat on the down beat.

166
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,128
And so on.

167
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,631
Alright, let me hear you.

168
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,828
Stop, please! You're hurting me!

169
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:58,123
You must have misheard me,
I said I had a melody not a malady!

170
00:13:58,164 --> 00:13:59,583
Vyvyan...

171
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:02,085
Jocasta, deliver me!

172
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:06,256
– What's going on in here?
– An exercise in futility.

173
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:07,632
Should I be introduced?

174
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,844
There's really no point,
the boy is useful as the clap.

175
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,638
Fortunately, he'll be much
easier to get rid of.

176
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,558
Would you be a dear
and get Henry to show the boy out.

177
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,727
Yes, of course, darling.

178
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,621
That's beautiful.

179
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,916
Yes...

180
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,086
That's it.
That's my melody!

181
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,508
SAN FRANCISCO, 1973

182
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,137
Com'on, Luisa, we're made to be together!

183
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:56,681
Luisa, Luisa, com'on, com'on,
I'm telling you,

184
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,184
I'm telling you baby,
you can't leave me. It's a...

185
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:01,728
Don't know if it's a past life thing
or a future life thing,

186
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,104
but you know, you and me...

187
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:07,567
Look. For the last hour, all I could think
about was throwing you off the balcony.

188
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,070
Well then who the hell you think you are?

189
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:13,490
You write a bullshit
column for a fucking rag.

190
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,158
Elevator!

191
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,163
Thank you.

192
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:27,254
Nice to know the age
of chivalry isn't dead.

193
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,894
You okay?

194
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,647
No bones broken, I think.

195
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:50,318
No, no, no, you sit... you sit yourself.
Let me see.

196
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:02,289
Great. Power outage.

197
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:06,167
Perfect end to a perfect day.

198
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,633
Still glad the age of chivalry isn't dead?

199
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:19,055
I'd still rather be right here
than back up there.

200
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:22,225
Guess Mr. Kipin isn't
everyone's cup of tea.

201
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:26,062
Guys like that are just
an occupational hazard.

202
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:31,943
– You were interviewing him?
– Yeah, for Spyglass magazine.

203
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:34,863
Luisa Rey.

204
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,948
Rufus Sixsmith.

205
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,034
Rey...

206
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,290
You wouldn't happen to be related
to the journalist Lester Rey?

207
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,501
Yeah.
He was my father.

208
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,006
Really? He must have been
enormously proud of you,

209
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,175
– following in his footsteps.
– Hmm.

210
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,263
That's her. My niece, Megan.

211
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,140
She's lovely!

212
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:06,519
Born physicist, with a better mind
for mathematics than I ever had.

213
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:10,523
Did her PhD at Cambridge,
a woman at Caius!

214
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,318
Gives you hope for the world.

215
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,156
It's hot.

216
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:23,703
And we're still here.

217
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,006
That's a very peculiar birthmark.

218
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:39,636
Yeah.
My little comet.

219
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,889
My mother was sure it was cancer,

220
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,058
she wanted me to get it removed, but...

221
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,769
don't know. I kinda like it.

222
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:52,023
I knew someone who had
a birthmark that was...

223
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,943
– similar to that.
– Really?

224
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,611
Who was it?

225
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,574
Someone I cared about very much.

226
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:09,040
A uh... a hypothetical
question for you, Miss Rey.

227
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,419
As a journalist,

228
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,547
what price would you pay
to protect the source?

229
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,465
Any.

230
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,467
Prison?

231
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:23,722
If it came to that, yes.

232
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,182
Would you be prepared to...

233
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,310
compromise your safety?

234
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:36,233
My father braved booby-trapped marshes and

235
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:39,613
the wrath of generals
for his journalistic integrity.

236
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:44,576
What kind of daughter would I be if I
bailed when things got a little tough?

237
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:02,010
Saved.

238
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,137
Taxi!

239
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:08,391
– You sure you don't need a cab?
– No, I've got my car.

240
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,105
Well, you know if... there's ever
something I can do for you,

241
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:16,024
please give me a call.

242
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,818
Thank you, I will.

243
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:20,403
Bye.

244
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,117
LONDON, 2012

245
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,745
<i>It was the night of the Lemon Prizes,</i>

246
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,791
<i>and in its two lead forced duality,</i>

247
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,002
<i>I recall a moment of introspection.</i>

248
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:42,425
<i>Why. Why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher?</i>

249
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,720
<i>This was the precise moment
that Dermot found me.</i>

250
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:48,431
– Oy, Timothy.
– Aah, Dermot.

251
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:51,268
<i>Bad news inexorably does.</i>

252
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:52,602
Fockin' waste.

253
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,521
Never forget Herman Melville,

254
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:59,442
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed,

255
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,696
and yet today, it is lugged
around in the backpacks

256
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,073
of every serious student
of literature in the world.

257
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,199
I don't give a fock what
happens when I'm dead,

258
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,035
I want people to buy me book now!

259
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:13,164
Well, as your publisher, obviously
nothing would make me happier.

260
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,542
But sadly, for whatever reason,

261
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,295
"Knuckle Sandwich" has yet
to connect to its audience.

262
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,505
You want a reason? I'll give you a reason.

263
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,383
– Right there!
– Aah. You mean Mr. Finch?

264
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,343
Felix fockin' Finch!

265
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:30,473
That cunt that shat all over me book
in his poncy fockin' magazine!

266
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,976
– It wasn't that bad!
– No?

267
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:40,442
"Mr. Hoggins should apologize to
the trees failed for the making of his

268
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,821
bloated autobio novel.
Four hundred vain-glorious pages

269
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:49,659
expire in an ending that is flat
and inane beyond belief."

270
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:55,498
Steady now, Dermot. What is a critic
but one who reads quickly,

271
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:58,835
arrogantly, but never wisely.

272
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,800
Fock it.

273
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:07,886
Dermot!

274
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,272
Ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:23,568
We have an additional award tonight,
fellow book faeries.

276
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:26,988
An award for "most eminent critic".

277
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:30,158
Mr... oh, beg pardon,

278
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:35,580
SIR! Felix Finch.
O, B and E!

279
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:42,629
And what might my prize be, I wonder?

280
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:46,758
A signed copy of an
unpulped "Knuckle Sandwich"?

281
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:49,177
Can't be many of those left.

282
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:54,224
Well...

283
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,978
Just what does that lead-less
pencil you call an imagination

284
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:02,649
have in mind to end this scene. Hmm?

285
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,365
I think you're gonna love this one.

286
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,296
Now, that's an ending that is
flat n'inane beyond belief.

287
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:30,719
<i>My thoughts?</i>

288
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:34,472
<i>If I'm honest, I admit that the
obvious emotions like shock</i>

289
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:37,809
<i>and horror flew as Finch had,
here and gone.</i>

290
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,853
Tequila, couple of fingers.

291
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:44,106
<i>While deep down,
I experienced a nascent sense</i>

292
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:48,278
<i>of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn.</i>

293
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:54,618
<i>Overnight, Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man.</i>

294
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:04,419
<i>"Knuckle Sandwich" shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months.</i>

295
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:07,923
<i>I was for the briefest
of moments, Cinderella,</i>

296
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:12,761
<i>and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror</i>

297
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:15,180
<i>of my dream come true.</i>

298
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:21,561
– What the fuck...
– Tim-o-tee Cavendish... oy presume.

299
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:23,146
Caught wi' your cacks down!

300
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:27,191
Uh, my office hours are eleven to two,
and my secretary

301
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,320
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire.

302
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:32,446
Friends like us don't
need appointments.

303
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,241
We like it all cozy like this.

304
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:38,119
– Visited Dermot in the joint.
– Our brother's got a question for you.

305
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:41,164
Where's our focking money?

306
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,210
Boys. Boys, look here.

307
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:48,587
Dermot signed what we call
a copyright transfer contract,

308
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:50,048
which means that legally...

309
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:54,928
Dermot didn't sign a fockin' contract
for the event of a fockin' season!

310
00:23:55,053 --> 00:24:00,392
Er, Perhap-perhaps... er, we could
moot a provisional sum...

311
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:03,050
as a basis for on-going negotiation.

312
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,219
Okeydokey.

313
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:09,025
What sum we gonna moot?

314
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,528
Fifty K will do for starters.

315
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,363
Fifty sounds reasonable.

316
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:15,240
Tomorrow afternoon.

317
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,242
Tomorrow afternoon?

318
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,037
– Cash.
– No bullocks.

319
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,253
– No checks.
– Old fashioned money.

320
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:22,745
Gentlemen...

321
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:25,333
– The law says...
– The law?!

322
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:35,343
What'd the law do
for Felix fockin' Finch?

323
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:42,267
NEO SEOUL 2144

324
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:49,107
Ordinarily, I begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories...

325
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,446
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future.

326
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:57,824
Fabricants have no such
memories, Archivist.

327
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,747
One twenty-four hour cycle in Papa
Song's is identical to every other.

328
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,709
May I say you speak
Consumer surprisingly well.

329
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,662
[speaks Korean]

330
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:13,465
<i>It is unfortunate that the officials of
the Unanimity can only speak one language.</i>

331
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,136
As an officer of Unanimity, I am of
course restricted from using sub speak.

332
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,429
Of course.

333
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:24,559
Please describe a typical
twenty-four hour Papa Song cycle.

334
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:30,982
At hour four, each server
is woken by auto-stimulin.

335
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:39,574
From revival, we proceed to the hygiener.

336
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:47,582
After dressing, we file into the dinery.

337
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:58,885
At hour five, we man our stations
to greet the new day's consumers.

338
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,928
Welcome to Papa Song's.

339
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,226
For the next nineteen hours,
we input orders, tray food, vend drinks,

340
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:10,272
upstock condiments, wipe tables,
and bin garbage,

341
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:13,358
all done in strict adherence
to First Catechism.

342
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:18,196
What is the First Catechism?

343
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,448
"Honor Thy Consumer."

344
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,077
After the final cleaning,

345
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:27,956
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box.

346
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,751
That is the blueprint
of every single day.

347
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:35,505
Did you ever think about the future?

348
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:41,887
Papa Song servers have
just one possible future.

349
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,723
You mean "Exultation".

350
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:47,726
Could you describe this
annual Rite of Passage?

351
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:53,815
On first day, Seer Rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars.

352
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:57,944
Twelve stars meant an end to our contract.

353
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:02,115
How did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend?

354
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,783
Excitement.

355
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,286
I was happy for them,

356
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:08,413
but envious as well.

357
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,958
Did your sister servers feel as you did?

358
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,545
Most of them.

359
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:21,301
I would like to ask about
the infamous Yoona-939.

360
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,344
If Yoona-939 woke you,
who woke her?

361
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,013
Seer Rhee.

362
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:10,183
Why would Seer wake a server?

363
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:13,436
Perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.

364
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,734
What's wrong with him?

365
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,364
He drinks soap.

366
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:27,367
It makes him happy.

367
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:33,081
Then he sleep like us in our box.

368
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:45,218
Do you ever think about... what it must
be like, up there with the consumers?

369
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:50,640
Third Catechism forbids such questions.

370
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:53,935
Yes. It does.

371
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,939
Come. Let me show you a secret.

372
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:02,694
<i>Platform four, Lost and Found.</i>

373
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:20,003
Now... Sonmia,

374
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:25,675
we are inside a secret.

375
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:31,806
A Kino?

376
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:36,436
– We are not allowed.
– Sonmia, no one will ever know.

377
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:38,271
Come.

378
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,704
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

379
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:58,166
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

380
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,103
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

381
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:10,303
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

382
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,099
You could have been excised.

383
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:17,310
How did you justify
such a risk to yourself?

384
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,854
She was my friend.

385
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:25,986
Please describe the events of
September 18th from your perspective.

386
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:29,698
I was stationed at pedestal one.

387
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:58,226
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse!

388
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:42,062
<i>Step away. Code yellow,
the area is secured.</i>

389
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:49,194
Hawaiian Islands
106 WINTERS AFTER THE FALL

390
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,199
<i>Nay, this life all rot n' lockin'
no smile a' some yawnee.</i>

391
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:59,371
<i>In rear's time, I ever fest
the secret of Sloosha's hallow.</i>

392
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:04,584
<i>Adam, my bro' by law, n' his son n' me
been trekkin' back from Honokaa Market.</i>

393
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:11,424
<i>It was Adam's custom to cult out
his ancestry with offerin's n' honorin's.</i>

394
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:25,021
<i>Suddenwise, that fangy
devil's eyes, I felt'em.</i>

395
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:30,819
Who there?

396
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:42,080
Ooh, a darky spot you're in, friend.

397
00:32:42,122 --> 00:32:43,123
Ol' Georgie...

398
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:47,138
Ain't no blade can protect you
from the True-True.

399
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:48,415
'Pa!

400
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:55,760
Jonas. Jonas, go.
Go, go!

401
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,015
Zachary!
Zachary?

402
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:01,808
Zachary!!

403
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,780
Stay here, safe here...

404
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:24,623
Kona will be feastin' on Adam
n' his boy by sunup.

405
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,298
You say it all the time, ain'ya?

406
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:37,135
"The Weak are Meat, the Strong do Eat."

407
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,271
The True-truth, what that is.

408
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,957
<i>Whole valley whisperin' about
the blood o' Adam and his son on my hands.</i>

409
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:10,752
<i>But Rose and Catkin never
believed those rumors, and stood by me.</i>

410
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:15,131
– Uncle Zach, look!
– Yeah, I see them.

411
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:19,135
<i>Prescients come batterin' twice a year,</i>

412
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,388
<i>their ships creep-crawlin' on the waves,</i>

413
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,683
<i>just floatin' on the Smart o' the Old Uns.</i>

414
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,562
Barter'll be startin' soon.

415
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:32,107
Yeah. We must go find ya' Ma.

416
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:42,200
What are you doin'?

417
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:47,122
Ma says ya ain't been
right since Sloosha's.

418
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:50,584
She say we gotta keep out our eyes on ya.

419
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,754
You mindin' me, while I mind the goats?

420
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:58,466
I see.

421
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:03,430
Stump is, who's gonna mind
your Ma at the Barter?

422
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:06,224
She got no tongue for hagglin',
not like you and me.

423
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:07,767
Sure you alright?

424
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:10,604
Swear by. Be home for suppin'.

425
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:17,903
<i>Why words slink n' slide off a tongue,
when we need them most?</i>

426
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,739
<i>If my tongue'd been more bold,</i>

427
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:24,743
<i>could I have stopped all that
diresome's about to happen?</i>

428
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:29,956
– Uncle Zach!
– Thi's my big bro I yawned you about.

429
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,627
– What's about, sis?
– Special guest hosting.

430
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:36,796
Thank you for the kindsome hostin'
in the Valley's day.

431
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:39,132
I ain't saysoe this, Rose.

432
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:43,511
– Abbess saysoe a gift of great honor.
– She can be hostin' then?

433
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,558
I brin' you gift, Zachry.

434
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,270
Need no gift from the stranger.

435
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:59,069
<i>Now kin n' bros n' half-strangers, yay,

00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,281
<i>they gaped in wonderment like
Sonmi herself was sittin' in our kitchen.</i>

<i>Questions about Prescience n' their
whoahsome Ship poured thick n'fast.</i>

438
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,915
How your ship's slidin',
glides so silent n'...

439
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,667
Fusion engines.

440
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:17,461
<i>No one queried what fusion engine was,</i>

441
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:20,590
<i>cos they didn't want to look
stupid in front o' the gatherin'.</i>

442
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,217
Fusion engines...

443

<i>True really was, Meronym
answered the questions,</i>

<i>All o' that answerin' done was
teach everyone to not trust her,</i>

<i>nay, not a flea...</i>

Schemin' and wormin' herself in.

449

Watch her, watch her close.

450
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:51,121
She's got secrets.

451
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,044
Zachry Bailey?

452
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,671
Sorrysome for wakin'

Ooh, let Sonmi guide your heart.

Ohh, I gonna hear it for us,

Ooh, Old Georgie's

Ooh, I knew it.

460

Spit a cuss on your dreams.

"Bridge is broken, hide below"

Keep her warnin' with you,
nail it to your memory.

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,904
Thank you. Thank you, Abbess.
Thank you.

468
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:17,183
Wait! Wait.

469
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:21,187
There's... no reason to hide.

470
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:27,861
I know you are... Sonmi-451.

471
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:33,241
My name is... Hae-Ju Zheng.

472
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,495
What has happened to Seer Rhee?

473
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,998
Soap overdose.

474
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:44,544
It is unfortunate that it had to happen
with everything gone so well.

475
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,379
Cos now it is probable
that the Enforcers

476
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,133
and the DNA sniffers
will find out about you.

477
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,302
And if they do...

478
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:56,473
if they realize your connection
to Yoona-939, you will be excised.

479
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:00,227
But you have a choice.

480
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:05,482
You can remain here
and risk being discovered,

481
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,694
or you can come with me.

482
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:24,793
– Bear away, boy.
– Aye, aye captain.

483
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:31,925
<i>Friday the 15th. We made sail
with the morning tide.</i>

484
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:35,512
<i>Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.</i>

485
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:40,058
<i>I have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew.</i>

486
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:44,062
<i>Henry argued in vain that the
Polynesian worm was not contagious.</i>

487
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:45,564
<i>Not that it matters.</i>

488
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:47,063
<i>All I want to do now is return home</i>

489
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:49,317
<i>and unburden myself
from this responsibility.</i>

490
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:56,199
<i>My dear Sixsmith, I am in
desperate need of your help.</i>

491
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:59,411
<i>After my last letter, I'm sure
you're rushing to pack your bags,</i>

492
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:00,996
<i>but you needn't, really.</i>

493
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:06,001
<i>Unless of course, you wish to witness
the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.</i>

494
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:14,718
<i>Is it not miraculous how one's fortune
can turn so quickly, so completely.</i>

495
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,054
<i>One moment, leaping from
a hotel window, the next</i>

496
00:41:18,138 --> 00:41:22,183
<i>gainfully employed by one of the
world's greatest living composers.</i>

497
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:26,479
<i>My only problem is that I
accidentally got hooked on a journal</i>

498
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:29,440
<i>written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage</i>

499
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:32,152
<i>from the Pacific islands
to San Francisco.</i>

500
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:35,905
<i>To my great annoyance,
the pages cease mid-sentence.</i>

501
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:39,074
<i>Half the book is missing.
It's completely killing me.</i>

502
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:41,077
<i>Could you be a mensch and when
you're next foraging</i>

503
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,121
<i>at Otto's Book's, make an inquiry?</i>

504
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:49,294
<i>A half finished book is, after all,
a half finished love affair.</i>

505
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:59,012
America loves oil.

506
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:02,557
America is addicted to oil.

507
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:07,312
Some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas.

508
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,542
But I'm here today to
tell you that the cure

509
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:16,404
for oil is right here.
The cure is nuclear power.

510
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,907
The cure is Swannekke.

511
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:31,044
<i>Hello, Miss Rey. I'm frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour.</i>

512
00:42:31,378 --> 00:42:33,255
Dr. Sixsmith?

513
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,422
<i>I need help.</i>

514
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:40,094
I need £ 50,000, not 2,000, 50,000!

515
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:42,764
<i>I'm going through it again,
Mr. Cavendish, but the total's right.</i>

516
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:45,183
<i>2,343 pounds and 16 pence.</i>

517
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:49,229
How is this possible?
The ruddy money was pouring in.

518
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:52,899
<i>Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish.
Solvency has its drawbacks.</i>

519
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:56,944
<i>The situation looked dire,</i>

520
00:42:56,945 --> 00:43:01,533
<i>but I knew that Timothy
Cavendish's capital in this town</i>

521
00:43:01,658 --> 00:43:04,619
<i>could not be defined by
an accountant's balance sheet!</i>

522
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:05,871
McCluskie!

523
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:08,790
Look, how are those
delightful kiddies of yours?

524
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,464
Mon cher, tis "Cavendish the Ravenous,"
your favorite Timothy.

525
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:18,675
Mon cher?

526
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:21,595
You heard it correctly,
Charles Dickens' own original

527
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:25,640
authentic writing desk for £ 60,000.
I think that's very fair.

528
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,351
<i>But our records indicate that the
desk is already accounted for</i>

529
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:29,853
<i>by the Dickens House Museum.</i>

530
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,772
Okay, what about
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?

531
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:44,492
<i>In the darkness, I suddenly saw the light.</i>

532
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,329
<i>Blood has always trumped water.</i>

533
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:50,832
<i>If the Hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair,</i>

534
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:56,129
<i>they'd find the Cavendish Clan
more than ready for the task at hand.</i>

535
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,926
Oh, Satan's gonads, not again.
Look,

536
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:04,346
just bugger off and leave us in peace.
I'm only gonna asking you nicely once.

537
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:05,430
Good to see you, Denny.

538
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:08,600
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot.

539
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:12,062
Why-Why should I be forever
giving you a hand out?

540
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:13,688
Denny...

541
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:16,942
I had a minor running with the wrong sort.

542
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:21,404
If I don't get my hands on £ 60,000,
I got to get an awful beating.

543
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:24,282
Well, get them to video it for us,
would you? Now fuck off.

544
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:27,827
– I'm not joking, Denholme.
– Why is this my problem?

545
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:31,164
Because we're brothers!
Don't you have a conscience?

546
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:35,627
Couple of my special little pills
and a G&T should just set me right.

547
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:38,255
Denny. Help.

548
00:44:40,757 --> 00:44:42,008
Please.

549
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:45,303
Den, who are you talking to?

550
00:44:45,762 --> 00:44:49,432
– Hello, Georgette.
– Hello, Timothy.

551
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:56,731
Right. Right, right.

552
00:44:56,773 --> 00:44:58,024
What did you-60 grand?

553
00:44:58,066 --> 00:44:59,943
It's gonna take some time, but, uh...

554
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:02,779
in the interim, I've got
the perfect place for you to hide.

555
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:10,036
<i>I begun to fear I might never hold
my beloved Tilda in my arms again.</i>

556
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:15,083
<i>My parasite writhes at night,
igniting spasms of pain,</i>

557
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,378
<i>while visions and voices,
obscene and monstrous, haunt me.</i>

558
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,255
Mister Ewing...

559
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:22,340
In the name of God!

560
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:26,136
Mister Ewing, no fear.

561
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:28,305
No harm, no shout.

562
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,600
Please.
My name Autua.

563
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:35,437
You know I... see Maori whip I...

564
00:45:36,438 --> 00:45:37,814
You know I.

565
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:44,154
– What do you want?
– You help, Mr. Ewing.

566
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:47,407
If you no help, I in trouble dead.

567
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:50,243
Well, you're already
very much "in trouble dead."

568
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:51,953
The Prophetess is a mercantile vessel,

569
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:54,372
not an underground railroad
for escaping slaves.

570
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,709
I be able seaman, I earn passage.

571
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:00,754
Well, then I suggest you surrender
to the captain's mercies forthwith.

572
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:04,132
No, no. They no hear I.

573
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:08,637
They say "swim away home, nigger",
and throw I in drink, but you...

574
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:12,515
you law man, right? Please.
Captain hear you, Mr. Ewing.

575
00:46:12,557 --> 00:46:14,517
I-I can't help you.

576
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:19,147
I'm afraid your fate is entirely
your own, and I desire no part in it.

577
00:46:20,732 --> 00:46:22,692
Then kill I.

578
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:24,569
Don't be absurd...

579
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:29,574
If you no help, you kill I just the same,
is true. You know it.

580
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:32,244
I ain't be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.

581
00:46:32,285 --> 00:46:35,914
Die here better.
Do it.

582
00:46:36,915 --> 00:46:38,708
Do it quick.

583
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,379
I found an old transway marker, Captain.

584
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:45,006
It's got to be the red mountain.

585
00:46:46,174 --> 00:46:48,301
The problem is, the valley
people are afraid of it.

586
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:50,470
They think the Devil lives up there.

587
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:54,182
I can't find anybody to guide me
through the Kona territory.

588
00:46:54,307 --> 00:46:55,850
Meronym...

589
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:59,813
Every day you're out there,
you increase your RAD levels.

590
00:46:59,938 --> 00:47:03,608
This dream of yours is going to kill you.
And for what?

591
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:06,987
The Off-World colonies
may no longer exist.

592
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:08,822
I got to go, Captain.

593
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:13,660
Thank you for coming, I'm in 1404.

594
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:15,871
<i>I'll be right up.</i>

595
00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:57,162
Dr. Sixsmith?

596
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:10,884
It's me, Luisa.

597
00:48:58,098 --> 00:49:00,767
Go call the police.
Right now, call the police!

598
00:49:37,178 --> 00:49:41,892
<i>My dear Sixsmith, you alone can
understand how I'm feeling right now.</i>

599
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:47,022
<i>Today, Ayrs and I presented our first
collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring,</i>

600
00:49:47,147 --> 00:49:49,900
<i>Ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from Berlin.</i>

601
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:54,278
<i>It's called "eternal recurrence".
Wish you could hear it.</i>

602
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:57,364
<i>It's the most accomplished tone poem
I know of written since the war,</i>

603
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:58,825
<i>and I tell you, Sixsmith,</i>

604
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:02,287
<i>that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine.</i>

605
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:13,048
At our time of life, Ayrs,
a man has no right to such daring ideas.

606
00:50:14,883 --> 00:50:20,847
I suppose I've won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude.

607
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:24,726
<i>Diner of pheasant with
Bordeaux rich as buttercream.</i>

608
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:27,519
<i>How I love to listen to men
of distinguished lives,</i>

609
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,649
<i>sing of past follies and glories.</i>

610
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:34,611
<i>The only broken note in the entire
evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta,</i>

611
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:37,322
<i>excusing herself early.</i>

612
00:50:38,156 --> 00:50:41,868
<i>Sensed the buried bone.
Later I asked Ayrs about it.</i>

613
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:45,372
<i>He said Kesselring had
introduced Jocasta to him.</i>

614
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:48,959
<i>I pried, had Kesselring
been in love with her?</i>

615
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,419
<i>The subject was a prickly one.</i>

616
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,547
Jocasta is a Jew.

617
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:56,466
Obviously her relationship was impossible.

618
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:58,260
Why obviously?

619
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:04,391
Can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in Germany?

620
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:08,478
<i>At this point in my life,
all I know, Sixsmith,</i>

621
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:13,149
<i>is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces</i>

622
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,235
<i>that twist our hearts.</i>

623
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:19,447
– How is it, Mr. Zachry?
– Thin whiles.

624
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:22,784
– Minding some company?
– Nay.

625
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,494
But...

626
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:28,999
Goats, and so do herders,
they're known for housin' temper.

627
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:33,211
Feelin' that own n' your reveal count out,

628
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:35,964
for invadin' your house with no saysoe.

629
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:37,799
True sorrysome.

630
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:41,136
Well it... Now it's done.

631
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:46,683
So, you mindin' a stranger
coverin' about your thrivin'?

632
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:49,936
Swap you. Query for query.

633
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,690
Fair buy.

634
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:58,111
Cog you and come dow.
Learn stitchin' n' milkin' our heardin'.

635
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:01,489
Why you here?

636
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,034
I needin' a guide.

637
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,995
Guide? To where?

638
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:10,290
Mauna Sol.

639
00:52:17,756 --> 00:52:20,800
<i>"Bridge is broken, hide below"</i>

640
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:24,304
What's wrong?

641
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:58,004
<i>We cross and recross
our old tracks like figure skaters.</i>

642
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:01,007
<i>And just as I was reading
a new submission,</i>

643
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:04,177
<i>a powerful déjà-vu ran through my bones.</i>

644
00:53:06,221 --> 00:53:08,807
<i>I had been here before.</i>

645
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:11,560
<i>Another lifetime ago.</i>

646
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:14,312
<i>Ursula.</i>

647
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:18,316
<i>The love of my life.</i>

648
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:21,194
<i>I could think of no other
serious applicants.</i>

649
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:24,531
<i>What had happened to her?</i>

650
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:26,616
<i>And more importantly,</i>

651
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:28,702
<i>what had happened to the young man</i>

652
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:32,163
<i>who had ridden the same train
composing sonnets,</i>

653
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:35,458
<i>to his so bound a love.</i>

654
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,794
Your augurin' come true, Abbess.

655
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,712
Broke bridge, just like you say.

656
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:43,008
Meronym were there, yebberin' about
trackin' up Mauna Sol,

657
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:46,261
why can this Prescient woman
come cursin' n' twistin' on my life?

658
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:48,722
Mind the words of Sonmi.

659
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:54,936
"Our lives are not our own.

660
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:59,566
From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.

661
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:04,154
Past and present.

662
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:08,366
And by each crime...

663
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,954
and every kindness...

664
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,874
we birth our future."

665
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,135
Welcome to Neo Seoul.

666
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:41,399
Come on, out you come.

667
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:45,444
This... maybe the biggest mistake
of my life, but here.

668
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:47,530
Thank you, Mr. Ewing.

669
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:53,410
Now to tell the truth, I was
worried you might try and eat me,

670
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:55,247
if you didn't get
something in the stomach.

671
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,707
Oh, you safe, Mr. Ewing.

672
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:59,709
I no like white meat.

673
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:03,838
Ah. Right.

674
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:08,426
Before I decide what
I'm going to do with you,

675
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:12,597
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely?

676
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:15,225
My uncle was a sailor.

677
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,603
He took me on a French whaler
when I was ten years old.

678
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,939
Seen too much of the world.

679
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:23,441
I no good slave.

680
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:27,153
Why did you look at me?

681
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,574
Pain strong, aye.

682
00:55:31,366 --> 00:55:33,493
Friend's eye more strong.

683
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:38,039
Look, you are a runaway slave,
and I am a lawyer.

684
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:41,334
How did you imagine
we could possibly be friends?

685
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:48,008
All you need.

686
00:55:58,476 --> 00:55:59,811
Ah, Jesus!

687
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:02,755
Javier Gomez, what did I tell you
about jumping onto my balcony?

688
00:56:02,778 --> 00:56:05,316
Why d'you leave the door open
if you don't want me to come in?

689
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:06,401
Because, smarty pants,

690
00:56:06,526 --> 00:56:09,069
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony,

691
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,449
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony, and being stuck out there.

692
00:56:12,532 --> 00:56:13,658
Okay!

693
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,620
What are you reading?

694
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:21,374
Old letters.

695
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:27,214
<i>Sixsmith, the plot has
taken a sensual turn.</i>

696
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:30,549
<i>Last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.</i>

697
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:34,554
<i>But don't alarm yourself, it is only
a carnal act, performed in service,</i>

698
00:56:34,888 --> 00:56:37,390
<i>not unlike my role as amanuensis.</i>

699
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:43,730
<i>And I confess women's hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me.</i>

700
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:51,279
<i>Afterward, she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home.</i>

701
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:55,242
<i>I can get clear that Vyvyan
had been there the entire night,</i>

702
00:56:55,367 --> 00:57:00,580
<i>between us like the silence between notes,
that holds the key to warm music.</i>

703
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:06,294
<i>P.S.: Best news of all,</i>

704
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:08,922
<i>I've started my own work.</i>

705
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:18,807
Uh, I... called about an old recording,

706
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:21,977
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.

707
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:24,729
Oops. Busted.

708
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:27,565
I know I shouldn't be playing it, I was...

709
00:57:27,566 --> 00:57:29,734
checking it to make sure
it wasn't scratched,

710
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:33,195
but... honestly,

711
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:35,365
I just can't stop listening to it.

712
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,742
This is the Cloud Atlas Sextet?

713
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:41,454
It's... the symphony.

714
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:48,795
It's beautiful.

715
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,213
but I think I've heard this before.

716
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:53,550
I can't imagine how.

717
00:57:53,675 --> 00:57:57,804
I doubt there's no more than a... handful
copies in the whole of North America.

718
00:57:57,929 --> 00:57:59,472
But I know it.

719
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:03,560
I know I know it.

720
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:10,066
<i>Before I realized it, my feet had brought
me back to the Temple of Sacrifice,</i>

721
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:12,444
<i>where I offered up my virginity.</i>

722
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:15,322
<i>Back to those four-days of Paradise,</i>

723
00:58:15,363 --> 00:58:19,117
<i>when Ursula's Mater and Pater
slift off to Greece,</i>

724
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:21,119
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

725
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:26,666
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

726
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,628
Ursula!

727
00:58:33,298 --> 00:58:37,260
Sir! Madam! I assure you
this is completely innocent...

728
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:44,476
<i>Two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.</i>

729
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,938
<i>Official cause of accident,
listed on hospital form...</i>

730
00:58:48,063 --> 00:58:49,022
<i>pussy.</i>

731
00:58:53,026 --> 00:58:56,529
<i>What were the chances that
she still lived in this house?</i>

732
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:00,909
<i>And yet, there she was.</i>

733
00:59:01,743 --> 00:59:03,078
<i>Ursula.</i>

734
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:07,791
<i>Why had I never returned
her calls or letters?</i>

735
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:12,879
<i>Shame, spinessless,
hallmarks of the Cavendish clan.</i>

736
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:19,261
<i>I realized I had a choice. I could
slink off and continue as planned,</i>

737
00:59:19,386 --> 00:59:21,399
<i>or I could go boldly to the door,

738
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:24,391
 and discover what hope,
if any, would lay within.</i>

739
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:28,228
Abbess, come quick,
it's the Bailey girl.

740
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:30,397
– Catkin?
– Aye, she dyin'.

741
00:59:34,856 --> 00:59:36,676
– What-what...
– Zach.

742
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,867
– Sonmi...
– It's scorpion fish.

743
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:46,288
Healer said she be gone by sundown.

744
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:49,583
Ain't right, ain't fair,
but nothing to be done.

745
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,427
Be very still.

746
01:00:00,552 --> 01:00:03,305
Termination charge.
Here!

747
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:07,392
Just enough to blow your carotid.

748
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:35,795
How does it feel?

749
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,341
Good.

750
01:00:43,136 --> 01:00:44,763
Catkin's dying!

751
01:00:45,764 --> 01:00:47,682
– What?
– She trod on a scorpion fish.

752
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,186
You can save her.
You got spesh smart in that gearbag,

753
01:00:52,187 --> 01:00:54,814
that'll save her.
That's the True-true!

754
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,109
Prescient Councils swear
by a special order.

755
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:01,195
Say I can't go play Lady Sonmi
for everythin' twistin' wrong,

756
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:04,199
and click fingers, make right.

757
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:07,451
I just a stupid goat herder but
I cog you're killin' Catkin by not actin',

758
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:11,248
just... by lettin' you up on that bridge,
you Kona meat.

759
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:17,462
If a Prescient be layin',
with poison meltin' her heart n'lungs?

760
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,548
If it be your kin?

761
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:23,718
Why the Precient's life worth
more than a Valleysman?!

762
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:35,772
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.

763
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:37,983
I know the way!

764
01:01:38,024 --> 01:01:40,110
If you save Catkin,

765
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:44,322
I will guide you to the Devil's door,
if that's where you wanna go.

766
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:54,249
<i>While the past may call to us

767
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:58,795
<i>better, I believed, to stay
the course set by dear brother Den.</i>

768
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,922

This way.

771
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,438
Come.

772
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:32,120
<i>Designating texture.</i>

773
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:46,343
That's old Seoul.

774
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:49,512
If the tides keep rising
at their present rate,

775
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:52,390
Neo-Seoul will also be under
water in a hundred years.

776
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:28,843
Your food is in here.

777
01:03:29,636 --> 01:03:33,056
It's not what you're used to,
but I think you will like it.

778
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:35,976
This is your bed...

779
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:39,396
These are your clothes.

780
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:47,612
Mine? But these are...
Pureblood clothes.

781
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:50,156
No. They are yours.

782
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:53,451
Did you know he was Union?

783
01:03:53,577 --> 01:03:56,413
No, but it wouldn't have mattered.

784
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:58,373
Why not?

785
01:03:58,498 --> 01:04:00,208
Because...

786
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:04,379
It was the first time
a Pureblood had showed me kindness.

787
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,638
I hungry.

788
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:40,207
Do you like them?

789
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:44,419
You look lovely.

790
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:47,005
Here...

791
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,133
Come here.

792
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:55,388
Now, this used to play Vidis,
but the chip is corrupted.

793
01:04:55,513 --> 01:04:59,100
Stuck in a loop, so I digit it
and found the rest of it.

794
01:04:59,226 --> 01:05:00,852
The rest of it?

795
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,610
...the bloody hell are
you doing in my room?

796
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:26,336
Keys... go walkies, let's give these
to Miss Judd for safekeeping, shall we?

797
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:29,798
Leave my things alone,
you pilvering cow.

798
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:35,762
Cause you're new, I shall not make
you eat soap powder, this time...

799
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:36,888
You're warned.

800
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:41,101
I cannot stand for offensive language
in our arrays, not from anyone.

801
01:05:41,226 --> 01:05:44,729
And I never make idle threats,
Mr. Cavendish. Never.

802
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:47,983
I'll talk to you as I ruddy
will like, you thief!

803
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:51,861
Make me eat soap powder?
I'd like to see you try.

804
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:55,156
Ooh, bloody hell!

805
01:05:56,116 --> 01:05:58,785
A disappointing start.

806
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,581
Is this some sort of kinky S&M hotel?

807
01:06:02,706 --> 01:06:07,794
I am nurse Noakes,
you do not wish to cross me.

808
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:18,138
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
Uh, I know it's a Miss...

809
01:06:18,263 --> 01:06:19,389
Rey.

810
01:06:19,514 --> 01:06:23,143
– Luisa Rey, Spyglass magazine.
– Right, right.

811
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,980
Luisa, this is Joe Napier,
our security chief.

812
01:06:27,105 --> 01:06:29,316
I was surprised to get your query.

813
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:32,485
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it-it is a feisty magazine, but...

814
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:34,404
Anything you need,
sir, just let me know.

815
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:37,032
We'll do. Guys, I'm good,
thank you very much.

816
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,451
Our editor's trying to
spice things up a little bit,

817
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:42,913
he says the public wants
more substance, so...

818
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:44,331
Probably just a fad.

819
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:49,044
Come on, follow me, let's start
you with the Chicken Ranch.

820
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:50,962
That is where we keep the Eggheads.

821
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:04,517
Hello, Mr. Cavendish,
feeling super this morning?

822
01:07:04,643 --> 01:07:09,189
No. I checked in last night,
believing that Aurora House was a hotel.

823
01:07:09,314 --> 01:07:13,276
My brother made the booking you see,
his idea of a practical joke.

824
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:17,489
But listen, you have a bigger problem
closer to home.

825
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:20,991
There's some demented bitch
calling herself Noakes,

826
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:25,038
rampaging about the place,
impersonating a chamber maid.

827
01:07:25,664 --> 01:07:30,877
But the point is this:
she struck me, and she stole my keys.

828
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:36,633
Right? I'll need those
keys back, straight away.

829
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:41,763
Aurora House is your home now,
Mr. Cavendish. Your signature

830
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:44,266
– authorizes us to apply...
– Signature?

831
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:47,602
The custody document
you signed last night.

832
01:07:47,727 --> 01:07:49,688
Your residency papers.

833
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:53,316
Oh no, no, no. That was
the hotel register.

834
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:56,278
Ah, never mind, it's all academic, huh?

835
01:07:56,403 --> 01:07:59,072
This is gonna make a hell
of a diner party story.

836
01:07:59,114 --> 01:08:02,617
Most of our guests get cold feet
on their first mornings.

837
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:04,661
– My keys, please.

838
01:08:04,703 --> 01:08:08,123
– Residents are not...
– I'm not a ruddy resident!

839
01:08:08,248 --> 01:08:11,167
You'll find temper tantrums
won't help you at Aurora House!

840
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:14,170
You're breaking the... ruddy...

841
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:19,134
acting... conservation act,
or some ruddy thing,

842
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:22,762
and I will not be subjugated
to a criminal abuse.

843
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:29,728
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

844
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:41,031
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes
are forming on slate roofs.</i>

845
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:47,412
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

846
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:52,125
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

847
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:02,219
Off somewhere?

848
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:05,889
You bet I am.
To the land of the living.

849
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:14,689
Soylent Green is people.
Soylent Green is made of people!

850
01:09:16,608 --> 01:09:19,069
Oy! Get back here, you!

851
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:23,906
You keep away from me, or
I'll be forced to name you,

852
01:09:23,907 --> 01:09:25,909
in the police report, as an accomplice.

853
01:09:26,034 --> 01:09:27,786
I have better things to do than this.

854
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:32,332
Then go, pit and do them,
you bloody sucker son of...

855
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:35,502
Right!

856
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:42,217
God, you take hands off me,
you ruddy bloody...

857
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:50,016
You can maintain power over people,
as long as you give them something.

858
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:55,188
Rob a man of everything, and that
man will no longer be in your power.

859
01:09:56,022 --> 01:10:00,151
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
20th century philosopher complete works,

860
01:10:00,402 --> 01:10:02,612
banned by Unanimity.

861
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:05,448
How do you know about him?

862
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:06,866
Hae-Ju.

863
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:13,081
– Sir Zheng.
– Please, you must call me Hae-Ju.

864
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:15,417
Hae-Ju...

865
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:20,964
Fabricants can be excised for this...

866
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:25,093
Well, survival often demands some courage.

867
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:45,655
<i>Knowledge is a mirror,
and for the first time in my life,</i>

868
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:50,744
<i>I was allowed to see who I was,
and who I might become.</i>

869
01:10:58,376 --> 01:11:00,295
Go clean the head.

870
01:11:01,546 --> 01:11:02,839
Good morning, captain.

871
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,010
You can help it remain so,
Quillcock, by buggering off.

872
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:09,596
I'm afraid I can't do it, sir.

873
01:11:09,721 --> 01:11:12,765
If I was, I would be unable
to inform you of the stow-away

874
01:11:12,766 --> 01:11:14,935
– that I have discovered in my...
– Stow-away?

875
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:17,562
I assure you that this
Moriori had no choice.

876
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:21,233
Now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class, able bodied seaman,

877
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:23,610
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance.

878
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:29,032
A stow-away is a stow-away,
even if he shits silver nuggets.

879
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:33,995
Did he ever explain anything to you?

880
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:39,793
He told me their goal was
the creation of a free willed Fabricant.

881
01:11:41,503 --> 01:11:43,547
Yoona had failed.

882
01:11:44,297 --> 01:11:46,383
I was their last hope.

883
01:11:50,929 --> 01:11:54,640
I have to say if all lady
journalists look like you,

884
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:58,937
I might start to take this, uh,
women's lib thing more seriously.

885
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:01,982
Well, I'm sure they can use your support.

886
01:12:03,233 --> 01:12:04,526
Nice.

887
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,780
Okay, uh, you wait here and I will
go find someone smarter who can, uh,

888
01:12:08,822 --> 01:12:11,241
walk you through the details
of some of your questions.

889
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,450
Great.

890
01:12:32,387 --> 01:12:33,847
What would Dad do?

891
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:45,650
Who the bloody hell is this?
Have you any idea what time it is?

892
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:48,194
– Denny, it's me, Tim.
<i>- Timothee?</i>

893
01:12:49,696 --> 01:12:50,739
Where are you?

894
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:54,034
<i>Ah, I think you ruddy know
about where I am.</i>

895
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,620
But residents are
denied access to phones.

896
01:12:56,703 --> 01:12:58,038
<i>Someone smuggled one in?</i>

897
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,833
– You know the rules?
<i>- I helped write them, Timmy.</i>

898
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:05,295
<i>I have been a principal investor
in Aurora House for twelve years,</i>

899
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,588
it's incredibly lucrative.

900
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:10,175
You can't believe what people would pay
to lock-out their parents.

901
01:13:11,927 --> 01:13:13,595
Look, Den, you've had your fun,

902
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:17,182
I think it's high time you put an end
to this little game of yours.

903
01:13:17,307 --> 01:13:21,811
No, no, no, Timmy.
My fun has just begun.

904
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:23,355
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

905
01:13:23,356 --> 01:13:26,024
I am your brother, why are
you doing this to me?

906
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:30,779
<i>I think the better question is-would be,
what have you done to deserve this?</i>

907
01:13:30,904 --> 01:13:32,447
I don't know what you mean.

908
01:13:32,572 --> 01:13:35,200
Oh come, naughty old brother,
don't insult me.

909
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:38,703
You can't think that I didn't know
about you and Georgette!

910
01:13:40,163 --> 01:13:41,456
Georgette?

911
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:46,503
Look, Den...

912
01:13:46,628 --> 01:13:48,547
I didn't mean to hurt you.

913
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:51,257
I'm afraid your penance
has come due, Timbo,

914
01:13:51,258 --> 01:13:53,510
it's time to account for your crimes.

915
01:13:54,135 --> 01:13:55,303
Den...

916
01:13:55,971 --> 01:13:58,598
– I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

917
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,934
<i>- No no no, there's
no need to apologize.</i>

918
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:03,520
<i>Your exile is more than enough reparation.</i>

919
01:14:03,645 --> 01:14:07,941
Oh, I do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you,

920
01:14:07,983 --> 01:14:10,178
nurse Noakes and a broom handle.

921
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:12,382
Cherry up, Timmy.
Bye bye now.

922
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,740
He sends his love.

923
01:14:26,334 --> 01:14:29,087
I would like to ask about
the night of your arrest.

924
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:34,593
I remember...
listening to his heart beat.

925
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:39,180
Your heart beats much slower than ours.

926
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,351
There is a gentleness to the sound.

927
01:14:43,476 --> 01:14:46,646
I find it... comforting.

928
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:52,652
– Vyvyan, what time is it?
– I don't know. Who cares...

929
01:14:52,777 --> 01:14:55,864
I've heard a melody, boy.
For violin.

930
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:57,282
Quick...

931
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,242
Find-find a pen.

932
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,831
I heard it in a dream.
I was in a nightmarish café...

933
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:09,628
Blaring, bright lights,
but underground and no way out.

934
01:15:11,254 --> 01:15:15,717
And the waitresses...
they all had the same face.

935
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:20,847
There was music playing, not like
any music I've ever heard in my life.

936
01:15:24,559 --> 01:15:29,022
It began...
It began...

937
01:15:29,147 --> 01:15:30,398
Wait...

938
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:35,654
It was so clear a minute ago.

939
01:15:37,155 --> 01:15:40,492
Help me, Robert, help me.
It's slipping away!

940
01:15:42,827 --> 01:15:44,079
I've lost it.

941
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:47,123
It'll come to you, sir.

942
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:50,544
The minute you stop trying
to find it, it will find you.

943
01:15:50,669 --> 01:15:52,587
You are naive, Robert.

944
01:15:55,757 --> 01:15:57,592
I am anything but.

945
01:15:57,717 --> 01:16:00,554
There is a gulf between these chairs.

946
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:03,765
What you want is no different
from what I want.

947
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,185
The gulf is an illusion.

948
01:16:08,562 --> 01:16:11,481
<i>How do I describe that night, Sixsmith...</i>

949
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:16,027
<i>What had happened between
Vyvyan and I transcended language.</i>

950
01:16:17,237 --> 01:16:21,324
<i>It was music that poured from his eyes,
and breathed from his lips.</i>

951
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:27,122
<i>Music as beautiful as any
I have ever heard.</i>

952
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:35,130
What-what are you doing in here?

953
01:16:39,342 --> 01:16:40,844
They found us.

954
01:17:08,163 --> 01:17:11,791
I'll be with you the whole way,
now focus on me.

955
01:17:17,881 --> 01:17:19,758
Stay with me.

956
01:17:20,258 --> 01:17:22,886
Right here.
I won't let you go.

957
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:42,948
– Mr. Ewing.
– It-It's alright.

958
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:45,825
I-I talked to the captain,
he'll hear your case.

959
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:47,619
What's your name, boy?

960
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:50,580
Autua, sir.

961
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:53,917
This Christian gentleman,
who knows nothing about ships,

962
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:57,337
tells me that you're a first-class sailor.

963
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:02,133
Very well, let's see you'd
lower the main top, son.

964
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:10,225
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.

965
01:18:20,694 --> 01:18:23,321
Mr. Boerhaave, ready my piece.

966
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:28,159
What? Sir, you...
gave me your word, Captain.

967
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:30,412
P-Please, you can't do this.

968
01:18:30,537 --> 01:18:34,374
Nobody tells me what I can
and cannot do on my own ship.

969
01:18:34,499 --> 01:18:37,085
Specially when it concerns
nigger stow-away.

970
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:06,697
Captain look!
He's got fish-hooks for toes.

971
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:09,659
Boerhaave, you don't
make a mess of my deck.

972
01:19:44,778 --> 01:19:46,696
Captain, please...

973
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,118
Look, if you can just hear me, I'm...

974
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:13,223
The darkie's salt as I am.

975
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,310
Mr. Boerhaave!

976
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,854
It appears we have an
addition to our crew.

977
01:20:20,855 --> 01:20:22,482
Make sure he earns his keep.

978
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:26,194
Mr. Hooks.

979
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:32,117
I found her. She was in the chem labs,
looking for the bathroom.

980
01:20:32,993 --> 01:20:37,998
Ah? Well, perfect, then, uh, why don't
you take over from here, Sachs,

981
01:20:38,081 --> 01:20:40,667
you know, introduce our
little tribe, and uh...

982
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,712
and guide Ms. Rey through the...
through the tower.

983
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:47,424
The funny thing is, I am not
even supposed to be here.

984
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:51,135
I was meant to be in Seoul,
but the air traffic controller strike

985
01:20:51,136 --> 01:20:54,722
put everything up, so now
I'm on the... time jumper tonight.

986
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:58,018
Did you ever think that
the universe was against you?

987
01:20:58,143 --> 01:20:59,603
All the time.

988
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,105
You mind?

989
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,232
I'm cool.

990
01:21:17,245 --> 01:21:19,664
You seem nervous, Isaac.

991
01:21:19,789 --> 01:21:21,666
– Do I make you nervous?
– No.

992
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:25,045
Actually, just the opposite.

993
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:46,483
Will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me?

994
01:21:52,322 --> 01:21:57,285
<i>Freedom. The fatuous jingle
of our civilization.</i>

995
01:21:57,953 --> 01:22:02,582
<i>But only those deprived of it have
the barest inkling of what it really is.</i>

996
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,980
There's much disagreement
on what should be done with you.

997
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:28,608
The Corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant,

998
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:31,528
the Manufacturer is
demanding a period of study,

999
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:35,782
the Pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection.

1000
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:42,789
However, the problem you
create is a political one.

1001
01:22:45,292 --> 01:22:48,670
Which means you are my problem.

1002
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:54,467
I find it intriguing
to imagine that beneath this...

1003
01:22:54,551 --> 01:23:00,599
perfectly engineered features, are thoughts
that terrify the whole of Unanimity.

1004
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:09,232
I'm not afraid of such thoughts,
because I do not fear the truth.

1005
01:23:10,817 --> 01:23:15,030
There's a natural order
to this world, fabricant.

1006
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:19,701
And the truth is this order
must be protected.

1007
01:23:31,796 --> 01:23:35,508
Inform the Archivist,
prepare for excisement.

1008
01:23:35,634 --> 01:23:37,594
– Yes sir.
– Sir...

1009
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:43,892
Can you tell me what
happened to Hae-Ju Zheng?

1010
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:47,270
Killed, I was told.

1011
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:12,488
All this feast and excitements,
really Adam, it's...

1012
01:24:12,503 --> 01:24:15,173
all too much, you'll need to rest.

1013
01:24:29,104 --> 01:24:30,939
I had...

1014
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:37,279
a girlfriend once, she kept trying
to get me to read Carlos Castenada.

1015
01:24:37,404 --> 01:24:40,156
– You ever read any o' that shit?
– Oh yeah.

1016
01:24:42,576 --> 01:24:45,203
But the relationship was doomed.

1017
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:47,372
Every time she brought up a new...

1018
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:51,167
karma, past-life stuff,
I-I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

1019
01:24:53,378 --> 01:24:54,421
And yet...

1020
01:24:55,964 --> 01:24:58,633
I can't explain it...

1021
01:24:58,758 --> 01:25:02,095
but I knew when I opened that door...

1022
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:18,069
They destroyed most of
the copies of the report.

1023
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:21,865
Most?

1024
01:25:24,993 --> 01:25:27,704
There's no good choice here, is there?

1025
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:30,957
If I help you, I can lose my job...

1026
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:32,334
or worse,

1027
01:25:34,377 --> 01:25:38,173
If I don't, a lot of people...

1028
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:42,427
Yeah, it will be worse than worse.

1029
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:47,265
You have to do...

1030
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:49,893
whatever you can't not do.

1031
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:58,818
Someone preyin' on you, Zachry?

1032
01:25:59,903 --> 01:26:02,822
You really ain't feary about meetin'
Ol' Georgie on the summit?

1033
01:26:02,948 --> 01:26:06,076
I'm more scaresome 'bout
the weather than in the Devil.

1034
01:26:09,746 --> 01:26:11,456
You cog he's real?

1035
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:14,918
Who tripped the Fall,
if not Old Georgie?

1036
01:26:17,003 --> 01:26:18,505
True-true?

1037
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:24,261
The Old Uns.

1038
01:26:25,136 --> 01:26:27,222
That's just a rope o'smoke.

1039
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:29,849
Old Uns got the Smart.

1040
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,144
They mastered sick and seeds,

1041
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,605
they make miracles and fly across the sky.

1042
01:26:35,647 --> 01:26:39,150
True. All true.
But they got somethin' else.

1043
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:43,613
A hunger in their hearts, a hunger
that's stronger than all their Smart.

1044
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:47,033
Hunger? For what?

1045
01:26:48,827 --> 01:26:50,287
A hunger for more.

1046
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:55,584
<i>Belief like fear or love</i>

1047
01:26:55,625 --> 01:27:00,463
<i>is a force to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity,</i>

1048
01:27:00,547 --> 01:27:02,883
and principles of uncertainty.

1049
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:07,429
<i>Phenomena that determine
the course of our lives.</i>

1050
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:13,226
<i>Yesterday, my life was
headed in one direction.</i>

1051
01:27:16,438 --> 01:27:20,317
<i>Today, it is headed in another.</i>

1052
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:26,573
<i>Yesterday, I believed I would never
have done what I did today.</i>

1053
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:30,619
<i>These forces that often
remake time and space,</i>

1054
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:34,247
<i>they can shape and alter
who we imagine ourselves to be,</i>

1055
01:27:34,372 --> 01:27:39,252
<i>begin long before we are born,
and continue after we perish.</i>

1056
01:27:44,299 --> 01:27:47,427
<i>Our lives and our choices</i>

1057
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:52,933
<i>like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment</i>

1058
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:58,188
<i>at each point of intersection,

1059
01:27:58,313 --> 01:28:02,525
<i>suggest a new potential direction.</i>

1060
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:07,072
<i>Proposition:</i>

1061
01:28:07,197 --> 01:28:10,450
<i>I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.</i>

1062
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:17,541
<i>Is this possible?
I just met her, and yet...</i>

1063
01:28:17,624 --> 01:28:23,630
<i>I feel like something important
has happened to me.</i>

1064
01:28:33,974 --> 01:28:35,433
That's it.

1065
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:37,978
The music from my dream.

1066
01:29:19,978 --> 01:29:24,608
This is from my dream,
that night I came to your room.

1067
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:29,404
This is the music I heard in my head,
somehow I gave it to you.

1068
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:32,198
I've been working on
this piece for weeks now.

1069
01:29:32,324 --> 01:29:36,494
I suspect you heard it, and
incorporated it into your dream.

1070
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:40,123
I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

1071
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:47,797
This is obviously the result
of our collaboration.

1072
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:51,760
The Atlas, I believe,

1073
01:29:51,927 --> 01:29:55,013
is the only thing I've done
in my life that is of value.

1074
01:29:56,848 --> 01:29:59,309
But I know I could not have written it,

1075
01:30:00,644 --> 01:30:03,021
if I hadn't met you.

1076
01:30:03,146 --> 01:30:06,816
There are whole movements in
the Atlas that I wrote imagining us,

1077
01:30:06,942 --> 01:30:11,404
meeting again and again,
in different lives and different ages.

1078
01:30:11,446 --> 01:30:12,572
Yes...

1079
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:20,580
Something as important as this
cannot be described as "yours" or "mine",

1080
01:30:20,956 --> 01:30:22,916
it is "ours".

1081
01:30:29,589 --> 01:30:31,800
That this is exactly how I feel, Vyvyan.

1082
01:30:52,445 --> 01:30:53,947
I'm sorry, I...

1083
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:58,702
– I thought...
– You thought? You thought what?

1084
01:30:58,827 --> 01:31:04,791
That I might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself?

1085
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:09,838
I pack my bag, and be gone by morning.

1086
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,799
You'll do no such thing, you'll leave
only when I say you can leave.

1087
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:17,387
You will continue working
on Vyvyan Ayrs' Cloud Atlas.

1088
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:20,473
When it is finished, then I will
decide what to do with you.

1089
01:31:20,515 --> 01:31:22,934
You can't keep me here!
I'm leaving!

1090
01:31:23,059 --> 01:31:26,645
Good luck with your composing.
I'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself

1091
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:29,524
is still capable of something
completely immemorable.

1092
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:34,321
I suggest you think about this, Robert.
Think about reputation.

1093
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:40,869
Reputation is everything in our society.
Yours, my disinherited reprobate,

1094
01:31:40,994 --> 01:31:42,829
has expired.

1095
01:31:42,954 --> 01:31:47,042
Did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof?

1096
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:50,212
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:

1097
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:54,925
"He is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites

1098
01:31:55,133 --> 01:31:59,888
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at Caius.

1099
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:04,309
Lock up the silverware."
Unquote.

1100
01:32:06,645 --> 01:32:10,023
Be warned.
Leave here without my consent,

1101
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:15,946
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.

1102
01:32:17,155 --> 01:32:19,115
After that,

1103
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:23,912
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written,

1104
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,248
no one will hear it,

1105
01:32:26,748 --> 01:32:30,460
because no one will want
anything to do with you.

1106
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,168
I won't let you go again.

1107
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:20,677
I told you he'd come.

1108
01:33:21,219 --> 01:33:22,971
<i>Two things became clear.</i>

1109
01:33:23,096 --> 01:33:27,058
<i>Hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite</i>

1110
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,894
<i>plunder my talent a day longer.</i>

1111
01:33:29,185 --> 01:33:31,438
<i>I must complete my sextet.</i>

1112
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:34,357
<i>I can't do it here,
so tonight I plan to make my escape.</i>

1113
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,623
<i>Please stand by for vehicle scan.</i>

1114
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:54,002
<i>Clearance granted.</i>

1115
01:34:12,979 --> 01:34:15,899
Any jailbreak's a risky proposition.

1116
01:34:16,024 --> 01:34:20,612
One little cock-up, and we are
dangling at her majesty's pleasure.

1117
01:34:20,737 --> 01:34:22,822
I know, I know.

1118
01:34:22,906 --> 01:34:24,908
We could use code names,

1119
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:28,161
but the truth is I'd probably
be the first to forget mine.

1120
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:31,373
So, Mr. Cavendish...

1121
01:34:31,957 --> 01:34:33,833
Ernie Blancksmith.

1122
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:39,005
This is Mr. Meeks
and my girl Veronica Costello.

1123
01:34:39,839 --> 01:34:42,717
– To trust.
– To trust.

1124
01:34:43,718 --> 01:34:46,805
I know, I know.

1125
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:50,392
What about the parrot, then?

1126
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:52,310
If ever that was a likely songbird.

1127
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:57,107
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman, he would never betray us.

1128
01:34:57,232 --> 01:35:00,443
Besides, no one's ever heard
him say anything else.

1129
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:02,654
I know, I know.

1130
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:05,323
Question is, old man,

1131
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:07,450
think you're up to snuff?

1132
01:35:22,549 --> 01:35:24,426
<i>Unanimity requires compliance.</i>

1133
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,721
<i>We have a security code Red,
prepare to be boarded.</i>

1134
01:35:27,846 --> 01:35:29,806
What are you going to do?

1135
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:32,058
Stay calm, stay calm.

1136
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:36,813
<i>" It will end in tears."
You've warned me.</i>

1137
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:39,107
<i>I suppose I'm as hopeless
as Adam Ewing,</i>

1138
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:42,359
<i>oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting,</i>

1139
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,779
<i>blind to the fact his friend
is poisoning him.</i>

1140
01:35:44,821 --> 01:35:46,489
Wait, please...

1141
01:35:46,531 --> 01:35:49,117
The idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure.

1142
01:35:49,242 --> 01:35:50,535
Don't be a silly puff here, Adam,

1143
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:54,289
I'm sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop.

1144
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:59,169
I have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight!

1145
01:36:00,962 --> 01:36:04,298
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith,
who works with such alacrity,

1146
01:36:04,299 --> 01:36:07,427
that your Tilda may not have
to know this was ever removed.

1147
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:12,724
– Give it to me!
– Get your fucking hands off my pudding!

1148
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:15,685
It's not your pudding, you
Alzheimer riddled lout!

1149
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:17,270
You've already eaten...

1150
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:26,321
Better get in here.

1151
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:48,468
Mr. Cavendish!

1152
01:36:57,602 --> 01:37:00,855
<i>The room stank of bitter medicine.</i>

1153
01:37:07,112 --> 01:37:10,030
<i>Curiously heavy things, guns.</i>

1154
01:37:10,031 --> 01:37:12,826
Why did I take it, exactly?

1155
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,078
<i>Can't say.</i>

1156
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:16,621
<i>An intuition.</i>

1157
01:37:16,746 --> 01:37:18,915
<i>A sense of significance.</i>

1158
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,751
<i>That from this point on...</i>

1159
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:25,046
<i>there was no going back.</i>

1160
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:46,735
Just seein' them clouds,
we run out o' time.

1161
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:56,328
– Don't need no smart rope.
– Yeah, see you fall,

1162
01:37:57,078 --> 01:37:58,955
I'll catch you.

1163
01:38:14,721 --> 01:38:17,432
Hands in the air. Now!
Move it, step off of the vehicle!

1164
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:20,894
Get down.
Down, now!

1165
01:38:24,564 --> 01:38:26,775
Fuckin' migrant monkey-talk.

1166
01:38:27,275 --> 01:38:29,903
Why do they hire these greasy stubs?

1167
01:38:30,987 --> 01:38:32,781
Negative, sir.
Definite illegal.

1168
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:34,199
You turn him from now.

1169
01:38:34,866 --> 01:38:36,201
I'm reading a second life form!

1170
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:37,869
– Where?
– In the truck.

1171
01:38:37,994 --> 01:38:40,205
– Check it out.
– Yes, sir.

1172
01:39:11,903 --> 01:39:16,283
You troddin' on the Devil's ground now,

1173
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:17,784
Valleysman.

1174
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:26,501
I'm sayin' just once.
That off-lander ain't gettin' to the top.

1175
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:31,673
Time for you to let go that rope.

1176
01:39:31,798 --> 01:39:33,466
You trespass...

1177
01:39:34,092 --> 01:39:35,760
You pay the price.

1178
01:39:37,512 --> 01:39:40,098
Now drop that rope.

1179
01:39:40,223 --> 01:39:43,685
Drop that rope.

1180
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:48,273
– Forcecom 1, entering the truck.
– Roger that.

1181
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:50,400
I turn in visual.

1182
01:39:51,985 --> 01:39:54,237
– It's her!
– It'll be okay, uh?

1183
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:13,465
Fire at me.
Fire at me!

1184
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:31,775
Who are you?

1185
01:40:32,317 --> 01:40:33,818
Commander Hae-Ju Zheng.

1186
01:40:34,861 --> 01:40:38,073
First science officer
of the Union rebellion.

1187
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:40,742
Why are you doing this?

1188
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:44,621
Because I believe you have
the power to change this world.

1189
01:40:45,038 --> 01:40:49,960
<i>Drop that rope...
Let go that rope.</i>

1190
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:52,879
<i>"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"</i>

1191
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:57,008
Hands are bleedin'.
Can't let go.

1192
01:41:10,855 --> 01:41:12,357
Thank you Zachry.

1193
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:15,860
You savin' me twice, ain't ya?

1194
01:41:17,028 --> 01:41:18,905
You fall, I catch you.

1195
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,284
<i>Excessive force confirmed.</i>

1196
01:42:07,245 --> 01:42:08,663
<i>Stop them.
Stop them now.</i>

1197
01:42:23,094 --> 01:42:26,806
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I made myself clear.

1198
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:31,269
– Do what you want. I'm leaving!
– Fine, Frobisher...

1199
01:42:31,394 --> 01:42:33,939
Go, but I take this.

1200
01:42:34,773 --> 01:42:36,233
– Give that to me.
– It's mine!

1201
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,317
I'm warning you!

1202
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:39,611
Under the conditions of this relationship,

1203
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:42,239
I'm certain that I'm in my legal rights.

1204
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,202
Give it to me. Give it to me, or I swear
to God I will kill you as you stand!

1205
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:52,123
Please... you're a coward.

1206
01:42:52,165 --> 01:42:55,252
– I'll do it.
– You won't pull that trigger.

1207
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,798
Your kind never does.

1208
01:43:19,734 --> 01:43:24,155
PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWING

1209
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:44,009
Yes. Yes, well...

1210
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:47,554
How-how fares our worm today, Adam?

1211
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,266
I- I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.

1212
01:43:51,349 --> 01:43:53,977
Oh no no no. Nonsense.
Nonsense.

1213
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:57,814
You mustn't give up.
You must think of your beautiful wife.

1214
01:43:58,064 --> 01:44:00,734
You must think of Tilda.

1215
01:44:21,546 --> 01:44:23,548
They're trapped in the downway.
We've got them.

1216
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:37,270
What are you doing?

1217
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:39,082
<i>Nay, the dead never stay dead.</i>

1218
01:45:43,169 --> 01:45:47,757
<i>Open your ears, and
they'll never stop a yibberin'.</i>

1219
01:46:02,355 --> 01:46:04,357
What is this place?

1220
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,819
Before the Fall,

1221
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:11,072
Old Uns built dwellings,

1222
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:14,743
beyond the sky, among the stars,

1223
01:46:16,077 --> 01:46:20,290
this place joined here with there.

1224
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:31,399
Sonmi.

1225
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:38,934
It is she.

1226
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:42,771
The Old Uns pray to Sonmi
same as Valleysmen?

1227
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:48,026
Nay... not 'zactly same.

1228
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:15,554
Stay close.
Fabricants get snatched here.

1229
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:19,891
– All clear.
– Thank you.

1230
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:23,395
No sweat, we're partners.
But you got to tell me what's happening.

1231
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,647
Okay, let me take off these clothes,
call the cops,

1232
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:28,274
and I promise I tell you everything
that happen in the morning.

1233
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,777
Okay. But I hope you
realize you just said exactly

1234
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,988
what every character in
any decent mystery says

1235
01:47:33,154 --> 01:47:34,823
right before they get killed.

1236
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,575
Good night, Javier.

1237
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:22,077
What'd you mean down there?
'bout...

1238
01:48:22,078 --> 01:48:27,417
The Old Uns and Valleymen prayin'
to Sonmi not 'zactly the same?

1239
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:32,380
Old men... they were different.

1240
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:35,967
Different?

1241
01:48:36,092 --> 01:48:37,510
How?

1242
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:42,474
You want the True-true?

1243
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,155
This is where you live?

1244
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,242
This... is where Union was born.

1245
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,669
Sonmi were no God.

1246
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:16,424
She died hundreds of years ago
on a faraway peninsula, deadlanded now.

1247
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,051
What?

1248
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:20,303
I cog Valleysmens beliefs,

1249
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,806
I know Abbess teach you
Sonmi was a miracle,

1250
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:27,269
birthed o' Darwin god o' Smart,
but ain't the True-true.

1251
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:33,108
Her life was sad n' judased, she died
tryin' to change the Old-Uns thinkin'.

1252
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:38,780
<i>Liiiies... nothing but lying.</i>

1253
01:49:38,863 --> 01:49:41,283
Nay, nay you-you're lying.

1254
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:55,833
The nature of our immortal
lives is in the...

1255
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:57,465
Sonmi?

1256
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:01,386
Before she died, she spoke
of her acts n' deedins'.

1257
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:05,223
Her words are heart savin' blessin',
remindin' me what's the True-true.

1258
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:09,144
How long you lissin' to this?!
How long you jus' stand there,

1259
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:14,941
n' let a stranger keep fuggin'
your beliefs up n' down, in n' out!

1260
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,361
<i>Our lives are not our own,</i>

1261
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:22,532
<i>from womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.</i>

1262
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:25,264
Zachry.

1263
01:50:26,578 --> 01:50:27,996
You alright?

1264
01:50:29,247 --> 01:50:30,582
Finish your saysoe...

1265
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,259
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

1266
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:45,680
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk.

1267
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:48,391
Be cool.
Alright.

1268
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:54,648
And if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

1269
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:58,777
How's it feel, uh?
Good conversation start, isn't it?

1270
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:04,574
You are Lester Rey's daughter,
that's for goddamn sure.

1271
01:51:05,116 --> 01:51:08,328
– You knew my father?
– Korean War.

1272
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,956
I was in the two-one.

1273
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:15,418
That's me on the end, next to your dad.

1274
01:51:15,794 --> 01:51:18,588
Mortar landed so close
it could have dropped out of my ass.

1275
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:22,676
If your father hadn't done what he did,
I wouldn't be here.

1276
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:29,766
Guess that makes two of us.

1277
01:51:39,568 --> 01:51:47,242
You ain't let go that rope cause you' a
lustin' for that darkly, sweet'meat.

1278
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,286
I cog it all, now.

1279
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:55,417
This whore, with her cokeynut
skin, and her slywise mask,

1280
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:59,504
smilin' n' wormin' her way into
your trust so you brin' her here,

1281
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:03,550
scavin' n' sivvin' for what?

1282
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:06,094
For what, fool?

1283
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:11,308
They want the island.
The Prescients want it all.

1284
01:52:11,349 --> 01:52:16,980
You judasin' your kin for a piece of ass.

1285
01:52:17,272 --> 01:52:19,733
She ain't your tribe, she
ain't even your color,

1286
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:22,694
she just 'bout ignorin'
all your yarns n' ways,

1287
01:52:22,903 --> 01:52:27,824
spinnin' n' spoutin' her whoahsomse lies,
and you lap it up, like a dog in heat!

1288
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:31,077
– That ain't truth.
– Ain't it? Then do sumthin', stop her!

1289
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,707
Take your spiker an' slit her throat!

1290
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:39,543
Protect your tribe,
protect your sister, little Caktin,

1291
01:52:39,544 --> 01:52:42,464
kill her now, before it's too late!

1292
01:52:47,052 --> 01:52:48,470
They will kill you.

1293
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:51,848
– You don't know these people like I do.
– Yeah?

1294
01:52:52,265 --> 01:52:54,893
Well if that's all you came to tell me,

1295
01:52:54,976 --> 01:52:56,603
you're a little bit late.

1296
01:52:56,686 --> 01:53:00,023
Somebody just forced me off
the Swannekke bridge.

1297
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:06,154
This is out of control.

1298
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,365
Do you know who did it?

1299
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:11,243
The contractor calls himself Bill Smoke.

1300
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,703
– And...
– What?

1301
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:16,957
He got Sachs.

1302
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:18,583
Isaac?

1303
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:20,168
A bomb on his plane.

1304
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:24,256
The press is blaming the PLO.

1305
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:31,012
He was a treat.
Like Sixsmith, like... you.

1306
01:53:39,187 --> 01:53:40,689
Bring them thru.

1307
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:55,412
Sonmi 451,
I'm most honored to meet you.

1308
01:53:55,704 --> 01:53:59,541
I am General An-Cor Apis,
leader of Union.

1309
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:02,752
Who is paying them?

1310
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:05,046
The same guy that pays me.

1311
01:54:05,755 --> 01:54:07,424
Lloyd Hooks?

1312
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:09,885
Hughes & Pikes Consulting.

1313
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:12,637
I've heard of them.

1314
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:16,182
They're, uh... lobbiers for oil companies.

1315
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:25,525
Why would big oil... hire
Lloyd Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?

1316
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:33,158
You get that same look your father
used to get. You see I told you.

1317
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:35,952
Hooks doesn't want the report discovered,

1318
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,288
because he doesn't want the reactor fixed.

1319
01:54:38,538 --> 01:54:40,415
He wants it to fail.

1320
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:43,168
This is about the future
of energy in this country.

1321
01:54:43,919 --> 01:54:47,839
They want the explosion.
The chaos and carnage.

1322
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,634
The more deaths, the better.

1323
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:05,607
Can't cog o' thing,
words n'worrins' like a wasp's nest,

1324
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,234
proke'd n'prod'd by you.

1325
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:11,238
You come elbowin' in' our life,
yibberin' about the True-true,

1326
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:13,281
and never tellin' the whole true.

1327
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:15,492
I need to cog what you doin'!

1328
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:19,371
I told you.
I come to send a plea o' help.

1329
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,372
Help, why?

1330
01:55:21,373 --> 01:55:23,917
To steal our land?
To kill n' slave us all?!

1331
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:25,377
What d'you want?!

1332
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:39,140
Prescients' dyin', Zach.
Just like Catkin.

1333
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:42,602
This world poison me n' all my kin'.

1334
01:55:43,144 --> 01:55:46,481
We get no help,
ain't no home if I don' find a way.

1335
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:50,151
I say the truesome.
We not survive.

1336
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,280
We not survive...

1337
01:55:56,992 --> 01:55:59,035
<i>Ayrs has the dogs after me.</i>

1338
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:03,081
<i>The bullet passed through,
killing little more than his appetite,</i>

1339
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:06,960
<i>and he's out for blood.
I'll have to pay the piper.</i>

1340
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:10,881
– I should call the cops.
– It won't help.

1341
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,259
How do I know you're not lying to me?

1342
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:17,971
Smoke will be coming for me,
as soon as he figures out I'm with you.

1343
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:20,390
We need that report.

1344
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,767
I can't protect you for long without it.

1345
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:27,439
– General Apis...
– You, my dear...

1346
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,817
are proof... our efforts were not in vain.

1347
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:33,820
But... I'm just a dinery server.

1348
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:37,115
I was not genomed to alter reality.

1349
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:39,576
No revolutionary ever was.

1350
01:56:44,289 --> 01:56:46,333
I'm sorry.

1351
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:49,127
I cannot do what you're asking.

1352
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:55,884
It would be a difficult choice for anyone.

1353
01:56:57,844 --> 01:57:01,681
But, before you call your decision final,

1354
01:57:01,723 --> 01:57:04,726
there is one last thing
I would like you to see,

1355
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:08,772
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for.

1356
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:31,753
Cross your fingers n' toes.

1357
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:22,721
If your pray' be answered,

1358
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:26,641
nay Prescients never
return to the Valley again?

1359
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:34,858
Those wishin' to come with us,
they're welcome.

1360
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:39,195
The Valley is my home.

1361
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:28,620
Are you alright?

1362
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:32,832
I know... it is forbidden.

1363
02:00:03,989 --> 02:00:08,952
<i>Sixsmith. I climb the steps of
the Scot monument every morning.</i>

1364
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,829
<i>And all becomes clear.</i>

1365
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:14,249
<i>Wish I could make you
see this brigthness.</i>

1366
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:18,545
<i>Don't worry, all is well.</i>

1367
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:22,090
<i>All is so perfectly, damnably well.</i>

1368
02:00:23,884 --> 02:00:30,765
<i>I understand now, that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions.</i>

1369
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:39,274
<i>All boundaries are conventions,
waiting to be transcended.</i>

1370
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:43,945
<i>One may trandcend any convention,</i>

1371
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:47,240
<i>if only one can first
conceive of doing so.</i>

1372
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:58,627
<i>Moments like this, I can feel your heart
beating as clearly as I feel my own,</i>

1373
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:02,839
<i>and I know that separation is an illusion.</i>

1374
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:13,600
<i>My life extends far beyond
the limitations of me.</i>

1375
02:01:31,535 --> 02:01:35,288
Storm is coming, Mr. Ewing.
Gonna get you down below.

1376
02:01:37,499 --> 02:01:41,878
I'm not running a fuckin' charity,
out with you! Off you go!!

1377
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:47,092
Aah, Mr. Ewing!
A-a-a word if you may.

1378
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:53,098
Dangerous times we have here.
About that scandal. They say that

1379
02:01:53,223 --> 02:01:57,310
ruffian Robert Frobisher is a composer.

1380
02:01:58,228 --> 02:02:02,607
You're a composer too,
aren't you Mr. Ewing?

1381
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:06,528
– What d'you want?
– The constable asked to search my rooms.

1382
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,738
I know how hard... you're working,

1383
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:12,033
so I told him there's
no one on the third floor.

1384
02:02:12,534 --> 02:02:17,539
It costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty.

1385
02:02:27,382 --> 02:02:29,301
– That's all I have.
– Hmm...

1386
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:37,559
What a beautiful... waistcoat.

1387
02:02:39,603 --> 02:02:41,521
If these letters are important,

1388
02:02:41,646 --> 02:02:44,065
– why d'you keep reading them?
– I don't know.

1389
02:02:44,816 --> 02:02:48,320
Maybe I'm... just trying
to understand something.

1390
02:02:49,738 --> 02:02:50,697
What?

1391
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:57,329
Why we keep making the
same mistakes, over and over.

1392
02:02:57,996 --> 02:03:01,166
Maybe you should ask... Megan.

1393
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:04,419
– What?
– Do you know a Megan?

1394
02:03:04,544 --> 02:03:07,422
That's his niece.
How do you know that?

1395
02:03:09,633 --> 02:03:11,468
Looks like he mailed something to her.

1396
02:03:11,927 --> 02:03:15,555
Probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in.

1397
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:20,352
Come on, Luisa.
First rule of mystery writing:

1398
02:03:20,435 --> 02:03:23,188
a good clue always leads to another clue.

1399
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:28,693
When the ghostly ordeal of Timothy
Cavendish is turned into a film,

1400
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:33,949
I'm thinking for the role of the hero,
one patch of Laurence Olivier

1401
02:03:34,074 --> 02:03:35,867
with a dash of Michael Caine.

1402
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,119
Who the hell is this?

1403
02:03:38,245 --> 02:03:41,080
<i>The Doctor Conway of Aurora House,
I'm covering for Dr. Upward.</i>

1404
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:44,250
– Ooh, is this about mother?
– Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss,

1405
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:45,835
I-I'm afraid you must deal yourself,

1406
02:03:45,877 --> 02:03:47,879
I don't think that she's
gonna last the night.

1407
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,799
<i>Unfortunately, it is an
unconvenient time for us,</i>

1408
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,009
do we really need to come right now?

1409
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:57,138
No no, of course not, but she
did ask for you specifically,

1410
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:00,225
and she seems quite upset
about her last will.

1411
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,188
I'll be right there.

1412
02:04:15,782 --> 02:04:18,952
<i>The plan was a series of topling dominoes,</i>

1413
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:22,914
<i>that had commenced with Ernie
announcing my death to nurse Noakes.</i>

1414
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:25,627
– I know, I know.
– Shhh!

1415
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:30,839
<i>The entire ambush hinged upon
the silence of Mr. Meeks.</i>

1416
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:33,010
– I know, I know.
– Shh!

1417
02:04:37,971 --> 02:04:39,848
Mr. Cavendish?

1418
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:42,517
Everything alright?

1419
02:04:46,104 --> 02:04:48,106
– Don't leave me here.
– Shh.

1420
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:04,831
Mr. Cavendish?

1421
02:05:10,295 --> 02:05:13,381
– I knew it was too good to be true!
– You temp-temperous witch!

1422
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:18,303
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother is my
dearest friend here. Do please hurry.

1423
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,684
And so... adieu!

1424
02:05:24,809 --> 02:05:30,148
Which, translated literally from the
French, means: "To command before...

1425
02:05:30,273 --> 02:05:31,441
God"!

1426
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:41,993
<i>I have Joe Napier on Line 1,
Mr. Hooks. He said it can't wait.</i>

1427
02:05:43,995 --> 02:05:46,540
For God sake, Joe,
I am late already. What's up?

1428
02:05:46,665 --> 02:05:51,002
<i>I got a call from that reporter. Rey...</i>

1429
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,421
She was asking about Sixsmith.

1430
02:05:53,505 --> 02:05:54,422
<i>I see.</i>

1431
02:05:54,548 --> 02:05:56,466
You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.

1432
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:01,930
Well, some problems are
more resilient than others, Joe.

1433
02:06:04,432 --> 02:06:07,686
– Where's the ruddy key?
– He didn't leave it in the ignition!

1434
02:06:07,811 --> 02:06:09,770
His wife was driving, she took it,

1435
02:06:09,771 --> 02:06:12,357
the ruddy female took
the key in with her!

1436
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:15,235
Oh Sweet Saint Ruddy Jude,
what do we do now?

1437
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,112
Look under the sunpad.

1438
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:23,076
What is it?

1439
02:06:23,201 --> 02:06:24,784
It's not a key, what'd you do with it?

1440
02:06:24,785 --> 02:06:26,913
– What else could it be?
– Well, how does it work?

1441
02:06:29,666 --> 02:06:31,167
– Shite!
– Oh no!

1442
02:06:31,459 --> 02:06:33,336
Well, think of something,
you're the genius,

1443
02:06:33,337 --> 02:06:35,547
you're the bloody ruddy genius!

1444
02:06:37,716 --> 02:06:39,009
We're done for.

1445
02:06:47,267 --> 02:06:51,354
Oh right... I can't even believe
I'm going to do this.

1446
02:06:52,355 --> 02:06:55,025
<i>Is this thing working?
I mean is it still on, can you hear me?</i>

1447
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:56,693
Just keep walking.

1448
02:07:04,034 --> 02:07:05,452
I think he's behind me.

1449
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:08,580
Whatever you do, don't look back.

1450
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:13,877
Get out of my car!

1451
02:07:22,302 --> 02:07:24,137
Press that button thru!

1452
02:07:37,108 --> 02:07:40,487
Oh no, it's Mr. Meeks,
he doesn't want to come.

1453
02:07:44,115 --> 02:07:46,284
Ruddy bloody hell!

1454
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:50,497
All for one and one for all?

1455
02:08:05,804 --> 02:08:07,180
The gate!

1456
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:11,810
Veronica, would you unlock
the door for Mr. Meeks.

1457
02:08:13,562 --> 02:08:17,023
Hello Mr. Meeks,
we're off for a lifetime trife.

1458
02:08:17,148 --> 02:08:19,150
I know, I know.

1459
02:08:24,072 --> 02:08:27,701
– Rev in speed!
– Ho, how fondling!

1460
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:31,319
Oh, no!

1461
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,373
Go for it, cavendish!
– Here we go!

1462
02:08:49,264 --> 02:08:50,932
Here we go.

1463
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:26,885
Come on, Adam, we haven't all day.
You really need to drink this.

1464
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:29,387
The worm fights back,

1465
02:09:29,429 --> 02:09:32,515
it is always darkest before the dawn.

1466
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:34,017
Mr. Ewing?

1467
02:09:34,935 --> 02:09:38,187
Mr. Ewing is at a critical
juncture in his treatment.

1468
02:09:38,188 --> 02:09:41,483
The next few hours will
determine if he lives or die.

1469
02:09:41,608 --> 02:09:43,276
Then I stay here.

1470
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:47,697
– No, no, no you can't.
– I must. Mr. Ewing saved my life.

1471
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:49,407
It my duty.

1472
02:09:51,993 --> 02:09:55,038
Listen to me, you ignorant ape,

1473
02:09:55,163 --> 02:09:56,915
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him,

1474
02:09:56,957 --> 02:09:58,792
you probably infected him to begin with.

1475
02:09:59,251 --> 02:10:03,129
He begged me, and I quote:
"Keep that dirty nigger away from me!"

1476
02:10:03,255 --> 02:10:06,299
So please kindly respect his wishes!

1477
02:10:37,706 --> 02:10:39,374
– Where'd he go?
– I don't know.

1478
02:10:43,795 --> 02:10:45,005
Shit!

1479
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:04,733
To freedom.

1480
02:11:29,549 --> 02:11:36,014
You are going to be sorry
in ways you cannot even imagine.

1481
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:27,107
– No immigrants here, no immigrants here.
– Look,

1482
02:12:27,148 --> 02:12:29,776
I'm not an inspector.
We need your help...

1483
02:12:32,195 --> 02:12:33,278
I don't understand.

1484
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:35,071
[IN PERFECT SPANISH]
We don't want the police to get involved,

1485
02:12:35,072 --> 02:12:36,908
but there is a man trying to kill me

1486
02:12:36,909 --> 02:12:39,327
and we really need your help.

1487
02:12:44,624 --> 02:12:48,712
Are there no true Scotsmen in the house?

1488
02:12:50,046 --> 02:12:54,092
Those there English gerrrrunts

1489
02:12:54,134 --> 02:12:58,722
are trampling all over
my God-given rrights!

1490
02:12:59,598 --> 02:13:02,058
These people are mine.

1491
02:13:06,187 --> 02:13:11,318
They've used me an' my pals most direly,

1492
02:13:11,443 --> 02:13:15,739
and we're in need
of a wee pit of assistance!

1493
02:13:15,864 --> 02:13:17,407
Right, pal...

1494
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:21,828
We'll not gonna let ye down.

1495
02:13:21,953 --> 02:13:24,080
Now you just look here, you grebo,

1496
02:13:24,122 --> 02:13:26,833
you can go shag your bloody sporran...

1497
02:14:01,368 --> 02:14:03,745
They two people came in here,
which way did they go?

1498
02:14:07,374 --> 02:14:09,501
Which way they go?!

1499
02:14:11,878 --> 02:14:13,046
Shut up!

1500
02:14:14,339 --> 02:14:15,966
Shut the fuck up!

1501
02:14:21,221 --> 02:14:23,014
Stupid fucking wetback.

1502
02:14:27,852 --> 02:14:29,479
What-what's that, Ewing?

1503
02:14:29,521 --> 02:14:34,276
How shall I comprehend
when you drool and dribble so?

1504
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:36,903
Oh, let me hazard a guess,
something in the key of

1505
02:14:36,945 --> 02:14:39,864
"Oh Henry, how could you do this to me?

1506
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:44,202
I thought we were friends?"
Oh, unfortunately, you're wrong.

1507
02:14:44,411 --> 02:14:48,623
Wrong like Horrox and
your silly father-in-law.

1508
02:14:48,748 --> 02:14:54,003
There is only one rule that binds
all people, one governing principle

1509
02:14:54,004 --> 02:14:56,673
that defines every relationship
on God's green earth.

1510
02:14:57,382 --> 02:15:02,012
"The Weak are Meat
and the Strong Do Eat."

1511
02:15:36,129 --> 02:15:37,130
That way.

1512
02:15:42,594 --> 02:15:46,014
I told Hooks you couldn't be trusted, Joe.

1513
02:15:46,056 --> 02:15:48,391
You'll be next, you silver bitch.

1514
02:15:48,516 --> 02:15:50,435
Part of the business.

1515
02:15:51,269 --> 02:15:53,521
Enjoy your retirement.

1516
02:15:59,152 --> 02:16:02,697
Amaba... a este... perro!

1517
02:16:06,493 --> 02:16:09,079
And don't call me a fucking wetback.

1518
02:16:13,667 --> 02:16:15,669
"Why?" you ask.

1519
02:16:15,752 --> 02:16:21,258
It's absurdly simple,
there is gold in your trunk, I want it.

1520
02:16:21,424 --> 02:16:23,843
so I've killed you for it.

1521
02:16:32,978 --> 02:16:35,355
Get off Mr. Ewing or you know I kill you!

1522
02:16:38,942 --> 02:16:41,027
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!

1523
02:16:41,152 --> 02:16:44,322
Gotta flush you out.
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.

1524
02:17:45,091 --> 02:17:46,800
What was that?

1525
02:17:46,801 --> 02:17:49,137
Kona war-cry.

1526
02:17:49,554 --> 02:17:50,722
Zachry!

1527
02:17:56,269 --> 02:17:57,687
Oh no no, Sonmi, no.

1528
02:17:58,521 --> 02:17:59,689
Zachry!

1529
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:09,741
This is what the general wanted me to see?

1530
02:18:20,877 --> 02:18:25,590
<i>The end rushes towards me.
Unable to eat or sleep.</i>

1531
02:18:25,715 --> 02:18:30,095
<i>Like Ewing, the "mortal coil"
has become a noose.</i>

1532
02:18:33,932 --> 02:18:36,434
<i>I'd rather become music.</i>

1533
02:18:45,819 --> 02:18:49,239
They believe they're going to Exultation.

1534
02:18:49,656 --> 02:18:52,534
But they are not, are they?

1535
02:19:06,047 --> 02:19:08,466
Welcome to Exultation.

1536
02:19:09,676 --> 02:19:11,136
Take a seat.

1537
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:16,850
Just relax.

1538
02:19:17,893 --> 02:19:20,687
This is to remove your collar.

1539
02:21:38,992 --> 02:21:42,996
<i>"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"</i>

1540
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:32,504
The genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks.

1541
02:22:32,629 --> 02:22:35,924
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force.

1542
02:22:37,092 --> 02:22:40,554
Recycled Fabricants are
a cheap source of protein.

1543
02:22:41,805 --> 02:22:43,390
Soap.

1544
02:22:45,892 --> 02:22:49,145
They feed us to ourselves.

1545
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:01,658
That ship...

1546
02:23:04,744 --> 02:23:07,455
The ship must be destroyed.

1547
02:23:09,457 --> 02:23:10,667
Yes.

1548
02:23:10,792 --> 02:23:15,338
The systems that built them
must be turned down.

1549
02:23:16,798 --> 02:23:17,841
Yes.

1550
02:23:19,092 --> 02:23:25,390
No matter if we're born in a tank
or a womb, we are all Pureblood.

1551
02:23:27,893 --> 02:23:28,685
Yes.

1552
02:23:31,271 --> 02:23:36,818
We must all fight...
and if necessary, die

1553
02:23:37,694 --> 02:23:41,823
to teach people the truth.

1554
02:23:49,956 --> 02:23:52,500
This is what we have been waiting for.

1555
02:23:59,299 --> 02:24:00,800
<i>It's done.</i>

1556
02:25:21,923 --> 02:25:25,886
You were then taken to
a Union control satellite link.

1557
02:25:26,761 --> 02:25:32,976
I broadcast my Revelation to the
twelve States and four Off-World colonies.

1558
02:25:33,643 --> 02:25:38,356
18 minutes later,
the Enforcers attacked.

1559
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:42,611
<i>To be is to be perceived.</i>

1560
02:25:43,236 --> 02:25:48,700
And so to know thyself is only possible
through the eyes of the other.

1561
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:54,038
<i>The nature of our immortal lives</i>

1562
02:25:54,039 --> 02:25:58,001
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds,

1563
02:25:58,919 --> 02:26:03,340
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time.

1564
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,717
Hide.

1565
02:27:14,744 --> 02:27:18,081
From good chief, now you're meat.

1566
02:28:20,393 --> 02:28:23,271
– Catkin...
– Uncle Zach.

1567
02:28:30,403 --> 02:28:31,738
Thanks, Zachry.

1568
02:28:32,447 --> 02:28:34,991
No, thank you.

1569
02:28:44,376 --> 02:28:48,171
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.
One more.

1570
02:28:48,672 --> 02:28:52,842
One more.
Salt clean out your stomach.

1571
02:28:56,137 --> 02:28:59,891
Close.
Com'on Mr. Ewing, com'on!

1572
02:29:03,853 --> 02:29:08,191
Do you see where we are, Mr. Ewing?

1573
02:29:10,151 --> 02:29:11,152
Home.

1574
02:29:18,201 --> 02:29:20,203
Megan Sixsmith?

1575
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:32,090
Make them pay.

1576
02:29:36,636 --> 02:29:38,680
You can count on it.

1577
02:29:48,064 --> 02:29:49,190
Thank you.

1578
02:29:53,194 --> 02:29:55,280
My uncle was a scientist,

1579
02:29:55,405 --> 02:29:58,950
but... he believed that love was real.

1580
02:30:00,202 --> 02:30:04,122
A kind of... natural phenomenon.

1581
02:30:06,666 --> 02:30:11,630
He believed that love could outlive death.

1582
02:30:15,050 --> 02:30:19,012
<i>I finished it in a frenzy that reminded me
of our last night in Cambridge.</i>

1583
02:30:20,388 --> 02:30:24,643
<i>Watched my final sunrise,
enjoyed the last cigarette.</i>

1584
02:30:25,143 --> 02:30:27,645
<i>Didn't think the view
could be anymore perfect,</i>

1585
02:30:27,646 --> 02:30:30,023
until I saw that beat-up trilby.

1586
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:35,987
<i>Honestly, Sixsmith, as
ridiculous as that thing makes you look,</i>

1587
02:30:36,112 --> 02:30:39,366
<i>I don't believe I've ever seen
anything more beautiful.</i>

1588
02:30:45,747 --> 02:30:48,291
<i>Watched you for as long as I dared.</i>

1589
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:55,131
<i>I don't believe it was a fluke
that I saw you first.</i>

1590
02:30:58,243 --> 02:30:59,495
– Okay.
– Thank you.

1591
02:31:04,891 --> 02:31:07,269
Captain saysoed he take you with us.

1592
02:31:07,394 --> 02:31:10,730
– I wanna go with Meronym.
– Go... Go where?

1593
02:31:11,731 --> 02:31:16,236
Prescients in the same boat as all us.
Got no home neitherwise.

1594
02:31:18,113 --> 02:31:21,283
Nay, not yet.

1595
02:31:23,076 --> 02:31:28,582
You think someone will gonna hear
your prayer, come down from the sky?

1596
02:31:28,957 --> 02:31:30,500
Perhaps...

1597
02:31:30,625 --> 02:31:32,586
Perhaps one day.

1598
02:31:32,711 --> 02:31:35,088
One day ain't but a flea o' hope.

1599
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:38,008
Yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.

1600
02:31:52,063 --> 02:31:55,442
<i>I believe there is another
world waiting for us, Sixsmith.</i>

1601
02:31:55,567 --> 02:31:57,485
<i>A better world.</i>

1602
02:31:57,986 --> 02:32:00,196
<i>And I'll be waiting for you there.</i>

1603
02:32:02,657 --> 02:32:03,867
May I help you, sir?

1604
02:32:03,868 --> 02:32:07,120
Yes, thank you. I-I'm looking for
a friend who came to Edinburg...

1605
02:32:14,127 --> 02:32:16,713
<i>I believe we do not stay dead long.</i>

1606
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:22,135
<i>Find me beneath the Corsican
stars where we first kissed.</i>

1607
02:32:23,595 --> 02:32:27,390
<i>Yours eternally.
R.F.</i>

1608
02:33:36,793 --> 02:33:40,922
The report said commander Zheng
was killed in the assault.

1609
02:33:41,631 --> 02:33:43,216
That is correct.

1610
02:33:44,801 --> 02:33:46,845
But you say that you loved him?

1611
02:33:48,555 --> 02:33:50,140
Yes I do.

1612
02:33:51,433 --> 02:33:54,728
You mean you are still in love with him?

1613
02:33:55,312 --> 02:33:57,981
I mean that I will always be.

1614
02:34:01,192 --> 02:34:04,487
Our lives are not our own.

1615
02:34:05,655 --> 02:34:10,493
From womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.

1616
02:34:13,413 --> 02:34:16,041
Past and present.

1617
02:34:23,924 --> 02:34:27,677
And by each crime and every kindness,

1618
02:34:29,304 --> 02:34:32,224
we birth our future.

1619
02:34:56,206 --> 02:35:00,042
In your Revelation, you spoke of
the consequences of an undividual's life

1620
02:35:00,043 --> 02:35:03,421
replicated throughout eternity.

1621
02:35:06,091 --> 02:35:09,177
Does this mean that
you believe in an afterlife?

1622
02:35:10,303 --> 02:35:12,389
No heaven or hell?

1623
02:35:15,225 --> 02:35:19,354
I believe death is only a door.

1624
02:35:21,189 --> 02:35:25,235
When its closes, another opens.

1625
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:29,489
If I'd care to imagine heaven,

1626
02:35:30,115 --> 02:35:32,742
I would imagine a door open.

1627
02:35:34,411 --> 02:35:36,538
And behind it,

1628
02:35:37,789 --> 02:35:41,918
I will find him there, waiting for me.

1629
02:35:52,679 --> 02:35:54,139
My love.

1630
02:35:58,643 --> 02:36:01,313
Oh God, I missed you so much.

1631
02:36:08,111 --> 02:36:09,529
Thank you, sir.

1632
02:36:11,656 --> 02:36:14,492
If I may ask one last question...

1633
02:36:14,951 --> 02:36:18,455
You had to know this Union
scheme was doomed to fail.

1634
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:19,581
Yes.

1635
02:36:19,873 --> 02:36:22,250
And why did you agree to it?

1636
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:26,463
This is what general Apis asked of me.

1637
02:36:26,588 --> 02:36:28,673
What, to be executed?

1638
02:36:29,090 --> 02:36:33,802
If I had remained invisible,
the truth would stay hidden.

1639
02:36:33,803 --> 02:36:35,847
I couldn't allow that.

1640
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:42,187
And what if no one believes this truth?

1641
02:36:44,814 --> 02:36:46,816
Someone already does.

1642
02:37:06,545 --> 02:37:08,296
Adam, good God...

1643
02:37:08,421 --> 02:37:12,050
I have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure.

1644
02:37:12,175 --> 02:37:14,760
Please, join us.
Give him a chair.

1645
02:37:14,761 --> 02:37:16,263
No no, thank you.

1646
02:37:16,388 --> 02:37:18,390
I cannot stay.

1647
02:37:18,473 --> 02:37:22,102
What are you doing here? Has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed?

1648
02:37:22,269 --> 02:37:24,938
He did, but this couldn't wait.

1649
02:37:26,106 --> 02:37:28,107
I need to speak with you, sir.
Privately.

1650
02:37:28,108 --> 02:37:30,151
Of course.

1651
02:37:38,702 --> 02:37:41,746
Is that the contract
from Reverend Horrox?

1652
02:37:42,956 --> 02:37:46,459
– It is indeed.
– Well, you know I could have sent a boy.

1653
02:37:51,923 --> 02:37:54,092
Are you insane?!

1654
02:37:54,467 --> 02:37:58,513
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.

1655
02:37:59,472 --> 02:38:03,977
And I cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer.

1656
02:38:06,688 --> 02:38:08,857
This would make such a good book.

1657
02:38:08,982 --> 02:38:10,609
I'll drink to that.

1658
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:26,917
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls.</i>

1659
02:38:27,042 --> 02:38:32,631
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

1660
02:38:32,714 --> 02:38:36,968
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

1661
02:38:48,772 --> 02:38:54,069
Goddamn you, sir, if you were
not my daughter's husband...

1662
02:38:54,194 --> 02:38:55,737
Hello, Father.

1663
02:38:56,404 --> 02:38:57,572
Tilda?

1664
02:39:00,408 --> 02:39:01,784
What's going on?

1665
02:39:01,785 --> 02:39:04,246
I've come to say goodbye.

1666
02:39:04,371 --> 02:39:06,873
Goodbye?
Where are you going?

1667
02:39:06,998 --> 02:39:10,710
We're moving back East,
to work with the abolitionists.

1668
02:39:10,835 --> 02:39:12,337
What?

1669
02:39:13,296 --> 02:39:17,634
That poison has rotted your brain.

1670
02:39:17,676 --> 02:39:20,303
Oh if it has, I highly recommend it.

1671
02:39:20,512 --> 02:39:22,639
I've not felt this good in years.

1672
02:39:22,764 --> 02:39:26,851
Tilda, I forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man.

1673
02:39:26,977 --> 02:39:30,105
I've been afraid of you
my whole life, Father.

1674
02:39:32,941 --> 02:39:35,277
I'm going with my husband.

1675
02:39:40,323 --> 02:39:41,241
Adam.

1676
02:39:45,287 --> 02:39:47,080
Listen to me...

1677
02:39:47,581 --> 02:39:51,293
For the sake of my grandson,
if not your own...

1678
02:39:51,418 --> 02:39:54,545
there is a natural order to this world,

1679
02:39:54,546 --> 02:39:58,258
and those who try to upend it
do not fare well.

1680
02:39:59,885 --> 02:40:02,804
This movement will never survive.

1681
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:07,976
If you join them, you and
your entire family will be shunned.

1682
02:40:08,101 --> 02:40:12,689
At best, you exist as pariah,
to be spat on and beaten.

1683
02:40:13,231 --> 02:40:16,776
At worst, lynched or crucified.

1684
02:40:34,419 --> 02:40:36,338
And for what?

1685
02:40:37,881 --> 02:40:39,341
For what?

1686
02:40:39,466 --> 02:40:42,676
No matter what you do, it will
never amount to anything more

1687
02:40:42,677 --> 02:40:46,389
than a single drop in a limitless ocean.

1688
02:40:47,557 --> 02:40:51,061
What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

1689
02:41:04,491 --> 02:41:06,409
Fire is dyin'.

1690
02:41:07,786 --> 02:41:10,914
Just as well, my yawnin' is done.

1691
02:41:10,939 --> 02:41:12,939
No, please Gran'Pi, Please!

1692
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:18,421
Come on, come here, you little buggars!
Com'on, it's getting cold!

1693
02:41:18,505 --> 02:41:21,717
No, you heard your Gran'mi,
com'on, get on with you.

1694
02:41:33,436 --> 02:41:36,398
You like it down here, don't you Gran'pi?

1695
02:41:37,065 --> 02:41:41,027
Supposin'... reminds me of my Valley.

1696
02:41:41,152 --> 02:41:42,904
Which is Earth?

1697
02:41:45,991 --> 02:41:49,035
That in there, that blue shimmerin'.

1698
02:41:54,291 --> 02:41:56,543
Now, help your Gran'pi up.

1699
02:42:00,672 --> 02:42:04,430
You gonna tell us about the
roguesome ship, and the big split,

1700
02:42:04,431 --> 02:42:05,719
and all the next-next?

1701
02:42:05,844 --> 02:42:09,431
Oh, your Gran'mi tells the next-next
way better than me.

1702
02:42:11,349 --> 02:42:13,643
D'you still love Gran'mi?

1703
02:42:15,896 --> 02:42:20,650
Your Gran'mi is the best thin'
that ever happened to me.

1704
02:42:26,823 --> 02:42:28,992
Come on, you Gran'pi.

1705
02:42:29,117 --> 02:42:32,037
Let me warm that li'le ol' bone.

1706
02:42:50,549 --> 02:42:58,549
