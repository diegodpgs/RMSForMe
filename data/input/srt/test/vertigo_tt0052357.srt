1
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,689
Give me your hand!

2
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,737
Give me your hand.

3
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,810
I thought you said
no more aches or pains.

4
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,937
No, it's this
darned corset.
It binds.

5
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,649
No three-way stretch?
How very un-chic.

6
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,737
You know those
police department doctors.
No sense of style.

7
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,573
Well, anyway,
tomorrow will be the day.

8
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,950
Why, what's tomorrow?

9
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,078
Tomorrow? The corset
comes off tomorrow.

10
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,914
I'll be able to scratch myself
like anybody else tomorrow.

11
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,583
I'll throw this miserable
thing out the window.

12
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,086
Be a free...
I'll be a free man.

13
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,297
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

14
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,175
Mmm. More than you think.
Really?

15
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,845
What, do you know that
from personal experience or...

16
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,263
Please.

17
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,516
What happens after tomorrow?

18
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,684
What do you mean?

19
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,604
Well, what are you
going to do once you've
quit the police force?

20
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,774
You sound so
disapproving, Midge.

21
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,359
No, it's your life.

22
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,695
But you were the bright,
young lawyer that decided

23
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,531
he was going to be
chief of police someday.

24
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,283
I had to quit.

25
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,409
Why?

26
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,163
Well, it's because of
this fear of heights
I have, this acrophobia.

27
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,707
I wake up at night seeing
that man fall from the roof,

28
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,585
and I try to reach out
to him, and... It's just...

29
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,253
It wasn't your fault.

30
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,464
I know. That's what
everybody tells me.

31
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,340
Johnny, the doctors
explained to you...

32
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,551
I know, I know.

33
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,305
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo,
and I get dizzy.

34
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,933
Boy! What a moment
to find out I had it.

35
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,727
Well, you've got it,
and there's no losing it.

36
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,480
And there's no one to blame.
So why quit?

37
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,566
You mean,
and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

38
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,776
Where you belong.

39
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,236
What about my acrophobia?
What about...

40
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,907
Now suppose I'm sitting in
this chair, behind the desk.
Here's the desk.

41
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,992
And a pencil falls
from the desk
down to the floor,

42
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,411
and I reach down to pick up
the pencil. Bingo!
My acrophobia's back.

43
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,122
Oh, Johnny-O.

44
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,501
Well, what'll you do?

45
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,712
Well, I'm not gonna
do anything for a while.

46
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,966
You know, don't forget,
I'm a man of independent
means, as the saying goes.

47
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,093
Fairly independent.

48
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,260
Mmm-hmm.

49
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,846
Well, why don't you
go away for a while?

50
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,598
You mean, to forget?

51
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,142
Oh, no, Midge,
don't be so motherly.

52
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,895
I'm not gonna crack up.

53
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,231
Have you had any
dizzy spells this week?

54
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,942
I'm having one right now.

55
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,778
Midge, the music.
Don't you think
it's sort of...

56
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,696
Oh.

57
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,283
What's this doohickey?

58
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,332
It's a brassiere.
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.

59
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,960
I've never run across
one like that.

60
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,503
It's brand-new.

61
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,382
Revolutionary uplift.
No shoulder straps,
no back straps,

62
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,135
but does everything
a brassiere should do.

63
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,012
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

64
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,848
It does?
Mmm-hmm.

65
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,976
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula
designed it.

66
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,395
He worked it out
in his spare time.

67
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,272
Kind of a hobby.

68
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,317
A do-it-yourself
type of thing.

69
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,822
How's your love life, Midge?

70
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,949
That's following
a train of thought.

71
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,118
Well...

72
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,537
Normal.

73
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,206
Aren't you ever
gonna get married?

74
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,959
You know there's only
one man in the world
for me, Johnny-O.

75
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,588
You mean me.
We were engaged once,
though, weren't we?

76
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,757
Three whole weeks.

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,718
Good old college days.

78
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,889
But you were the one that
called off the engagement,
you remember?

79
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,309
I'm still available.
Available Ferguson.

80
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,605
Oh, Midge, do you remember
a fellow in college
by the name of Gavin Elster?

81
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,356
Gavin Elster?

82
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,025
Yes, funny name.

83
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,985
You think I would. No.

84
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,699
I got a call from Gavin today.
It's funny, he sort of dropped
out of sight during the war.

85
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,535
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

86
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,579
It's a Mission number.

87
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,539
Well, that's skid row,
isn't it?

88
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,957
Could be.

89
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,711
He's probably on the bum,
and wants to touch you
for the price of a drink.

90
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,007
Well, I'm on the bum.
I'll buy him a couple drinks
and tell him my troubles.

91
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,676
But not tonight.
How about you and me
going out for a beer?

92
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,137
Mmm-mmm.
Sorry, old man. Work.

93
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,555
Well, then,
I think I'll go home.

94
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,104
Midge, what'd you mean,
"There's no losing it"?

95
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,356
What?

96
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,067
The acrophobia.

97
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,028
I asked my doctor.

98
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,241
He said that only another
emotional shock could do it
and probably wouldn't.

99
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,118
You're not gonna go
diving off another
rooftop to find out?

100
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,579
I think I can lick it.
Well, how?

101
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,206
I have a theory.

102
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,294
I have a theory. I think
if I can get used to heights,
just a little bit at a time,

103
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,631
just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

104
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,591
I'll show you what I mean.

105
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,386
Here. I'll show you
what I mean.

106
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,515
We'll start with this.
That?

107
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,810
What do you want me to start
with, the Golden Gate Bridge?
Now, watch.

108
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,853
Watch this. Here we go.

109
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,357
There. There.

110
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,444
Now, I look up,
I look down.

111
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,530
I look up.

112
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,823
All right, there's
nothing to it.
You're kidding.

113
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,366
Wait a minute.
There's nothing to it.

114
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,119
Here.

115
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,914
That's a girl.
I'll use that.
Put it right there.

116
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,044
All right, here's
the first step.

117
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,130
There.

118
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,257
Okay, now step number two.

119
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,427
All right.
Step number two coming up.

120
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,973
There we are.

121
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,476
See? I look up,
I look down,
I look up...

122
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,479
I'm going right out
and buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

123
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,939
Take it easy now.

124
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,066
All right, now here we go.

125
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,526
No problem.

126
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,869
Why, this is a cinch.
Here, I look up,
I look down.

127
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,747
I look up, I look down.

128
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,467
Oh, Johnny, Johnny.

129
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,612
How did you get
in the shipbuilding
business, Gavin?

130
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,864
I married into it.

131
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,618
Very interesting business.

132
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,162
No, to be honest,
I find it dull.

133
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,373
Well, you don't have to
do it for a living.

134
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,958
No, but one assumes
responsibilities.

135
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,628
My wife's family
is all gone.

136
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,547
Someone has to look
after her interests.

137
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,635
Her father's partner
runs the company yard
in the East, Baltimore.

138
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,473
So I decided, as long
as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.

139
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,850
I've always
liked it here.

140
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,936
How long have you
been back?

141
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,562
Almost a year.

142
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,356
You like it, huh?

143
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,192
Well, San Francisco's
changed.

144
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,154
The things that spell
San Francisco to me
are disappearing fast.

145
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,951
Like all these.

146
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:29,331
Yes. I should have liked to have lived here then.
Color, excitement, power.

147
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,333
Freedom.

148
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,670
Shouldn't you
be sitting down?

149
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,380
No. No, I'm all right.

150
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,844
I was sorry to read about
that thing in the paper.
And you've quit the force.

151
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,596
Is it a permanent
physical disability?

152
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,098
No, no.

153
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,519
It just means that I can't
climb stairs that are too
steep or go to high places,

154
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,980
like the bar at
the Top of the Mark.

155
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,691
But, there are plenty
of street-level bars
in this town.

156
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,860
Would you like a drink now?

157
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,989
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a little early
in the day for me.

158
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,537
Well, I guess that just
about covers everything,
doesn't it?

159
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,124
I never married.
I don't see much of
the old college gang,

160
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,211
I'm a retired detective,
and you're in the
shipbuilding business.

161
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,965
What's on your mind, Gavin?

162
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,887
I asked you to come up here,
Scottie, knowing that
you'd quit detective work.

163
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,683
But I wondered whether
you'd go back on the job
as a special favor to me.

164
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,810
I want you
to follow my wife.

165
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,938
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

166
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,398
Well, then...

167
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,817
I'm afraid some harm
may come to her.

168
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,235
From whom?

169
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,361
Someone dead.

170
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,411
Scottie, do you
believe that someone
out of the past,

171
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:54,166
someone dead, can enter
and take possession
of a living being?

172
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,250
No.

173
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,756
If I told you that I believe
this has happened to my wife,
what would you say?

174
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,344
Well, I'd say take her to
the nearest psychiatrist,
or psychologist,

175
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,515
or neurologist, or psycho...
Or maybe just
the plain family doctor.

176
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,266
I'd have him
check on you, too.

177
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,021
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

178
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,608
Thanks for coming in,
Scottie.

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,817
Okay.

180
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,322
I... I didn't mean
to be that rough.

181
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,783
No, it sounds idiotic,
I know.

182
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,411
And you're still
the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

183
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,873
Always were.
Do you think
I'm making it up?

184
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,792
No.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,754
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

186
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,550
She'll be talking to me
about something.

187
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,219
Suddenly, the words
fade into silence.

188
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,056
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

189
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,436
She's somewhere else,
away from me,
someone I don't know.

190
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,940
I call to her,
she doesn't even hear me.

191
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,151
Then, with a long sigh,
she's back,

192
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,155
looks at me brightly,
doesn't even know
she's been away.

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,324
Can't tell me
where or when.

194
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,120
Well, how often
does this happen?

195
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,914
More and more
in the past few weeks.

196
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,501
And she wanders.
God knows
where she wanders.

197
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,588
I followed her one day,

198
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,508
watched her coming
out of the apartment,
someone I didn't know.

199
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,344
She even walked
a different way.

200
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:35,726
Got into her car and drove
out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

201
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,562
Sat by the lake,

202
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,815
staring across the water
at the pillars that stand
on the far shore.

203
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,151
You know, Portals of the Past.

204
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,362
Sat there a long time,
without moving.

205
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,532
I had to leave,
get back to the office.

206
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,910
When I got home that
evening, I asked her
what she'd done all day.

207
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,123
She said she'd driven out
to Golden Gate Park and
sat by the lake, that's all.

208
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,501
Well?

209
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,256
The speedometer on her car
showed that she'd driven
94 miles.

210
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,717
Where did she go?

211
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,138
I've gotta know, Scottie,
where she goes
and what she does

212
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,806
before I get involved
with doctors.

213
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,975
Well, have you talked
to the doctors at all,
about that?

214
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,852
Yes, but carefully.

215
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,105
I want to know more
before committing her
to that kind of care.

216
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,148
Scottie...

217
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,318
All right, I'll get you
a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

218
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,569
They're dependable,
good boys.

219
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,071
I want you.

220
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,740
Look, this isn't my line.

221
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,953
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.
I'm in a panic about this.

222
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm supposed to be retired.
I don't want to get mixed up
in this darn thing.

223
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,419
Look, we're going
to an opening
at the opera tonight.

224
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,881
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

225
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,593
Ernie's.

226
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,639
Say, will you tell me
something about
the lady sitting in there?

227
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,808
Who's the woman
in the painting
she's looking at?

228
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,310
Oh, that's Carlotta.

229
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,813
You'll find it
in the catalog.
Portrait of Carlotta.

230
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,981
May I have this?
Yes.

231
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,441
Thank you.

232
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,059
Yes?

233
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:37,024
Is there something
I can do for you?

234
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,610
Yes. You run this hotel?
Oh, yes.

235
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,824
Would you tell me who has
the room on the second floor
in the corner, that corner?

236
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,786
Oh, I'm afraid
we couldn't give out
information of that sort.

237
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,081
Our clients are
entitled to their privacy,
you know.

238
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,792
And I do believe
it's against the law.

239
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,714
Of course, I don't think
any of them would mind,
really, but still I...

240
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,593
Oh, dear, has she done
something wrong?

241
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,511
Please answer my question.

242
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,139
I can't imagine that
sweet girl with that
dear face...

243
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,265
What's her name?

244
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,351
Valdes. Miss Valdes.
Spanish, you know.

245
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,603
Carlotta Valdes?

246
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,229
Yeah, that's it.

247
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,857
Sweet name, isn't it?
Foreign, but sweet.

248
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,275
How long has she
had the room?

249
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,987
Oh, it must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

250
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,156
Does she sleep here, ever?

251
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,534
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

252
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,371
I don't ask questions,
you know, as long as
they're well-behaved.

253
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,998
But I must say...

254
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,334
When she comes down,
don't say that
I've been here.

255
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,836
Oh, but she hasn't
been here today.

256
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,255
I just saw her come in
five minutes ago.

257
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,841
No, she hasn't
been here at all.

258
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,301
Well, I would have
seen her, you know.

259
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:50,097
I've been right here all
the time, putting olive oil
on my rubber plant leaves.

260
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,270
And there. There, you see?
Her key is on the rack.

261
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,065
Well, would you
please go up and look?

262
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,399
To her room?
That's right.

263
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,568
Yes, of course,
if you ask.

264
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,280
But it does seem silly.
Thank you.

265
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,509
Oh, Mr. Detective?

266
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,764
Would you like
to come and look?

267
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,919
Her car's gone.

268
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,337
What car?

269
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:39,248
Midge, who do you know
that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

270
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,627
That's the kind of
greeting a girl likes.

271
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,462
None of this, "Hello,
you look wonderful," stuff.

272
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,340
Just a good straight,
"Who do you know that's an
authority on San Francisco..."

273
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,508
Want a drink?
No, thanks.

274
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,053
Well, who do you?
You know everybody.

275
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,431
Professor Saunders,
over in Berkeley.

276
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,433
No, no, I don't mean
that kind of history.

277
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,562
I mean the small stuff,
you know, people
you never heard of.

278
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,314
Oh.

279
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,568
Well, you mean
the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

280
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:12,490
Juicy stories, like who
shot who in the Embarcadero
in August, 1879.

281
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,658
Yeah, that's right.

282
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,326
Pop Leibel.
Who?

283
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,245
Pop Leibel. He owns
the Argosy Book Shop.

284
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,331
Why, what do you
want to know?

285
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,585
I want to know who shot
who in the Embarcadero
in August, 1879.

286
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,879
Hey, wait a minute.

287
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,215
You're not
a detective anymore.
What's going on?

288
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,633
You know him well?

289
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,676
Who?

290
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Pop Leibel.

291
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,178
Oh, sure.

292
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,890
Well, come on, let's go.
I want you to introduce me.
Get your hat.

293
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,684
I don't need a hat.

294
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,230
Hey, Johnny,
what's it all about?

295
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,858
Hey.

296
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,111
Wait a minute.

297
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:00,955
Hello. Yes,
I remember. Carlotta.

298
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,833
The beautiful Carlotta.

299
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,836
The sad Carlotta.

300
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,214
What does an old
wooden house at the corner
of Eddy and Gough Street

301
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,924
have to do with
Carlotta Valdes?

302
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,387
Well, it was hers.
It was built for her
many years ago.

303
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,472
By whom?
By...

304
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,308
By...

305
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,022
No. The name,
I do not remember.

306
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,984
A rich man,
a powerful man.

307
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,319
Cigarette?
No, thank you.

308
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,488
Cigarette, miss?
No, thanks.

309
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,867
It is not an unusual story.

310
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,788
She came from somewhere small
to the south of the city.

311
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,418
Some say from
a mission settlement.

312
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,296
Young, yes.
Very young.

313
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:57,011
And she was found
dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man.

314
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:03,184
And he took her
and built for her
the great house

315
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,227
in the Western Addition.

316
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:11,066
And there was a...
There was a child.

317
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,528
Yes, that's it.
A child. A child.

318
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,451
I cannot tell you
exactly how much
time passed,

319
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,870
or how much happiness
there was.

320
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,623
But, then,
he threw her away.

321
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,085
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

322
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,673
So he kept the child
and threw her away.

323
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,094
You know, a man could
do that in those days.

324
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,889
They had the power
and the freedom.

325
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,227
And she became
the sad Carlotta.

326
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:51,732
Alone in the great house,
walking the streets alone.

327
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,821
Her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

328
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,576
And the mad Carlotta.

329
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,163
Stopping people
in the streets to ask,

330
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,124
"Where is my child?

331
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,336
"Have you seen my child?"

332
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,172
Poor thing.

333
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,674
And she died.

334
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,509
She died.
How?

335
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,345
By her own hand.

336
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,934
There are many
such stories.

337
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,520
Well, thank you very much.
You are welcome.

338
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,188
I appreciate it.
Good-bye.

339
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,273
Good-bye.

340
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,693
Hey, wait a minute!
Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.

341
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,828
Now then, Johnny-O,
pay me.
For what?

342
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,330
For bringing you here.
Come on, tell.

343
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,915
There's nothing to tell.

344
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,376
You'll tell or you'll
be back in that corset.
Come on, Johnny, please.

345
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,961
Come on, come on.
I'll take you home.

346
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,181
There we are.

347
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,976
You haven't told me
everything.
No, I've told you enough.

348
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,686
Who's the guy
and who's the wife?

349
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,521
Out. I've got things to do.

350
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:16,400
I know. The one that phoned,
your old college chum, Elster.

351
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,569
Midge, out, please.
And the idea is

352
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,196
that the beautiful,
mad Carlotta has come
back from the dead

353
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,741
and taken possession
of Elster's wife.

354
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,744
Now, Johnny, really.
Come on.

355
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,788
Well, I'm not telling you
what I think. I'm telling
you what he thinks.

356
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,248
Well, what do you think?

357
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,791
Well, I...

358
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,169
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?

359
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,880
No, not Carlotta.
Elster's wife.

360
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,425
Yes.

361
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,094
I guess you'd consider
that she would be...

362
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,598
I think I'll go take
a look at that portrait.
Good-bye.

363
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,807
Midge...

364
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,851
Good-bye.
Midge, you...

365
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,384
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

366
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,344
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.

367
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,930
There are things
you didn't tell me.

368
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,641
I didn't know
where she'd lead you.
But you knew about this.

369
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,976
Oh, yeah.

370
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,813
You notice the way
she does her hair?

371
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,648
You know,
there's something else.

372
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:42,194
My wife, Madeleine,
has several pieces of jewelry
that belonged to Carlotta.

373
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,154
She inherited them.

374
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,865
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

375
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,283
Until now.

376
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,913
Now, when she's alone,
she takes them out
and looks at them,

377
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,541
handles them gently,
curiously.

378
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,170
Puts them on
and stares at herself
in the mirror.

379
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,757
And goes into
that other world,
is someone else again.

380
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,094
Now, Carlotta Valdes
was what?

381
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,388
Your wife's grandmother?

382
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,306
Great-grandmother.

383
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,517
Now, the child
who was taken from her,

384
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,188
whose loss drove Carlotta
mad and to her death,
was Madeleine's grandmother.

385
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,526
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdes home.

386
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,863
Well, I think
that explains it.

387
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:30,451
Anyone could become
obsessed with the past
with a background like that.

388
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,871
She never heard
of Carlotta Valdes.

389
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,207
She knows nothing of a grave
out at the Mission Dolores?

390
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,044
Or that old house
on Eddy Street? The...

391
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:44,381
The portrait at the
Palace of the Legion of...
Nothing.

392
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,383
Well, when she goes
to these places...

393
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,510
She's no longer my wife.

394
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,931
Well, how do you know
all these things
she doesn't?

395
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,226
Her mother told me
most of them
before she died.

396
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,395
I dug out the rest
for myself here.

397
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,522
Why wouldn't
she tell her daughter?

398
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,024
Natural fear.

399
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,527
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

400
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,155
Her blood is in Madeleine.

401
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,497
Boy, I need this.

402
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,872
Madeleine.

403
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,709
Madeleine!

404
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,938
Yes?

405
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,859
No, it's all right.

406
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,153
Yeah, I'll call you back.

407
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:02,366
Yes.

408
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,036
Are you all right?

409
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,414
Oh. Oh, your...

410
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,000
You'll want this.

411
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,456
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

412
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,879
What am I doing here?

413
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,674
What happened?

414
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,304
Well, you fell
into San Francisco Bay.

415
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,977
And I tried
to dry your hair
as best I could.

416
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,270
Your things are
in the kitchen.

417
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:16,106
They'll be dry
in a few minutes.

418
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,191
Come on over by the fire.

419
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,077
Here, I'll get you
some cushions.

420
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,540
There you are.

421
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,176
Would you like
to have some coffee?

422
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,140
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink.

423
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:57,063
I fell into the Bay
and you fished me out?

424
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,565
That's right.

425
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,609
Thank you.

426
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,361
You don't remember?

427
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,905
No, I...

428
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,909
You remember
where you were?

429
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,623
Why, yes. Yes, of course
I remember that.

430
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:20,712
But then I must have had
a dizzy spell and fainted.

431
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,339
Where were you?

432
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,885
At old Fort Point,
out at the Presidio.

433
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,097
Of course, I remember.
I often go there.

434
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,141
Why? Why do you go there?

435
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,229
Because I love it so.
It's beautiful there,

436
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,940
especially at sunset.

437
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,194
Thank you for the fire.

438
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,112
Where were you before?

439
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,782
When?
This afternoon, I mean.

440
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,327
Wandering about.

441
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,205
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

442
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,377
Downtown, shopping.

443
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,508
Here, you'd better
have some coffee.
I think it's still warm.

444
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,805
You're terribly direct
in your questions.

445
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,474
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

446
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:18,478
You're not.
You're merely direct.

447
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,318
And what were you doing there,
at old Fort Point?

448
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,280
Oh, just wandering about.

449
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:29,990
Oh, you like it too?

450
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,241
Yes.

451
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,578
And where had you been
just before?

452
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:38,707
I'd been to the
Palace of the Legion of Honor,
the art gallery.

453
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,918
Oh, yes, that's
a lovely spot, isn't it?

454
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:46,590
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely
driving past.

455
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,599
It's lucky for me
you were wandering about.

456
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,100
Thank you.

457
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,977
I've been a terrible
bother to you.

458
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,645
No, you haven't.

459
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,191
Oh, when you...

460
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,115
There were some pins
in my hair.

461
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,201
Oh, the pins, yes.
Right in here.
I'll get them for you.

462
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,037
And my purse, please.

463
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,627
Here you are.

464
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,003
Thank you.

465
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,133
You shouldn't have
brought me here,
you know.

466
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,719
Well, I didn't know
where you lived.

467
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,680
You could have
looked in my car.

468
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,807
Oh, but then, you didn't
know my car, did you?

469
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,435
No, I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

470
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,980
But I didn't think
you wanted to be
taken home that way.

471
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,273
No, you're right.

472
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm glad you didn't
take me home. I wouldn't
have known you.

473
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:53,823
Thank you.
But I don't know you,
and you don't know me.

474
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,492
My name is
Madeleine Elster.

475
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,160
My name's John Ferguson.

476
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:01,373
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call
you John or Jack?

477
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,667
Oh, John, mostly.

478
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,253
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

479
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,089
I shall call you
Mr. Ferguson.

480
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,384
Oh, gee whiz,
I wouldn't like that.
Oh, no.

481
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,888
And after what happened this
afternoon, I should think
maybe you'd call me Scottie.

482
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,598
Maybe even John.

483
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,684
I prefer John.

484
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,315
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

485
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,318
Wander about.

486
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:33,947
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

487
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,325
One shouldn't live alone.

488
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,285
Some people prefer it.

489
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,414
No, it's wrong.

490
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,585
I'm married, you know.

491
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,883
Will you tell me something?

492
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,553
Has this ever happened
to you before?

493
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:57,721
What?

494
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,724
Falling into
San Francisco Bay.

495
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:02,726
Oh.

496
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,062
No. No, it's never
happened before.

497
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,442
Oh, I've fallen into lakes
out of rowboats
when I was a little girl.

498
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:14,988
I even fell into the river
once, trying to leap
from one stone to another.

499
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,866
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

500
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,661
Have you ever before?

501
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,664
No, it's the first time
for me, too.

502
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,586
Here, I'll get you
some more coffee.

503
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,768
Hello?

504
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,770
Scottie, what happened?
She's not home yet.

505
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:50,482
No, she's all right.
She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

506
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,317
Oh, what happened?

507
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,277
She went into the Bay.

508
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,947
Hello? Hello?

509
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,157
Did she hurt herself?

510
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,868
No, she's going to be
in fine shape. There's
nothing to worry about.

511
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,621
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?

512
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,915
She doesn't know
what happened.

513
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,712
Scottie, Madeleine is 26.

514
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:16,466
Carlotta Valdes
committed suicide
when she was 26.

515
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,303
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

516
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,336
Well now, Johnny-O.
Was it a ghost?

517
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,588
Was it fun?

518
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,322
That letter for me?

519
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,371
Yes. Hello.

520
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,664
Hello.

521
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:39,085
I worried about you
last night. You shouldn't
have run off that way.

522
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,629
Well, I suddenly
felt such a fool.

523
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,840
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

524
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,884
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine.
No aftereffects.

525
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,888
But as I remember now,
the water was cold,
wasn't it?

526
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,515
It sure was.

527
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,642
What a terrible thing
for me to do.

528
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,310
You were so kind.

529
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,190
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

530
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,276
Oh, you've nothing
to apologize for.

531
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,694
Oh, yes, I do.

532
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,113
The whole thing
must have been
so embarrassing for you.

533
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,198
Not at all. I enjoyed

534
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,452
talking to you.

535
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,040
Well, I enjoyed
talking to you.

536
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,879
Well, I'll get my mail.

537
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,923
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

538
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,717
No. No, thank you.

539
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,223
Well, I couldn't mail it.
I didn't know your address,
but I had a landmark.

540
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,101
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

541
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:41,022
Well, that's the first time
I've been grateful
for Coit Tower.

542
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,527
I hope we will, too.

543
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:47,570
What?

544
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,197
Meet again sometime.

545
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,573
We have.

546
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,827
Good-bye.

547
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,762
Where are you going?

548
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,223
Oh, I don't know.
Shopping?

549
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,265
No.

550
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,559
Well, anywhere
in particular?

551
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,063
No, I just thought
that I'd wander.

552
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,524
Oh, that's what
I was going to do.

553
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,738
Oh, yes, that's right.
I forgot. It's your
occupation, isn't it?

554
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:33,449
Yeah, well, don't you think
it's kind of a waste
for the two of us...

555
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,368
To wander separately?
Uh-huh.

556
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,954
But only one is a wanderer.

557
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,373
Two together are
always going somewhere.

558
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,793
No, I don't think
that's necessarily true.

559
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,837
You left your door open.

560
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,089
Be right back.

561
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,258
How old?

562
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,469
Oh, some 2,000 years or more.

563
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,929
The oldest
living things.

564
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,472
Yes.

565
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,391
You've never
been here before?

566
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,143
No.

567
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,604
What are
you thinking?

568
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,148
Of all the people who've
been born and have died,

569
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,858
while the trees
went on living.

570
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,696
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living."

571
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,699
I don't like them.
Why?

572
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,784
Knowing
I have to die.

573
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:19,055
Here's a cross section of one of the old
trees that's been cut down.

574
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,833
Somewhere in here,
I was born,

575
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,462
and there I died.

576
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:57,343
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.

577
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:54,400
Madeleine.

578
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,321
Madeleine,
where are you now?

579
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,240
Here with you.
Where?

580
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,659
Tall trees...

581
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,911
Have you
been here before?

582
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,371
Yes.
When?

583
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,125
When were you born?

584
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,419
Long ago.
Where?

585
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,422
When? Tell me.

586
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,132
Madeleine, tell me.
No!

587
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,134
Madeleine, tell me
what it is.
Where do you go?

588
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,677
What takes you away?
No, I can't tell you.

589
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,596
When you jumped
into the bay, you didn't
know where you were.

590
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:24,889
You guessed,
but you didn't know.
I didn't jump.

591
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,849
I didn't jump. I fell.
You told me I fell.
Why did you jump?

592
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,517
Why did you jump?
I can't tell you.

593
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,186
Why did you jump?
What was there inside

594
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,104
that told you to jump?
No, please. Please.

595
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,564
What? What?

596
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:38,152
Please don't ask me.
Please don't ask me.
Take me away from here.

597
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,864
Shall I take you home?

598
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,659
Somewhere in the light.

599
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,037
Promise me something.
Promise you won't
ask me again.

600
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,997
Please promise me that.

601
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,117
Why did you run?

602
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,245
I'm responsible
for you now.

603
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,789
You know, the Chinese say
that once you've saved
a person's life,

604
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,584
you're responsible
for it forever,
so I'm committed.

605
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,169
I have to know.

606
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,548
There's so little
that I know.

607
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:49,306
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor

608
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,813
that once was mirrored,
and fragments of that mirror
still hang there.

609
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,525
And when I come to the end
of the corridor,

610
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,861
there's nothing but darkness.

611
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:06,615
And I know that when
I walk into the darkness,

612
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,286
that I'll die.

613
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,958
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back
before then.

614
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,461
Except once.

615
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,004
Yesterday?

616
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,256
And you didn't know.
You didn't know
what happened

617
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,383
till you found
yourself with me.

618
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,051
You didn't know
where you were.

619
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,889
But the small scenes,
the fragments of the mirror,
you remember those.

620
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,266
Vaguely.
What do you remember?

621
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:36,353
There's a room,
and I sit there alone.

622
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,647
Always alone.

623
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,065
What else?

624
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,484
A grave.

625
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,610
Where?

626
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:47,072
I don't know.
It's an open grave and I...

627
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,743
I stand by the gravestone,
looking down into it.

628
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,870
It's my grave.
But how do you know?

629
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,622
I know.

630
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,333
But is there a name
on the gravestone?

631
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:02,838
No. No, it's new
and clean and waiting.

632
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,758
Well, what else?

633
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,178
This part is a dream.
I think.

634
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:16,227
There's a tower, and a bell
and a garden below.

635
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:20,272
It seems to be in Spain,
a village in Spain.

636
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,359
It clicks off and it's gone.

637
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,819
Well, a portrait?

638
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,113
Do you see a portrait?
No.

639
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:33,369
If I could just find
the key, the beginning,
and put it together, I...

640
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,162
So, explain it away?

641
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,291
There's a way
to explain it, you see.

642
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,754
If I'm mad, then
that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

643
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,716
Madeleine!

644
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,639
Oh, Scottie!

645
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:58,394
I'm not mad!
I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

646
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,897
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

647
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,024
Oh, Scottie,
don't let me go.

648
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,403
I'm here.
I've got you.

649
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,029
I'm so afraid.

650
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,333
Don't leave me.

651
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,418
Stay with me.

652
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,544
All the time.

653
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,072
Hi, Johnny.

654
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,532
Hi.

655
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,367
Did you get my message?

656
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,494
I did, indeed.

657
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:59,413
I'll get you a drink.

658
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,123
Okay.

659
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:05,252
Since when do you
go around slipping notes
under men's doors?

660
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,546
Since I stopped being able
to get them on the phone.

661
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:11,508
For a man who has nothing
to do, you're certainly
a busy little bee.

662
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,844
Where do you go
these days?

663
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,429
Just wandering.

664
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,098
Where?

665
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,600
Round about.

666
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:21,935
Oh.

667
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,438
What was this...

668
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,899
What was this desperate
urge to see me?

669
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,818
All I said in my note was,
"Where are you?"

670
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,695
Doesn't sound very
desperate to me.

671
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,115
Yeah, I detected
a little undercurrent.

672
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:40,329
Well, I just thought
that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner,

673
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,831
you'd be so grateful,
you'd take me to a movie.

674
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,418
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about
at dinner?

675
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:50,089
Oh, this and that.

676
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,965
What I've been doing?

677
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,301
Only if you want to.

678
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:57,262
I'm sure we won't
talk about anything
you don't want to talk about.

679
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,681
Naturally.

680
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,769
What have you been doing?

681
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,397
Wandering.

682
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,985
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

683
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,196
Oh, I've been having
a wonderful time.

684
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,990
I've gone back
to my first love,
painting.

685
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,158
Well, good for you.

686
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:21,537
I always said you were
wasting your time in the
underwear department.

687
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:25,207
You know, it's a living.
But I'm really excited
about this.

688
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,710
What is it?
A still life?

689
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:32,131
No. No, not exactly.
You wanna see?

690
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,799
Hmm. Yeah.

691
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,301
Matter of fact,
I thought I might
give it to you.

692
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,428
Oh?

693
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,442
Johnny!

694
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,986
It's not funny, Midge.

695
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,738
Johnny!
No.

696
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,282
Johnny, I just thought...

697
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,366
Uh-uh.

698
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,243
No.

699
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:05,122
Let's make that movie
some other night, okay?

700
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,756
Johnny!

701
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,554
Oh, Marjorie Wood, you fool!

702
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,806
Idiot!

703
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,860
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

704
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,566
Madeleine!
What's the matter?
What time is it?

705
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,320
I should have phoned you,
but I wanted to see you
and be with you.

706
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,072
Why? What's happened?

707
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,407
I had the dream.
The dream came back again.

708
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,327
Now, now, it's gonna
be all right.

709
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,622
It'll be all right.
Here, I'll get you
some brandy.

710
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,751
Just drink this down.
Here, just like medicine.

711
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,588
There now.

712
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:40,217
It was a dream.
You're awake.
You're all right now.

713
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,178
Now, can you tell me?

714
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:48,058
It was the tower again,
and the bell,
and the old Spanish village.

715
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,226
Yes?

716
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,687
Clear, so very clear
for the first time.
All of it.

717
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,021
Tell me.

718
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,108
It was a village square
and a green with trees,

719
01:09:56,234 --> 01:10:00,529
and an old whitewashed
Spanish church
with a cloister.

720
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,073
Across the green,
there was a big,
gray, wooden house,

721
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,159
with a porch and shutters
and a balcony above,
a small garden,

722
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,203
and next to it
a livery stable

723
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,080
with old carriages
lined up inside.

724
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,623
Go on.

725
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:15,002
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed
stone house,

726
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,045
with a lovely pepper tree
at the corner.

727
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,382
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

728
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:25,679
And a saloon?
Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

729
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,180
Yes.

730
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,267
It's all there.
It's no dream.

731
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,480
You've been there before.
You've seen it.

732
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,400
No, never.

733
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,527
Madeleine, a hundred miles
south of San Francisco,

734
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,446
there's an old
Spanish mission,

735
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,032
San Juan Bautista
it's called, and
it's been preserved

736
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,951
exactly as it was
100 years ago,
as a museum.

737
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:51,580
Now, think hard,
darling. Think hard.

738
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,498
You've been there before.
You've seen it.

739
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,417
No, no, I've never...
I've never been there.

740
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,044
Oh, Scottie, what is it?
I've never been there.

741
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,171
Think hard. Now go on
about your dream.

742
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,089
What was it that
frightened you so?

743
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,885
I stood alone on the green
searching for something.

744
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,304
And then I started
to walk to the church.

745
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:13,435
But then
the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark.

746
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:17,773
Being pulled
into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

747
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,276
Oh, you're going to be
all right now, Madeleine.

748
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,279
Don't you see?
You've given me
something to work on now.

749
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:26,448
I'm going to take you
down there to that mission,
this afternoon.

750
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,825
And when you see it,
you'll remember
when you saw it before,

751
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:33,872
and it'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it.
I promise you. All right?

752
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,669
Come on now.
I'll take you home.

753
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,338
No. I'll be all right.

754
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,674
You come back here
around noon.

755
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,006
Madeleine,
where are you now?

756
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,302
Here with you.
And it's all real.

757
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:14,181
It's not merely
as it was 100 years ago,
or a year ago,

758
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,726
or six months ago,
or whenever it was
you were here to see it.

759
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,687
Now, Madeleine,
think of when
you were here.

760
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,484
There were not
so many carriages then.

761
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,362
There were horses
in the stalls.

762
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,824
A bay, two black
and a gray.

763
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,162
It was our favorite place.

764
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,583
But we were forbidden
to play here.

765
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,170
Sister Teresa
would scold us.

766
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,302
Look at this.
Well, here's your gray horse.

767
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,057
Have a little trouble getting
in and out of the stall
without being pushed,

768
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,517
but even so...

769
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:01,353
You see?
There's an answer
for everything.

770
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,443
Madeleine, try.

771
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,117
Try for me.

772
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,972
I love you, Madeleine.

773
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,849
I love you, too.

774
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:39,975
Too late. Too late.

775
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,810
No, no, we're together.

776
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,646
No, it's too late.
There's something
I must do.

777
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,649
No. There's nothing
you must do.

778
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,901
There's nothing
you must do.

779
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,906
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

780
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,248
No, it's too late.

781
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,637
Look. It's not fair.
It's too late.

782
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,015
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.
It shouldn't have happened.

783
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,601
It had to happen.
We're in love.
That's all that counts.

784
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,479
Look, let me go.
Please let me go!
Listen to me. Listen to me.

785
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,320
You believe I love you?

786
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:34,571
Yes.

787
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,325
And if you lose me,
then you'll know I...

788
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,702
I loved you and I wanted
to go on loving you.

789
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:41,953
I won't lose you.

790
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,708
Let me go into
the church, alone.

791
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,084
But why?

792
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:15,654
Madeleine!

793
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,830
Madeleine!

794
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,126
Ferguson.

795
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:41,132
Mr. Elster, suspecting that
all was not well
with his wife's mental state,

796
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:45,678
took the preliminary
precaution of having her
watched by Mr. Ferguson,

797
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,098
lest any harm befall her.

798
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,225
And you have heard that
Mr. Elster was prepared

799
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,936
to take his wife
to an institution,

800
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:58,233
where her mental health
would have been in the hands
of qualified specialists.

801
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,111
Mr. Ferguson,
being an ex-detective,

802
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:05,740
would have seemed the
proper choice for the role
of watchdog and protector.

803
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,952
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

804
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:12,664
However, I think you'll agree
that no blame can be attached
to the husband.

805
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,583
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care was due

806
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,212
only to the need
for information
as to her behavior,

807
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,923
which he expected to
get from Mr. Ferguson.

808
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,093
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

809
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,764
He could not have anticipated
that Mr. Ferguson's weakness,
his fear of heights,

810
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:32,767
would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

811
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:35,437
As to Mr. Ferguson,

812
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,649
you have heard
his former superior,
Detective Captain Hansen,

813
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,943
from that great city
to the north,

814
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,988
testify as to his
character and ability.

815
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,615
Captain Hansen was
most enthusiastic.

816
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,785
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances,

817
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,248
Mr. Ferguson allowed
a police colleague
to fall to his death,

818
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:58,960
Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident."

819
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,964
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated

820
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,176
on having once saved
the woman's life,

821
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:11,139
when, in a previous fit
of aberration, she threw
herself into the Bay.

822
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,477
It is a pity that knowing
her suicidal tendencies,

823
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,521
he did not make
a greater effort
the second time.

824
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,276
But we are not here
to pass judgment

825
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,739
on Mr. Ferguson's
lack of initiative.
He did nothing.

826
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,451
And the law has little
to say on the subject
of things left undone.

827
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:37,624
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall

828
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,667
have any bearing
on your verdict.

829
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:44,964
He did not remain
at the scene
of the death. He left.

830
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,510
He claims he suffered
a mental blackout
and knew nothing more

831
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,804
until he found himself
back in his own apartment
in San Francisco

832
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,556
several hours later.

833
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,267
You may accept that, or not.

834
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:02,357
Or you may believe that
having once again allowed
someone to die,

835
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,027
he could not face
the tragic result
of his own weakness

836
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,612
and ran away.

837
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,742
That has nothing to do
with your verdict.

838
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:16,454
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

839
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,960
Now, from the evidence
of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster

840
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:24,796
prior to her death, from
the manner of her death,

841
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,048
and from the postmortem
examination of the body

842
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,217
showing the actual cause
of her death,

843
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,929
you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict,
gentlemen.

844
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,139
You may retire if you wish.

845
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,851
Hold on, Mr. Jones.

846
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,333
We've reached a verdict.

847
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,793
Thank you.

848
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,383
"The jury finds
that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide

849
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,136
"while of unsound mind."

850
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,139
Your verdict will be
so recorded. Dismissed.

851
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,771
All right, Scottie,
let's go.

852
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,273
Mind if I speak to him
for a minute?

853
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,649
No, go ahead.

854
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,027
Scottie.

855
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,950
Sorry, Scottie.
That was rough.

856
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,536
He had no right
to speak to you
like that.

857
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:42,582
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

858
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,710
No, there's nothing
you have to say to me.

859
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,379
I'm getting out,
Scottie, for good.

860
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,548
I can't stay here.

861
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:55,470
I'm going to wind up
her affairs and mine,
get away as far as I can.

862
01:22:56,889 --> 01:23:00,600
Europe, perhaps.
And I probably never
will come back.

863
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,479
Good-bye, Scottie.

864
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:09,108
If there's anything
I can do for you
before I go.

865
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,404
There was no way
for them to understand.

866
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,908
You and I know
who killed Madeleine.

867
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,502
Come on, Scottie.
Let's get out of here.

868
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:38,800
It's Mozart,
Wolfgang Amadeus.

869
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,471
I had a long talk
with that lady
in musical therapy, Johnny,

870
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,140
and she says that
Mozart's the boy for you,

871
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,893
the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

872
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,564
Well, it's what
the lady said.

873
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:59,821
You know, it's wonderful
how they have it all
taped now, John.

874
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,323
I have music
for dipsomaniacs,

875
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,869
and music for melancholiacs,
and music for hypochondriacs.

876
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,833
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files
mixed up.

877
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:25,763
I brought a lot of
other things, and you
can see what you like.

878
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,974
It shuts off automatically.

879
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:39,902
Oh, Johnny.
Johnny, please try.
Try, Johnny.

880
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:43,197
You're not lost.
Mother is here.

881
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,120
Time?

882
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,205
Okay.

883
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,667
I'll be in again, John.

884
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,503
You want me
to shut that off?

885
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,859
Oh, John-O.

886
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,112
You don't even know
I'm here, do you?

887
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,242
But I'm here.

888
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,010
Nurse, could I see
the doctor for a moment?

889
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,346
Doctor, Miss Wood.

890
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,099
Won't you go in, please?

891
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,393
Yes, Miss Wood?

892
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:58,940
Doctor, how long is it
going to take you
to pull him out of this?

893
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:02,568
Well, it's hard to say.
At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

894
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,195
It really could
depend on him.

895
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,030
He won't talk.

896
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,784
No. He's suffering
from acute melancholia,

897
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,786
together with
a guilt complex.

898
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,454
He blames himself
for what happened
to the woman.

899
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,499
We... We know little
of what went on before.

900
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,586
Well, I can
give you one thing.
He was in love with her.

901
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:25,049
Oh, that does complicate
the problem, doesn't it?

902
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,385
I can give you
another complication,

903
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,303
he still is.

904
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:30,972
And you want to
know something, Doctor?

905
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:34,016
I don't think Mozart's
going to help at all.

906
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:05,941
Where'd you get this car?

907
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:07,693
I beg your pardon?
This... This car?

908
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:10,613
Why, I bought it from
a man who used to live here,
in this apartment building,

909
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:14,283
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him
when he moved away.

910
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,161
Oh, you knew him
and his wife.

911
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,205
The poor thing.
I didn't know her.

912
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,248
Tell me, is it true
that she really...

913
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,000
I'm... I'm sorry.

914
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,524
Good evening.
Good evening.

915
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:13,926
Give me a scotch and soda,
will you.

916
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,962
Well, what is it?

917
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,172
Could I ask you
a couple of questions?

918
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,590
What for? Who are you?

919
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,301
My name is John Ferguson.

920
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,510
Is this some kind
of Gallup poll?

921
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:03,220
Oh, no.

922
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,473
There are just couple
of things I'd like to ask.
You live in this hotel?

923
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:09,184
No. I happened to see
you when you came in,
so I thought...

924
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,437
Yeah, I thought so.
A pickup.

925
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:15,441
Well, you've got a nerve,
following me right into
the hotel and up to my room.

926
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:16,942
Now, you beat it.
Go on and beat it.

927
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:19,320
No, please, please.
I just want
to talk to you.

928
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:20,738
Listen, I'm gonna
yell in a minute.

929
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,615
Listen, I'm not
gonna hurt you.
Honest. I promise.

930
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,953
Please. Just
let me talk to you.

931
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:29,997
What about?
You.

932
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,540
Why?

933
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,917
Because you remind me
of somebody.

934
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,587
I heard that one
before, too.

935
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,840
I remind you of someone
you used to be
madly in love with,

936
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,009
but then she ditched you
for another guy,

937
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,928
and you've been carrying
the torch ever since.

938
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,681
Then you saw me
and something clicked.

939
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,768
Well, you're not
far wrong.

940
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,020
Well, it's not gonna work,
so you better go.

941
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,022
Please, let me come in.

942
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,985
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you.
Please.

943
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,282
Well, I warn you,
I can yell awful loud.

944
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,284
Now, you won't have to.

945
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:13,832
Well, you don't look very
much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

946
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,001
I want to know
your name.
Judy Barton.

947
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,337
Who you are?
I'm just a girl.
I work at Magnin's.

948
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,881
No, but, how do you
happen to be living here?

949
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,716
It's a place to live,
that's all.

950
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,551
No, but you haven't
lived here long?

951
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:25,928
Yeah, about three years.

952
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,346
Well, where did
you live before?

953
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,972
Salina, Kansas.

954
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,976
Listen, what is this?
What do you want?

955
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:35,396
I just want to know
who you are.

956
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,147
Well, I told you.

957
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:42,069
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

958
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,613
I work at Magnin's,
and I live here.

959
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:47,991
My gosh, do I have
to prove it?

960
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:57,793
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

961
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:01,588
Judy Barton,
number Z296794,

962
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,716
425 Maple Avenue,
Salina, Kansas.

963
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:11,807
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

964
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:16,270
A California license
issued May 25, 1954.

965
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,983
You want to check
my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

966
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:26,321
And whether you're
satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

967
01:36:30,577 --> 01:36:33,495
Gee, you have got it bad,
haven't you?

968
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,000
Do I really look like her?

969
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:45,257
She's... She's dead,
isn't she?

970
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,973
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

971
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,524
Yes, that's me
with my mother.

972
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:07,488
And that's my father.
He's dead.

973
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,157
My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy,

974
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,827
so I decided
I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

975
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,080
I've been here three years.

976
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:18,916
Honest.

977
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,886
Will you have dinner with me?

978
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,179
Why?

979
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,681
Well, I just feel that
I owe you something
after all this.

980
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:36,016
You don't owe me anything.

981
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,018
Well, then will you?
For me?

982
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,520
Dinner and what else?

983
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,021
Just dinner.

984
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,649
'Cause I remind you of her?

985
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:46,443
Because I'd like
to have dinner with you.

986
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:52,324
Well, I've been
on blind dates before.

987
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:57,037
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

988
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,540
Okay.

989
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,667
All right, I'll get my car.
I'll be back for you
in half an hour.

990
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:04,795
Oh, no, you better
give me time to change
and get fixed up.

991
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,129
An hour?

992
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,131
Uh-huh.
Okay.

993
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:05,332
Dearest Scottie.

994
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,584
And so you found me.

995
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:10,253
This is the moment that
I dreaded and hoped for.

996
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:14,174
Wondering what
I would say and do
if I ever saw you again.

997
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,260
I wanted so
to see you again,
just once.

998
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:20,305
Now I'll go,
and you can give up
your search.

999
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:22,182
I want you to have
peace of mind.

1000
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,810
You've nothing
to blame yourself for.

1001
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:26,395
You were the victim.

1002
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:31,358
I was the tool, and you were
the victim of Gavin Elster's
plan to murder his wife.

1003
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:36,029
He chose me to play the part
because I looked like her.
He dressed me up like her.

1004
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:40,367
It was quite safe because
she lived in the country
and rarely came to town.

1005
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,328
He chose you
to be the witness
to a suicide.

1006
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,873
The Carlotta story
was part real,
part invented,

1007
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:50,585
to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted
to kill herself.

1008
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:55,382
He knew of your illness.
He knew you'd never get up
the stairs to the tower.

1009
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,385
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.

1010
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:02,431
I made the mistake.
I fell in love.

1011
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,225
That wasn't part of the plan.

1012
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:09,646
I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.

1013
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,524
If I had the nerve,
I'd stay and lie,

1014
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:15,235
hoping that I could make
you love me again

1015
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,196
as I am for myself.

1016
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:21,575
And so forget the other
and forget the past.

1017
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:26,079
But I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.

1018
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:45,051
Oh, here.
Here, I'll do it.

1019
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,054
There you are.

1020
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:49,681
Thanks again.
Good night.

1021
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,641
Can I see you tomorrow?

1022
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,227
Tomorrow night? Well...

1023
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,479
No, I mean
tomorrow morning.

1024
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:01,067
But I have to go to work.
I've got a job.

1025
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,319
Don't go to your job.

1026
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:05,363
And what'll I live on?
My oil wells in Texas?

1027
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,657
Let me take care
of you, Judy.

1028
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,995
Thanks very much,
but no thanks.

1029
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,873
No, Judy,
you don't understand.

1030
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,750
Oh, I understand,
all right.

1031
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:19,419
I've been understanding
since I was 17.

1032
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:22,756
And the next step is?
No, no. No, no.

1033
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,258
No? Then what?

1034
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,970
We could just see
a lot of each other.

1035
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:31,514
Why?

1036
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:34,851
'Cause I remind you of her?

1037
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:42,025
It's not very complimentary.

1038
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:46,029
And nothing else?

1039
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,157
No.

1040
01:44:49,241 --> 01:44:51,534
That's not very
complimentary, either.

1041
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,162
I just want to be with you
as much as I can, Judy.

1042
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:13,431
Well, I guess I could phone
the store in the morning

1043
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:17,227
and make some excuse.

1044
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:25,545
There you are.

1045
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,715
I like that one.

1046
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:30,133
Like that?

1047
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,342
Yes.
All right.

1048
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,386
Well, that's very nice.

1049
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:35,013
It's beautiful.

1050
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,140
There we are.

1051
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,435
Now, we'll get this,
and then we'll buy you
those clothes.

1052
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:42,771
Honest?
Right over there's
Ransohoffs.

1053
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,064
It's the best.
How much is that?

1054
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,316
That'll be 50 cents.
Thank you.

1055
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,692
Scottie,
you don't have to.

1056
01:46:47,777 --> 01:46:49,235
But I want to.

1057
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:14,135
No, that's not it.
Nothing like it.

1058
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,012
But you said gray, sir.

1059
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:19,099
Now, look. I just want an ordinary,
simple gray suit.

1060
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,601
But I like
that one, Scottie.

1061
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,603
No, no.
It's not right.

1062
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,314
Gentleman seems
to know what he wants.

1063
01:47:27,358 --> 01:47:29,359
All right. We'll find it.

1064
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:37,784
Scottie, what
are you doing?

1065
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,452
I'm trying
to buy you a suit.

1066
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:44,165
But... But I love the
second one she wore.

1067
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,625
And this one,
it's beautiful.

1068
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:48,086
No, no. They're
none of them right.

1069
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:51,881
Oh, I think I know
the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

1070
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,384
Let me go and see.
We may still have that model.

1071
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,802
Thank you.

1072
01:47:57,972 --> 01:48:01,057
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

1073
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:02,475
You want me to be
dressed like her.

1074
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,935
Judy, I just want you
to look nice.

1075
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,645
I know the kind of suit
that'd look well on you.

1076
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:08,523
Oh, no. No, I won't do it!

1077
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:12,360
Judy.

1078
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,322
Judy, it can't make that
much difference to you.
I just want to see...

1079
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:19,826
No, I don't want any clothes.
I don't want anything.
I want to get out of here.

1080
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,411
Judy, do this
for me.

1081
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,079
Here we are.

1082
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:24,164
Yes, that's it.

1083
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,665
I thought so.

1084
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,668
I don't like it.
No, we'll take it.

1085
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:29,919
Will the thing fit?

1086
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:34,382
Well, yes. It might need some slight
alterations, but it's madam's size.

1087
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:37,218
All right, dear.
We'll have it for you
to try on in a moment.

1088
01:48:37,303 --> 01:48:38,720
How long will the
alterations take?

1089
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:40,305
Well...

1090
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:41,639
May we have it
by tonight?

1091
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:43,808
Well, if it's
absolutely necessary.

1092
01:48:43,893 --> 01:48:47,437
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like
to look at a dinner dress,
an evening dress.

1093
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:51,608
Short, black, with
long sleeves, and
a kind of square neck.

1094
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:52,901
Scottie!

1095
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:57,906
My! You certainly do know
what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

1096
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:08,875
All right. That's it.
Do you have them in brown?

1097
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:10,793
Yes, we have.
Fine.

1098
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:20,803
Here, Judy.
Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

1099
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:21,930
Stop.

1100
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,018
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

1101
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,978
I don't know.

1102
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,981
I don't know.
No good, I guess.
I don't know.

1103
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:38,446
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

1104
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,115
You can, you know.

1105
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:45,745
No. You wouldn't let me.

1106
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:50,917
And I don't wanna go.

1107
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,337
Oh, Judy. Judy,
I tell you this.

1108
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:57,548
These past few days have
been the first happy days
I've known in a year.

1109
01:49:57,633 --> 01:50:00,051
I know. I know because...

1110
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,846
'Cause I remind you of her.

1111
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:08,059
And not even that very much.

1112
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:13,940
No. No, Judy.
Judy, it's you, too.

1113
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:16,359
There's something
in you that...

1114
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:22,073
You don't even want
to touch me.

1115
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:23,700
Yes. Yes, I do.

1116
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:29,664
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

1117
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:34,961
When we first started out,
it was so good. We had fun.

1118
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:39,549
And... And then
you started in
on the clothes.

1119
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:44,554
Well, I'll wear
the darned clothes
if you want me to,

1120
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:47,598
if you'll just like me.

1121
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:54,981
The color of your hair.

1122
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:56,441
Oh, no.

1123
01:51:01,447 --> 01:51:04,032
Judy, please.
It can't matter to you.

1124
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:12,373
If...

1125
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:17,587
If I let you change me,
will that do it?

1126
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:20,340
If I do what you tell me,

1127
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:23,718
will you love me?

1128
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:24,927
Yes.

1129
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,473
Yes.
All right.

1130
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,770
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

1131
01:51:43,364 --> 01:51:45,907
Here, come on.
We'll sit by the fire.

1132
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,638
I'm afraid it's going
to take several hours.

1133
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,223
The young lady
thought perhaps
you'd like to go home.

1134
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,225
And then she'll come there
as soon as she's finished.

1135
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:16,270
Well, no. You tell her
I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

1136
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:18,815
Oh, and you're sure
about the color
of the hair?

1137
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,316
Oh, yes.
It's an easy color.

1138
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:22,777
And all the rest of...
Yes, sir, we know
what you want.

1139
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,237
Thank you.

1140
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,509
Well?

1141
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:12,011
It should be back
from your face and
pinned at the neck.

1142
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,430
I told her that.
I told you that.

1143
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:18,601
We tried it.
It just didn't seem
to suit me.

1144
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,067
Please, Judy.

1145
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:32,920
Where shall
we go for dinner?

1146
01:57:33,004 --> 01:57:34,547
Anywhere you like.

1147
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,006
Ernie's?

1148
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:38,801
You have a thing
about Ernie's, don't you?

1149
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:41,470
Well, after all,
it's our place.

1150
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:46,684
Hello, my love.
Like me?

1151
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:48,144
Mmm-hmm.

1152
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:50,563
Is that the best
you can do?

1153
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,939
Come here.

1154
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,899
Oh, no. You'll muss me.

1155
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:56,944
Well, that's what
I had in mind.
Now, come here.

1156
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,571
It's too late.
I got my face on.

1157
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:03,534
And I'm suddenly hungry.
Would you rather go
somewhere else?

1158
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:05,619
No, no. Ernie's is fine.

1159
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,330
I'm gonna have...

1160
01:58:08,874 --> 01:58:12,042
I'm gonna have
one of those big,
beautiful steaks.

1161
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:16,005
Let me see.
To start,
I think I'll...

1162
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,967
Help me with this,
will you?

1163
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:24,054
I have it.

1164
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:26,474
How do you work
this thing?

1165
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:28,142
Can't you see?

1166
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:30,603
Oh. Now,
there you are.

1167
01:58:30,687 --> 01:58:33,647
Thank you.
I'm just about ready.

1168
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:36,358
All I've got to do
is find my lipstick.

1169
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:40,154
Where did I put it?
I had it a minute ago.

1170
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:55,252
I wonder if it's here.
Here it is.

1171
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,006
There, I'm ready.

1172
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,968
But first,
muss me a little?

1173
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:09,850
Scottie, I do
have you now, don't I?

1174
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:16,732
How would you like
to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1175
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:18,984
Maybe we could drive
down the peninsula.

1176
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:21,111
All right. If you'd like.

1177
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:40,798
We're going awfully far.

1178
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:45,010
I just feel like driving.
You terribly hungry?

1179
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:47,179
No. No, it's all right.

1180
02:00:07,284 --> 02:00:09,076
Where're you going?

1181
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,958
One final thing
I have to do.

1182
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:20,379
And then, I'll be
free of the past.

1183
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:43,652
Scottie, why are we here?

1184
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,112
I told you.

1185
02:00:47,324 --> 02:00:49,533
I have to go back
into the past once more.

1186
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:53,996
Just once more,
for the last time.

1187
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,248
Why? Why here?

1188
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:58,375
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1189
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:04,048
I don't wanna go.
I'd rather wait here.
No, I need you.

1190
02:01:04,132 --> 02:01:05,174
Why?

1191
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:09,595
I need you to be
Madeleine for a while.

1192
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,306
And when it's done,
we'll both be free.

1193
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:16,936
I'm scared.
Oh, no. I have to tell
you about Madeleine now.

1194
02:01:17,604 --> 02:01:19,021
Right there.

1195
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:22,858
We stood there,
and I kissed her
for the last time.

1196
02:01:22,943 --> 02:01:24,360
And she said,
"If you lose me,

1197
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:25,611
"you'll know that
I loved you..."
Scottie.

1198
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,446
"...and wanted to
keep on loving you."

1199
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:31,367
And I said,
"I won't lose you."
But I did.

1200
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:34,370
And then she turned

1201
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:37,873
and ran into the church.

1202
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,472
And when I followed her,
it was too late.

1203
02:01:58,103 --> 02:01:59,853
I don't wanna go in there!

1204
02:01:59,938 --> 02:02:01,522
It's too late.

1205
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,360
Scottie, I...

1206
02:02:09,406 --> 02:02:13,450
I couldn't find her,
and then I heard
footsteps on the stairs.

1207
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:15,661
She was running
up the tower.

1208
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:17,079
Right here.

1209
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:20,457
Scottie...
See? She was running
up the stairs,

1210
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:23,460
through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

1211
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,630
And I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

1212
02:02:26,715 --> 02:02:29,341
I tried,
but I couldn't
get to the top.

1213
02:02:29,426 --> 02:02:31,802
One doesn't often
get a second chance.

1214
02:02:31,886 --> 02:02:34,013
I want to stop
being haunted.

1215
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:38,225
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

1216
02:02:38,309 --> 02:02:40,144
Take me away!

1217
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:43,856
You look like
Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

1218
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,108
No!
Go up the stairs.

1219
02:02:48,528 --> 02:02:50,446
Go up the stairs, Judy.

1220
02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:53,907
And I'll follow.

1221
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,762
This was as far
as I could get,
but you went on.

1222
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:59,431
Remember?

1223
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:04,103
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

1224
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:05,896
I remembered the necklace.

1225
02:04:06,022 --> 02:04:08,607
Let me go!
No. We're going up
the tower, Madeleine.

1226
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,692
You can't!
You're afraid!

1227
02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:15,030
Now, we'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

1228
02:04:15,115 --> 02:04:16,198
Scottie, please!

1229
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:19,118
But you knew that day
that I wouldn't be able
to follow you, didn't you?

1230
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:21,620
Who was up there
when you got up there?
Elster and his wife?

1231
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:23,789
Yes.
Yes, and she was
the one who died.

1232
02:04:23,873 --> 02:04:25,707
The real wife, not you.

1233
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:28,252
You were the copy.
You were the counterfeit,
weren't you?

1234
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:31,004
Was she dead or alive when...
Dead! Dead!
He'd broken her neck.

1235
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:34,299
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances,
was he?

1236
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,718
So, when you got up there,
he pushed her off the tower,

1237
02:04:36,803 --> 02:04:39,179
but it was you
that screamed.
Why did you scream?

1238
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:42,307
I wanted to stop it,
Scottie. I ran up
to stop it. I...

1239
02:04:42,392 --> 02:04:44,726
If you wanted to stop it,
why did you scream,

1240
02:04:44,811 --> 02:04:46,812
since you tricked me
so well up to then?

1241
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:50,983
You played the wife
very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

1242
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:54,444
He made you over
just like I made you
over, only better.

1243
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,530
Not only the clothes
and the hair,

1244
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:59,241
but the looks,
and the manner,
and the words,

1245
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,993
and those beautiful
phony trances.

1246
02:05:01,077 --> 02:05:03,245
And you jumped into
the Bay, didn't you?

1247
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:06,415
I'll bet you're
a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you? Aren't you?

1248
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:08,208
Aren't you?
Yes!

1249
02:05:08,293 --> 02:05:12,921
And then what did he do?
Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?

1250
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:16,008
Did he tell you exactly
what to do, what to say?

1251
02:05:16,092 --> 02:05:20,512
You were a very apt pupil,
too, weren't you?
You were a very apt pupil.

1252
02:05:20,597 --> 02:05:22,973
Why did you pick on me?
Why me?

1253
02:05:23,057 --> 02:05:24,892
Your accident!
Your accident.

1254
02:05:24,976 --> 02:05:27,102
My accident...

1255
02:05:27,187 --> 02:05:29,188
I was the setup,
wasn't I?

1256
02:05:29,272 --> 02:05:32,858
I was the setup.
I was a made-to-order
witness. I...

1257
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,574
I made it.

1258
02:05:42,452 --> 02:05:44,912
I made it.
What are you going to do?

1259
02:05:47,624 --> 02:05:50,542
We're going up
and look at the
scene of the crime.

1260
02:05:50,627 --> 02:05:52,127
Come on, Judy.

1261
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:06,642
And this is
where it happened.

1262
02:06:08,478 --> 02:06:11,313
And the two of you
hid back there
and waited for it to clear,

1263
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:14,900
and then you sneaked down
and drove into town,
is that it?

1264
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:17,819
And then?
You were his girl?

1265
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:20,614
Well, what happened to you?

1266
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:23,992
What happened to you?
Did he ditch you?

1267
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:26,870
Oh, Judy, with all
of his wife's money,
and all that freedom,

1268
02:06:26,955 --> 02:06:30,165
and that power,
and he ditched you.
What a shame.

1269
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:34,795
But he knew he was safe.
He knew you couldn't talk.
Did he give you anything?

1270
02:06:34,879 --> 02:06:36,046
Some money.

1271
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:39,258
And the necklace,
Carlotta's necklace.

1272
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:42,761
And there was where you
made your mistake, Judy.

1273
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:45,681
You shouldn't keep
souvenirs of a killing.

1274
02:06:46,683 --> 02:06:48,767
You shouldn't have been...

1275
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:52,854
You shouldn't have been
that sentimental.

1276
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:58,360
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1277
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:01,363
Scottie.

1278
02:07:02,824 --> 02:07:04,866
I was safe
when you found me.

1279
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:07,202
There was nothing
that you could prove.

1280
02:07:07,287 --> 02:07:11,873
When I saw you again,
I couldn't run away.
I loved you so.

1281
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:14,501
I walked into danger
and let you change me
because I loved you,

1282
02:07:14,585 --> 02:07:16,628
and I wanted you.

1283
02:07:16,713 --> 02:07:20,424
Oh, Scottie.
Oh, Scottie, please.

1284
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:23,427
You loved me.
Now, keep me safe.

1285
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:24,803
Please!
Too late.

1286
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:27,597
It's too late.
There's no bringing
her back.

1287
02:07:27,682 --> 02:07:28,890
Please.

1288
02:07:40,737 --> 02:07:42,404
-No!
-I heard voices.

1289
02:07:46,826 --> 02:07:48,410
God have mercy.
