1
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,682
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:20,470
You got a date with justice,
One-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:23,297
Too bad, Sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,496
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,575
Whoa!  Whoa!

6
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,251
I think you dropped something, mister.

7
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,020
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

8
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,821
You've reached the end of the line!

9
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:50,369
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

10
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,291
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

11
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,538
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

12
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,416
Ooh!

13
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,946
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

14
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,078
Whoo-hoo!

15
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,330
- Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
- Hee-yah!

16
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,590
Hold him steady!

17
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,337
Woody, hurry!

18
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,816
No!

19
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,682
Glad I could catch the train!

20
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:09,050
Now let's catch some criminals.

21
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,858
To infinity and beyond!

22
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,380
Whoo-hoo!

23
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:18,448
Ooh!

24
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,215
Reach for the sky.

25
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,654
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

26
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:34,858
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

27
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,636
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

28
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,974
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

29
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,242
Huh?

30
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,716
Evil Dr Pork Chop!

31
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,800
That's Mr Evil Dr Pork Chop to you.

32
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,304
“Buzz,
shoot your laser at my badge.”

33
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,673
“Woody, no. It'll kill you.” “Just do it!”

34
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,217
“You're going to jail, Bart.”
“Watch out!”

35
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,011
Mom!

36
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:13,153
No, no, no. Just keep
playing. Just pretend I'm not here.

37
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,251
Oh, no, Molly!

38
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:18,122
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

39
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,926
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

40
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,163
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

41
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,145
Come on.
Say “Happy birthday” to Molly.

42
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,570
- Happy birthday!
Oh, charming.

43
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,100
Happy birthday!

44
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,674
Look how tall you're getting.

45
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,079
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

46
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,385
“I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!”

47
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,017
“Got it, Woody.”

48
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:52,334
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

49
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,090
“Good work, Buzz.”

50
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,970
Yee-haw!

51
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:23,120
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

52
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,321
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

53
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,058
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

54
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:29,826
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

55
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,263
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

56
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:34,270
Yes. No.

57
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,334
I mean, why would
I mind squeezing next to you?

58
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:39,536
Is it hot in here?

59
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:40,830
Oh! Here they come!

60
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,374
Sarge, you got it?

61
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:46,800
Mission accomplished.

62
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,008
Hooray!

63
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,285
Careful. Careful!

64
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:53,716
Ooh!
- Oh!

65
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,852
All right, guys. We got one shot at this.
Everyone ready?

66
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:58,854
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

67
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:00,919
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

68
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,072
Target is on approach.

69
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:18,751
Just like
we rehearsed it, guys.

70
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,120
Hello?

71
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,630
Hello? Anyone there?

72
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,495
Molly, stay out of my room!

73
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,628
I wasn't in your room.

74
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:45,733
Then who was messing
with my stuff?

75
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,172
It wasn't me.

76
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,876
Well, that went well.

77
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,851
He held me! He actually held me!

78
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,948
Oh, this is just sad.

79
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:03,450
Who we kiddin'?
The kid's 17 years old.

80
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,262
We ain't ever
gettin'?played with.

81
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:10,726
Guys, hey, hold up.

82
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,559
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

83
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,853
Not again!

84
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,363
Oh, come on. Slink,
gather everyone up.

85
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,185
Uh, we are gathered, Woody.

86
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:21,897
Okay. First off,

87
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:26,037
we all knew Operation Playtime
was a long shot.

88
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,632
More like a misfire.

89
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,677
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about…

90
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:33,810
Being there for Andy. We know.

91
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,768
But we can try again! Right?

92
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,918
I'm callin'?it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

93
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,118
What?

94
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,522
Andy's going to college any day now.

95
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,524
- That was our last shot.
- Oh.

96
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,125
We're going
into attic mode, folks.

97
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,060
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

98
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,164
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

99
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:55,801
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

100
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:58,970
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

101
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,772
Yeah, but now it's here.

102
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,175
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see…

103
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,261
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

104
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,546
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

105
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:10,632
- Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?

106
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,254
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

107
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:15,653
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

108
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,621
we army guys are the first to go.

109
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:20,424
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

110
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:24,161
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

111
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:27,293
You're gonna need it.

112
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,200
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

113
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,969
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

114
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,037
How do you know?

115
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,172
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

116
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,640
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

117
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,944
- I thought we were goin'?to the attic.
- Oh, I hate all this uncertainty!

118
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:43,012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

119
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:46,886
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

120
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,255
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

121
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:53,927
- Wheezy and Etch and…
- Bo Peep?

122
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,331
Yeah. Even Bo.

123
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,731
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

124
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:06,101
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

125
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,177
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

126
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:13,842
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm…

127
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:16,324
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

128
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,247
There's games up there,
and books, and…

129
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,316
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

130
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:24,723
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

131
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:29,024
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

132
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,526
Yeah.

133
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:34,262
And someday, if we're Iucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

134
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,827
And he'll play with us then, right?

135
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:38,833
We'll always be there for him.

136
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:42,036
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

137
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,510
and go out on a high note.

138
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,407
I'd better find my other eye.

139
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,493
Where'd you leave it this time?

140
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:51,576
Someplace dark. And dusty.

141
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:55,118
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

142
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,984
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

143
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,851
You guarantee it, huh?

144
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,944
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

145
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,552
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

146
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,205
For infinity and beyond.

147
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,891
Can I have your stereo?
No.

148
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,459
Why not?
?'Cause I'm taking it with me.

149
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,500
- Can I have your computer?
- No.

150
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,869
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

151
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,705
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

152
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,375
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

153
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,478
- Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

154
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,280
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

155
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:05,686
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

156
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,364
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

157
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,822
Why do you still have these toys?

158
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,842
Molly, out of my room!

159
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,626
Three more days and it's mine!

160
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,174
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

161
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,430
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

162
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,332
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

163
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:22,498
What kids?

164
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,737
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

165
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:26,871
What's daycare?

166
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,206
Mom.
No buts.

167
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:31,508
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

168
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,391
Poor Barbie.

169
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:45,822
I get the Corvette.

170
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,358
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

171
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,365
Like what?

172
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,428
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

173
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:53,463
- Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.

174
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,731
Maybe sell them online?

175
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:57,267
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

176
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,671
They're junk.

177
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,556
Fine. You have till Friday.

178
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:03,305
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

179
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:06,975
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

180
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:00,928
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

181
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:02,552
That's what's happening.

182
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,345
- You need a hand?
- I got it.

183
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:19,352
Here.

184
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,648
So, you gonna miss me
when I'm gone?

185
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,351
- If I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

186
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,502
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

187
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:27,887
I can't breathe!

188
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,289
- Oh, this can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

189
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:40,939
Oh!

190
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,240
Andy!

191
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,540
That's not trash.
That's not trash!

192
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,575
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think. Oh!

193
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:53,116
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

194
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,469
Okay, boy. To the curb! Hee-yah!

195
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:06,745
No, Buster! No!

196
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,402
Get up. Buster!

197
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,141
Oh!

198
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:29,513
- We're on the curb!
- Oh, I knew it would come to this!

199
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,020
Pull, everyone! Pull!

200
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,527
It won't rip!
- Oh, forget it!

201
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,230
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

202
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,464
There's gotta be a way out!

203
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,466
Oh, Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

204
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:50,826
Point. Point. Point!

205
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:55,842
Push! Push!

206
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,859
I can hear the garbage truck!

207
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:00,271
It's getting closer.

208
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,883
Oh!

209
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,153
Buzz! Jessie!

210
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,458
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

211
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,194
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

212
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,230
This doesn't make any sense.

213
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,834
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

214
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:02,336
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

215
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,006
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

216
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,774
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

217
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:08,576
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

218
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,728
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

219
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:15,281
Yee-haw! Fellas, I know what to do.

220
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,486
What the heck?

221
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:27,327
- Oh, we should've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

222
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,403
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

223
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:31,995
Now we need to go!

224
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,092
You're right. Come on.

225
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,304
- Buzz?
- Woody!

226
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,540
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

227
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,575
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

228
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:44,133
We're going to daycare!

229
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,713
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

230
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,281
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

231
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,017
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

232
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:53,986
Attic? So how did we
end up on the curb?

233
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,689
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

234
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:59,171
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

235
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,563
And called us junk!

236
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,862
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

237
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,665
Sure thing, college boy!

238
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,803
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

239
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:13,615
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

240
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,141
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

241
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:20,140
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

242
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:29,048
Oh, great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

243
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,539
Oh, it's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

244
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:44,233
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

245
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:48,607
It's just… I can't believe
she would throw me away!

246
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,028
Welcome to the club, toots.

247
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:54,411
Okay, everyone, Iisten up. We can get
back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

248
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:56,213
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

249
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,881
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

250
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,383
Andy doesn't want us anymore.

251
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,535
He was putting you in the attic!

252
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,582
He left us on the curb!

253
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:06,490
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

254
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,191
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

255
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,826
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, Ionely place

256
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:15,062
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

257
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:19,902
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
Oh, you'll see.

258
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,537
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

259
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,811
Can anyone see anything?

260
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:41,123
There's a playground!

261
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,187
Wow!

262
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,265
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

263
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,461
So much for sad
and Ionely, huh?

264
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,797
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

265
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,765
Perspective? This place is perfect.

266
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:54,237
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

267
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,407
- Hey there!
Wow!

268
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,077
Haven't seen you in ages.

269
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,823
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

270
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,283
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

271
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,552
Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

272
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,854
Hey, how are
your kids? Molly and Andy?

273
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,190
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

274
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,858
What?
- Can you believe it?

275
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:22,188
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

276
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:26,903
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

277
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:35,109
Look!
Wow!

278
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:36,741
What? What is it?

279
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,185
No, no, no.

280
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,571
What's the matter with you?

281
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,189
I can't see!

282
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,090
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

283
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,563
Yay!

284
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,598
So now what do we do?
We go back to Andy's.

285
00:20:58,638 --> 00:20:59,665
Anyone see an exit?

286
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,467
Exit, shmexit.
Let's get played with.

287
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,337
Careful. These toys might be
jealous of new arrivals.

288
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:05,438
- I want to see!
Hey!

289
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,798
- Rex!
- It's my turn!

290
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,578
New toys!

291
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,872
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

292
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,855
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

293
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,073
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

294
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,462
Oh. Thank you. May I?

295
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,700
Ooh!

296
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,969
The claw!

297
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:47,913
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

298
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,446
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I'm Lots-o'- Huggin'?Bear.

299
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:55,048
But please call me Lotso.

300
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,024
Buzz Lightyear. We come in…

301
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:01,529
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

302
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,129
Oh, look at you all. You've been
through a lot today, haven't ya?

303
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,830
Oh, it's been horrible.

304
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,966
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

305
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:13,498
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

306
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,875
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

307
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,677
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

308
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:25,052
Mr Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

309
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:27,686
All day long. Five days a week.

310
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,752
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

311
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,555
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

312
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,892
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

313
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:37,704
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

314
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:42,554
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

315
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,972
No owners means no heartbreak.

316
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:47,501
Yee-haw!

317
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,073
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

318
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:52,608
Because we're Andy's toys!

319
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:55,617
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

320
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:58,680
Well, it's his Ioss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

321
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,116
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no…
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

322
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:05,183
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

323
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:07,659
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

324
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,960
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

325
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,665
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

326
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,467
Folks, if you want to step
right this way…

327
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,574
Hi, I'm Ken.

328
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,313
Barbie. Have we ever met?

329
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:34,479
Uh-uh.

330
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:36,549
I would've remembered.

331
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,285
- Love your Iegwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

332
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,399
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

333
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,491
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

334
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:50,284
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

335
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,795
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

336
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,104
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

337
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,073
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

338
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:01,876
Spare parts, superglue,

339
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:05,808
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

340
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,780
- Think you're gettin'?old?
Wow.

341
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,415
Well, stop your worryin'.

342
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:13,252
Our repair spa will keep you
stuffed, puffed, and Iightly buffed.

343
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,402
And this, well, this is where I live.

344
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:20,793
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

345
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,295
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

346
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,563
You have everything!

347
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:29,510
Everything except
someone to share it with.

348
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:36,067
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

349
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,312
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

350
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:44,048
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

351
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:47,991
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

352
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,253
Abandoned by the same owner.

353
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,303
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

354
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,596
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

355
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:58,229
We control our own destiny.

356
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:00,856
Watch out for puddles.

357
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:04,478
And here's where
you folks'll be stayin'.

358
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:06,439
The Caterpillar Room.

359
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:09,806
Look at this place.
Wow!

360
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,837
Holy moly guacamole.

361
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,844
Jackpot, baby.

362
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,317
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

363
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,409
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:20,286
It's so beautiful!

365
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:25,623
What the… Oh. Hey, little guy.

366
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:28,158
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

367
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:29,254
It's been years.

368
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:33,562
Well, just you wait.
In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring,

369
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:36,465
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin'?of.

370
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:39,338
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

371
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:42,371
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin'?back.

372
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,402
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

373
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:45,608
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

374
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,243
- Goodbye, Mr Lotso. Thank you.
Thank you, buddy boy.

375
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:50,451
- Will I see you again?
- Oh, I'll see you tonight

376
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,986
in my dreams.

377
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,417
Ken, let's get a move on.

378
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:56,986
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

379
00:25:57,026 --> 00:26:00,822
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe,

380
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,991
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were…

381
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:04,225
- Made for each other.
- …made for each other.

382
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,027
- Yay!
- Yes.

383
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,001
Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

384
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,155
This is so exciting!

385
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:21,943
Sounds like kids to me.

386
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:25,480
Oh, I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

387
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,081
How many you reckon are out there?

388
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,628
They sound so sweet.

389
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,559
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

390
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,133
But we need to go home.

391
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,941
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

392
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:46,496
A chance to make kids happy again.

393
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,403
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

394
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,704
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

395
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,872
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

396
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:54,908
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

397
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,281
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

398
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,354
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

399
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,084
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

400
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,682
Now, I'm going home.

401
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,356
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

402
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:15,992
Buzz?

403
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,667
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

404
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,765
What?

405
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,971
And what's important now
is we stay together.

406
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:28,206
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

407
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,742
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

408
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,630
Whose name is written there?

409
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,253
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us anymore.

410
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,184
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

411
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,952
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

412
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,921
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

413
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,057
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

414
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,969
Okay, fine. Perfect.

415
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,567
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

416
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,775
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

417
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:25,091
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

418
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,365
Bullseye, no, I said, “Stay!”

419
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:33,599
Look,

420
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,508
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

421
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:44,238
Bonnie?

422
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,915
Bonnie?

423
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:48,082
I gotta go.

424
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,671
Bonnie, you in here?

425
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:16,577
Come on. Come on.
Oh, no, no.

426
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:57,883
What… What the heck?

427
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:01,781
Now, that's better.

428
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:05,525
Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells…

429
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:09,921
There you are.
Come on, honey. It's time to go home.

430
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,515
Oh! No, no, no, no!

431
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:18,164
Reach for the sky!

432
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:22,570
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny…

433
00:31:28,912 --> 00:31:31,472
You're my favorite deputy.

434
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,395
Bonnie!
- Coming!

435
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,787
Great.

436
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,995
Oh, it's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

437
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:55,831
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

438
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,501
Ah, he's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

439
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,168
Toys are for playtime.

440
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,339
Oh, speaking of playtime,
they're Iining up out there!

441
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,374
How many?
There must be dozens.

442
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:06,675
I can hardly wait!

443
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,114
Places, everyone!

444
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,493
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

445
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,660
- Uh, Rex?
- Come to papa.

446
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,063
There's a snake in my boot.

447
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:29,555
I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.

448
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:30,562
A sheriff!

449
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,193
Move over, Mr Pricklepants.

450
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,895
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

451
00:33:38,104 --> 00:33:42,939
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to… Have to…

452
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,065
Be right back!

453
00:33:46,077 --> 00:33:48,006
Psst! Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

454
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:50,876
Can you tell me where I am?

455
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,377
The guy's just asking a question.

456
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:55,651
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

457
00:33:57,055 --> 00:34:00,118
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

458
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:01,352
Hello, I'm Trixie.

459
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:05,323
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

460
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:08,593
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

461
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,428
I'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

462
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:12,333
with life-changing news.

463
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,932
We do a lot of improv here. Just stay
loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

464
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,041
- No, no, no, no. I…
- Who wants lunch?

465
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,701
Bee-boop-bee-boop.

466
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:24,579
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

467
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:27,845
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

468
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:31,377
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

469
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,460
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

470
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:42,815
“I know where to hide.”

471
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,529
She'll never find us in here.

472
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,872
What's wrong?

473
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:55,738
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

474
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:58,608
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

475
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:00,343
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

476
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,748
There is no way out.

477
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,414
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

478
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:07,550
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

479
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,852
- Uh, Woody.
- Woody?

480
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,720
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

481
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,455
'Cause now's your chance to change it,
new room and all.

482
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:16,003
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

483
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:18,961
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

484
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,063
- Well, actually…
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

485
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:24,366
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have… My hat!

486
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:26,835
- Told ya.
I found a spaceship!

487
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,001
Showtime.

488
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,618
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

489
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:34,671
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

490
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,580
Three, two, one, blastoff!

491
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,046
Yee-haw!

492
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:45,557
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

493
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,828
Oh, I got a kink in my slink.

494
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:02,250
My tail! Where's my tail?

495
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:09,634
Someone need a hand?

496
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,145
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

497
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,480
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

498
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,681
Honey, the mustache?

499
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:18,087
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

500
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:20,954
Andy never played with us like that.

501
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,956
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

502
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,791
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

503
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:27,193
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

504
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,561
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

505
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:29,662
With the big kids!

506
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:30,764
That's right.

507
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:32,599
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

508
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,335
I'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

509
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:40,710
Blast. Try that one.

510
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,940
It's locked!

511
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,262
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

512
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:48,124
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

513
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:49,915
Finest childproof lock in the world.

514
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:51,980
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

515
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:54,071
Did anyone notice the transom?

516
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,104
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

517
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:02,492
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two…

518
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:04,364
- Three!
- Whoa!

519
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:07,630
Let go!

520
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:20,573
Go!

521
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:27,569
He did it!
Yes, sir!

522
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,953
Way to go, Buzz!

523
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,926
Yeah,
you think they had a fun playtime?

524
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:36,893
They might hear you.

525
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:41,031
- Okay, now you start.
- I…

526
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,265
- Love…
- You.

527
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:44,734
See? That time, I said “love.”
Okay, now me first.

528
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:45,869
- Okay, okay, okay.
I…

529
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,370
Love…
You.

530
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,206
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

531
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:50,907
You are so smart.

532
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:52,796
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

533
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,955
I'll wait up for you.
Kisses!

534
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,408
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

535
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:01,676
- Come on. Any splits?
Heya. Bring it here.

536
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:02,776
All right.
Here we go.

537
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:03,844
Come on, horsey, come on!

538
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:04,945
Come on, turkey,
come on, turkey.

539
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:06,547
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
Come on, horsey.

540
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:07,554
Come on, duck.

541
00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:09,583
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
Come on! Right here.

542
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:10,717
Let me have the duck, let
me have the duck,

543
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:11,852
let me have the duck!

544
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,453
Here is a duck.

545
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:15,088
- I won!
Ah, man!

546
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:18,892
Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

547
00:39:18,932 --> 00:39:20,794
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

548
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,196
- Coyote's wild.
Here, here.

549
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,797
- Two greens here.
Changing two double A's.

550
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,999
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

551
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,802
Oh, please! Landfill!

552
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,399
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

553
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,307
But that space guy, he could be useful.

554
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,343
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

555
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:38,611
Neither are you, Chunk.

556
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,181
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

557
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,750
Hey, Iay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

558
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,690
Aw, Mr Softy over here.

559
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,888
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

560
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,858
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

561
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:55,076
Ah, all them toys are disposable.

562
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:57,761
We'll be Iucky if they last us a week.

563
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,632
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

564
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,070
Let me go!

565
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:09,931
Take him to the Iibary.

566
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:11,105
No!

567
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,463
1225 Sycamore.

568
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,880
Psst. Woody, what are you doing?

569
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,345
I gotta get outta here.

570
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:51,015
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

571
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:52,883
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

572
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:55,252
but, you see, I belong to someone else.

573
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:58,389
- Who's “Yid-nuh”?
- I believe it's pronounced “Yid-nay.”

574
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,293
Guys, it says “Andy.”

575
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:01,624
He's my Bonnie.

576
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:03,893
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

577
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,595
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

578
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:10,602
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

579
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,523
I'll fire up the computer.

580
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,080
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!

581
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,708
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

582
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:25,723
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can…

583
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:31,319
Ken? What's goin'?on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

584
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:33,440
He got out, Lotso.

585
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:39,700
“Got out”? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

586
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:44,272
F- A-Oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

587
00:41:44,706 --> 00:41:46,968
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

588
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,271
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

589
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,605
for me and my friends.

590
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:53,642
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

591
00:41:53,682 --> 00:41:55,479
Well, request granted!

592
00:41:55,617 --> 00:41:57,982
- But, Lotso…
- Hush now, Kenneth.

593
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:01,384
This toy's shown initiative, Ieadership.

594
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:04,051
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

595
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:06,582
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

596
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:12,626
We're calling you up
to the big Ieagues, son.

597
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,504
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

598
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:17,665
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

599
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:20,265
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

600
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,803
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

601
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,805
But my friends don't belong there.

602
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,869
Oh, none of us do, I agree.

603
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,381
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

604
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:33,012
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

605
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:36,946
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear anymore.

606
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:40,225
Well, I guess that makes sense.

607
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:45,159
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

608
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,929
Family man, huh? I understand.

609
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,979
Put him back in the timeout chair.

610
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,705
What are ya… Unhand me!

611
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:56,798
Bring in the Bookworm.

612
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,596
Ah! Here it is.

613
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,927
It was filed under “Lightyear.”

614
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:12,008
Let's see here.

615
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:15,229
“Accessories. Maintenance.”
Oh. Here we go.

616
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,925
“Remove screws to access
battery compartment.”

617
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,285
What are you doing?

618
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:21,866
Stop!

619
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,465
Let go of me! Ow!

620
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:28,904
“To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings…”

621
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,303
No!

622
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,968
“…slide the switch from Play to Demo.”

623
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,740
Stop! No! No! No!

624
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,378
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

625
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:41,976
I'll see what it was.

626
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,384
What do you see? Anything?

627
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:50,321
No, just a dark
hallway and… Wait. Wait!

628
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,658
I see Andy!

629
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,590
- What?
- That's impossible.

630
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,138
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

631
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,899
My other eye!
The one I left behind.

632
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,240
This is so weird. He's packing up.

633
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:11,606
Uh-oh. Oh, here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

634
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,797
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

635
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,817
He's looking in the attic.

636
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,254
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

637
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:25,054
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

638
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:29,655
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

639
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,265
He's looking for us?

640
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:34,263
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

641
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:37,032
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

642
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:38,734
Well, then, Woody was telling the truth.

643
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,769
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

644
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,371
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

645
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:45,312
Guys, we gotta… We gotta go home!

646
00:44:47,816 --> 00:44:49,181
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

647
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,746
How y'all doin'?this fine evenin'?

648
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:54,115
Thank goodness!
Have you seen Buzz?

649
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:56,551
There's been a mistake. We have to go.

650
00:44:56,591 --> 00:45:01,085
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

651
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:04,192
We were runnin'?Iow on volunteers
for the little ones.

652
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:06,938
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

653
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:10,064
“Love”? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

654
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:12,038
Just look at my pocketbook!

655
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:13,195
Hmm.

656
00:45:13,308 --> 00:45:17,664
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't Ieavin'?Sunnyside.

657
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:21,177
“Sweet potato”!
Who do you think you're talking to?

658
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:25,844
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect…

659
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:28,428
Ah… That's better.

660
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:31,118
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

661
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:33,253
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

662
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:35,022
Come on, guys. We're goin'?home.

663
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:36,250
Whoa there, missy.

664
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,246
You're not goin'?anywhere.

665
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:41,028
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

666
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:44,634
Buzz! You're back!

667
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:46,424
- Hoo-yah!
Buzz?

668
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:48,262
Hey!

669
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,637
Look out!

670
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,264
What are you, nuts?

671
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:53,400
Buzz!

672
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,525
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

673
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:01,847
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

674
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:04,016
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

675
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,551
- “Zurg”?
- “Galactic Alliance”?

676
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:06,580
Oh, boy.

677
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:09,422
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock?'em up!

678
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:10,517
Yes, sir!

679
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,797
Ow!

680
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,769
Where do you think you're going?

681
00:46:24,142 --> 00:46:25,803
Buzz! We're your friends!

682
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,890
Spare me your Iies, temptress.

683
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:29,441
Your emperor's defeated,

684
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:32,575
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

685
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:35,312
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

686
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,182
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!

687
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:38,212
Not him.

688
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:41,886
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

689
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:43,655
Take him to the box.

690
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,523
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

691
00:46:46,563 --> 00:46:47,962
Bad baby! Bad baby!

692
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:49,589
Ken? What's going on?

693
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:53,003
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

694
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,698
What are you doing to my friends?

695
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:56,205
Get in there!

696
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,670
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

697
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,178
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did…

698
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,610
- And give me my scarf back!
- Ow!

699
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:11,053
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

700
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:14,084
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

701
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:18,254
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

702
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,076
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

703
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:24,390
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

704
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:27,364
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

705
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,799
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night…

706
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,291
In the box! We get it.

707
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:35,473
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

708
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:39,108
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

709
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,510
Don't worry, Commander.

710
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:44,048
Any doubt I had
got pounded out of me at the academy.

711
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:46,003
Listen up, folks.

712
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,984
We got a way of doin'?things
here at Sunnyside.

713
00:47:49,024 --> 00:47:51,720
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

714
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,070
life here can be a dream come true!

715
00:47:54,863 --> 00:47:57,889
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

716
00:47:58,734 --> 00:48:04,331
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin'?yourselves.

717
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:07,936
Woody! What did you do to him?

718
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,808
You all get a good night's rest.

719
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,119
You got a full day
of playtime tomorrow.

720
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:23,554
1225 Syca…

721
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:27,321
Who's Velocistar237?

722
00:48:27,361 --> 00:48:29,824
Oh! That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

723
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,293
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

724
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,247
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

725
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:37,332
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

726
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:40,581
Please don't be far. Please, please!

727
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:44,704
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

728
00:48:44,744 --> 00:48:46,041
Yay!

729
00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:50,480
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

730
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,346
- Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

731
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:57,016
Hey, Iisten. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

732
00:48:57,056 --> 00:48:58,151
you tell?'em Woody made it home.

733
00:48:58,191 --> 00:49:01,388
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

734
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:03,291
Well, it wasn't easy.

735
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,046
What do you mean “escape”?

736
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,227
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

737
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:13,862
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

738
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,200
Lotso?

739
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:19,004
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

740
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:20,826
but inside, he's a monster.

741
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:23,173
But… How do you know that?

742
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:26,214
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

743
00:49:32,224 --> 00:49:34,138
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

744
00:49:35,427 --> 00:49:38,089
He was a good toy. A friend.

745
00:49:38,964 --> 00:49:42,592
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

746
00:49:44,168 --> 00:49:47,035
I was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

747
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:51,202
Daisy loved us all.

748
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:52,868
But Lotso,

749
00:49:53,377 --> 00:49:55,140
Lotso was special.

750
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,808
They did everything together.

751
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,019
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

752
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,789
One day, we took a drive.

753
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:10,053
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

754
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:13,173
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

755
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:24,033
She never came back.

756
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:31,108
Lotso wouldn't give up.

757
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:38,713
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

758
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,993
But by then, it was too late.

759
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:02,305
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

760
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,603
Something snapped.

761
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:06,907
She replaced us. Come on!

762
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:10,714
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

763
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:11,908
Didn't she?

764
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:16,805
She don't love you no more!

765
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:19,283
Now come on!

766
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:29,595
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

767
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:35,892
Then we found Sunnyside.

768
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:49,731
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

769
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,449
He wasn't anyone's friend.

770
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:59,595
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

771
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,798
So how'd you get out?

772
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,568
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

773
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,516
Other toys, they weren't so Iucky.

774
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:12,540
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

775
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:14,828
they don't stand a chance.

776
00:52:15,514 --> 00:52:17,944
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

777
00:52:17,984 --> 00:52:20,350
Returning now would be suicide!

778
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:22,216
But what about your Andy?

779
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:25,222
Isn't he leaving for college?

780
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,139
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

781
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,272
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

782
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,714
But he ain't ever comin'?back.

783
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,976
Rise and shine, campers!

784
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:22,636
Commander Lotso, sir!

785
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,075
All quiet, nothing to report.

786
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:28,712
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

787
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:31,326
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

788
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:32,688
Big Baby.

789
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,802
Sweetheart!

790
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:45,652
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

791
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:47,697
Uh, I don't think
those were Lincoln Logs.

792
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:51,434
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

793
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:14,852
Uh, hello?

794
00:55:14,954 --> 00:55:16,716
You shouldn't
have come back, cowboy.

795
00:55:16,756 --> 00:55:21,154
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

796
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,389
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

797
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:24,683
I made it out once.

798
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:27,596
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

799
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,141
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

800
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,794
Yeah, for how long?

801
00:55:31,904 --> 00:55:33,290
I've been here years.

802
00:55:33,605 --> 00:55:35,539
They'll never break me.

803
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:38,479
There's only one way
toys leave this place.

804
00:55:39,444 --> 00:55:42,004
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

805
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:44,345
Then it's off to the dump.

806
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,212
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

807
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:50,415
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

808
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:53,719
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

809
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,926
Well, if you're gonna get out,

810
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:00,391
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

811
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:04,762
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

812
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:05,863
Got it. What else?

813
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:08,566
Lotso has
trucks patrolling all night long.

814
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,506
Hallway, lobby, playground.

815
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:11,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

816
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,304
Eight-feet high.

817
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,173
Cinder block. No way through it.

818
00:56:15,213 --> 00:56:16,599
You go over or under.

819
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:18,776
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

820
00:56:18,816 --> 00:56:21,522
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

821
00:56:22,753 --> 00:56:25,347
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

822
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:27,013
He sees everything.

823
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,256
Classrooms.

824
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,984
Hallways.

825
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,054
Even the playground.

826
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:03,720
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

827
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:08,023
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

828
00:57:08,063 --> 00:57:10,593
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

829
00:57:12,468 --> 00:57:14,402
Recess! Come on, kids!

830
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,702
Psst! Psst!

831
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:21,901
Hey, guys.

832
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:24,377
- Woody?
- Woody!

833
00:57:24,846 --> 00:57:25,813
Woody!

834
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:27,475
Hey, hey, hey, buddy!

835
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:28,776
Thank goodness!

836
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:31,112
You're alive!
- 'Course I'm alive!

837
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,118
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

838
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:36,918
Lotso did something to him!

839
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,153
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

840
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:40,777
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

841
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,579
Return of the astro-nut.

842
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:47,390
Oh, Woody, we were wrong
to leave Andy. I was wrong.

843
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:50,211
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

844
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:53,468
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

845
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:55,803
From now on, we stick together.

846
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,704
But Andy's Ieavin'?for college.

847
00:57:57,744 --> 00:57:59,658
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

848
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,376
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

849
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,977
Tomorrow? But that means…

850
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:06,079
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

851
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,349
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

852
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:11,357
No, there is one way out.

853
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:12,925
One way.

854
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,673
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

855
00:58:23,102 --> 00:58:25,346
Springy dog.
Present.

856
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:27,199
Green guys.

857
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:29,332
Cowgirl.
Here.

858
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:30,867
Horse.

859
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:33,544
- Piggy bank.
- Yo.

860
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,160
Tyrannosaurus.
Here.

861
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:38,231
Barbie.
Here.

862
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:39,982
Potato Head.

863
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:42,518
Potato Head?

864
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:46,453
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

865
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:48,824
Impossible!

866
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,484
Hey!

867
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,339
Little late
for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

868
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:09,874
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

869
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,743
Well, well, well.
You're turning out to be

870
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:13,445
quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

871
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:15,880
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

872
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,682
Yeah,
and I would've got away with it, too,

873
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,084
if it weren't for you meddling toys!

874
00:59:19,124 --> 00:59:20,851
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

875
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,020
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

876
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,588
You're a purse with Iegs.

877
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,542
Ow! Take him back to the box.

878
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:31,221
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

879
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,597
Really. No, no, no!

880
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:35,262
Okay, check.

881
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:39,470
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your, uh, space-guy-thingy.

882
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,842
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

883
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,038
Ken! Ken?

884
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,578
What do you want?

885
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:52,081
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

886
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,150
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

887
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,418
I was wrong.

888
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,688
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

889
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:02,292
Please take me away
from this! Take me away!

890
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:04,622
Darn it, Barbie!

891
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,663
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

892
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:11,003
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

893
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,076
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

894
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:04,387
Go get the tape!

895
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:13,868
And this is where
the magic happens.

896
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,570
Look at all your clothes!

897
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,805
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

898
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:21,041
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
I know, I know, I know.

899
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,843
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

900
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:25,512
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

901
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:28,715
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

902
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:33,558
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

903
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:38,594
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

904
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:40,565
Just a few?

905
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:48,774
Rawr!

906
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:12,321
Go get the key.

907
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:15,060
Where is it, where is it?

908
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,740
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

909
01:02:24,342 --> 01:02:26,071
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

910
01:02:27,712 --> 01:02:29,641
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?

911
01:02:29,681 --> 01:02:32,585
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

912
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:34,383
Make a move, porky!

913
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,160
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

914
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,486
- Hey! Hey!
Take that, walnut-brain.

915
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,176
No wonder you're extinct.

916
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:46,724
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

917
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:47,820
Yoo-hoo!

918
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,233
Help! Prison riot!

919
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:57,133
Get the tortilla.

920
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,108
Ready?
Ready.

921
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:48,021
Uh, Barbie?

922
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:52,988
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

923
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:54,322
And how do we switch him back?

924
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,606
You can't make me talk. You can't!

925
01:03:57,999 --> 01:03:59,847
But I'd like to see you try.

926
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:54,081
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

927
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:56,953
Oh! Barbie! Those were vintage!

928
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:58,952
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip?'em, I don't care.

929
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:00,086
They're a dime a dozen.

930
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,855
Ooh, glitter tux.

931
01:05:03,496 --> 01:05:06,862
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

932
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:08,992
Oh! A Nehru jacket.

933
01:05:09,234 --> 01:05:10,696
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

934
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:13,432
This is from what, 1967?

935
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,400
The groovy formal collection, yes!

936
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,876
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

937
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:20,606
There's an instruction manual!

938
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,414
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

939
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:27,519
Where's that manual?

940
01:05:28,754 --> 01:05:31,016
I don't know why this couldn't wait
until morning, Ken,

941
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:33,024
but here you go.

942
01:05:44,001 --> 01:05:44,968
Eesh.

943
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:47,865
What's takin'?so doggone long?

944
01:05:52,643 --> 01:05:54,212
So how do we fix Buzz?

945
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,339
What are you looking at, feathers?

946
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:16,823
Hey! Ow!

947
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:24,254
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

948
01:06:24,774 --> 01:06:25,866
Uh-oh.

949
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:29,111
Well, that's just great.

950
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,012
Help! Prison riot!

951
01:06:37,052 --> 01:06:39,448
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Oh, give it up. No one can hear you.

952
01:06:39,488 --> 01:06:42,423
- What?
- I said, “No one can hear you.”

953
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:45,387
- What?
- He said, “No one can…”

954
01:06:45,427 --> 01:06:47,473
Shush! Will you be quiet?

955
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,984
Woody! You're back!

956
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:54,063
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

957
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:57,931
Star Command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

958
01:06:59,174 --> 01:07:01,003
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

959
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:02,745
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

960
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:05,715
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

961
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:09,377
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

962
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:11,613
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

963
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,349
Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

964
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:16,517
- “insert paperclip…”
- Rex, use your finger!

965
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:18,149
What?

966
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:20,021
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

967
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:23,124
“Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds.”

968
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,631
It's not my fault!

969
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:39,840
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!

970
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,552
Uh… Amigos! We're all amigos.

971
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,325
We gotta switch him back.

972
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,260
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

973
01:08:02,401 --> 01:08:04,330
We don't have time for this.
Come on, EI Buzzo.

974
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:10,269
Good luck, cowboy.

975
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:12,751
Good luck, cowboy.

976
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:17,243
Here they come.

977
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:21,186
Come on, Buzz!

978
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:24,474
What took you so long?

979
01:08:24,557 --> 01:08:26,852
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

980
01:08:26,892 --> 01:08:28,257
We haven't seen him.

981
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:31,718
Buzz.

982
01:08:41,072 --> 01:08:42,403
Did you fix Buzz?

983
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:44,672
- Uh, sort of.
- Behind you.

984
01:08:45,043 --> 01:08:46,305
Someone's coming.

985
01:08:49,914 --> 01:08:52,911
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

986
01:08:52,951 --> 01:08:54,646
Darling! Are you okay?

987
01:08:54,753 --> 01:08:57,244
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

988
01:08:57,355 --> 01:09:00,448
You've lost weight. And so tall.

989
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,433
Ah! You're a sight for detachable eyes.

990
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:11,134
All clear.

991
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:16,328
Come on. Come on.

992
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:19,763
We're almost there.

993
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:26,294
Back up. Back up!

994
01:09:32,321 --> 01:09:33,515
Come on.

995
01:10:51,799 --> 01:10:52,823
Woody!

996
01:10:55,068 --> 01:10:56,916
Come on. We're almost there.

997
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:07,943
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

998
01:11:19,826 --> 01:11:21,760
Oh, way to go, Buzz. Come on.

999
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:29,125
- Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

1000
01:11:35,574 --> 01:11:38,016
Woody? You okay?
Yeah.

1001
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:40,272
Come on down. But not all at once.

1002
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:41,373
What did he say?

1003
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:42,508
I think he said, “All at once.”

1004
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,909
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

1005
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:45,929
Geronimo!
Look out!

1006
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,922
Thanks, Jess.

1007
01:11:50,022 --> 01:11:50,382
Thanks, Jess.

1008
01:11:51,924 --> 01:11:53,177
Almost there, guys.

1009
01:11:53,691 --> 01:11:55,653
Slink, you think you can make it?

1010
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:59,521
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

1011
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:03,294
He did it!
All right, Slinkykins.

1012
01:12:03,334 --> 01:12:04,995
Okay, climb across.

1013
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,600
You lost, little doggie?

1014
01:12:13,444 --> 01:12:15,810
Well, well. Look who's back.

1015
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,549
I'm sorry, cowboy.

1016
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:28,420
They broke me.

1017
01:12:28,525 --> 01:12:31,627
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

1018
01:12:31,928 --> 01:12:33,953
He don't want you no more.

1019
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:35,759
- That's a lie.
Is it?

1020
01:12:35,799 --> 01:12:37,460
Tell me this, Sheriff.

1021
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:40,801
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

1022
01:12:41,171 --> 01:12:43,349
You think you're special, cowboy?

1023
01:12:43,406 --> 01:12:47,638
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1024
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:50,873
Speak of the devil.

1025
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,949
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

1026
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:02,683
and you need to avoid that truck.

1027
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:06,659
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1028
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:10,693
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a Iiar and a bully!

1029
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:14,730
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1030
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,534
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1031
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:20,487
not from the threat of force.

1032
01:13:21,242 --> 01:13:23,107
If that's what you want.

1033
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:28,105
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1034
01:13:28,216 --> 01:13:32,572
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1035
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:34,806
Not to me, there's not.

1036
01:13:35,056 --> 01:13:36,045
Oh!

1037
01:13:36,157 --> 01:13:38,682
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1038
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:43,092
Oh, Ken!

1039
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:44,357
Everyone, Iisten!

1040
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:48,296
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1041
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:51,065
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1042
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:52,887
and he put himself on top!

1043
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:54,907
Anyone concur with Ken?

1044
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,773
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1045
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:05,545
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1046
01:14:05,585 --> 01:14:07,519
Wait! What about Daisy?

1047
01:14:09,823 --> 01:14:11,585
I don't know what you're talking about.

1048
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:14,288
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1049
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:16,790
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
No.

1050
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,161
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

1051
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:21,062
She replaced you.

1052
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,062
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1053
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:25,965
You Iied to Big Baby
and you've been Iying ever since.

1054
01:14:27,106 --> 01:14:29,502
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

1055
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:30,796
She never loved me.

1056
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:33,186
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1057
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:37,983
Mama.

1058
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:40,885
What? You want your mommy back?

1059
01:14:40,986 --> 01:14:43,758
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1060
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:48,876
Push?'em in. All of?'em!

1061
01:14:49,594 --> 01:14:52,657
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1062
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:57,293
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1063
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,971
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1064
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:06,617
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1065
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:11,876
He's gone!
- Holy cow.

1066
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,472
Come on. Hurry!

1067
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:26,290
Oh, for crying out Ioud!

1068
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:31,688
Woody!

1069
01:15:36,373 --> 01:15:38,102
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1070
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:41,535
Come on!

1071
01:15:43,046 --> 01:15:44,035
Barbie, no!

1072
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:49,673
Woody!

1073
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:54,815
No!

1074
01:15:59,295 --> 01:16:01,457
Can you hear me?
Is everyone okay?

1075
01:16:01,497 --> 01:16:05,391
Of course not,
you imbecile. We're doomed!

1076
01:16:06,335 --> 01:16:08,315
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1077
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:12,274
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1078
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:18,640
Against the wall, everybody.
Quick!

1079
01:16:20,849 --> 01:16:22,150
Buzz!

1080
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,812
They'll never make it!

1081
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,259
Look out!

1082
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:50,134
Buzz!

1083
01:16:57,151 --> 01:17:00,319
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

1084
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:05,148
Buzz, you okay?

1085
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:08,327
Buzz! Buzz!

1086
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:19,966
That wasn't me, was it?

1087
01:17:20,006 --> 01:17:24,070
Oh, Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1088
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,635
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1089
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:29,026
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1090
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:32,218
Woody! So where are we now?

1091
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:35,291
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1092
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:50,112
Hold on, we're going in!

1093
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:07,112
You got all your pieces?

1094
01:18:07,152 --> 01:18:08,710
The claw!

1095
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,084
My babies!
Hey, guys! No! No!

1096
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:15,870
No!

1097
01:18:21,465 --> 01:18:22,659
Hang on!

1098
01:18:35,846 --> 01:18:37,232
Woody! What do we do?

1099
01:18:37,315 --> 01:18:39,426
We'll be okay if we stay togeth…

1100
01:18:40,317 --> 01:18:41,909
- Woody!
- Slinky!

1101
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:45,454
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1102
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,418
Don't worry, Slink,
we'll get you down.

1103
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,834
You might wanna take a look at this.

1104
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:56,012
Quick! Grab something metal!

1105
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:02,369
You heard the guy.

1106
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,003
It's not working!

1107
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,875
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1108
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:17,752
Help, please! Help!

1109
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,543
Woody!

1110
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,303
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

1111
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:27,762
Woody!

1112
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:38,663
Go, go!

1113
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:46,077
Thank you, Sheriff.

1114
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,642
We're all in this together.

1115
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:48,774
Right, guys?

1116
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:51,273
Guys?

1117
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,713
Woody! Down here!

1118
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,392
- Woody!
Oh, boy.

1119
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,725
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1120
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,559
We're gonna be okay!

1121
01:20:05,465 --> 01:20:06,489
Hey!

1122
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:09,214
I don't think that's daylight.

1123
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:16,302
Run!

1124
01:20:32,993 --> 01:20:34,487
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1125
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:36,586
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1126
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:37,685
Come on!

1127
01:20:39,532 --> 01:20:41,523
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1128
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:50,233
Hurry!

1129
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:56,450
Just push it! Push it!
Push it!

1130
01:20:57,183 --> 01:20:59,515
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1131
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:01,178
No. No!

1132
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,409
Lotso!

1133
01:21:04,756 --> 01:21:05,882
No!

1134
01:21:23,108 --> 01:21:24,075
Rex!

1135
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:32,241
Buzz! What do we do?

1136
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:54,457
The claw.

1137
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:25,319
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1138
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:26,613
I take it all back.

1139
01:23:26,927 --> 01:23:29,236
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

1140
01:23:35,101 --> 01:23:37,865
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1141
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:42,903
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

1142
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,407
My boys!

1143
01:23:45,511 --> 01:23:46,705
Daddy!

1144
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,309
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1145
01:23:49,349 --> 01:23:51,611
Yeah. I'd like to Ioosen his stitchin'.

1146
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:54,176
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1147
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:05,123
Hey!
What you got?

1148
01:24:05,163 --> 01:24:07,737
I had me one of these when I was a kid.

1149
01:24:08,901 --> 01:24:10,266
Strawberries.

1150
01:24:14,106 --> 01:24:17,002
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1151
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:25,943
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1152
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,383
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

1153
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:31,135
What about you guys? I mean,

1154
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:34,462
maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

1155
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:39,221
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

1156
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,361
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
Wait a minute!

1157
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:45,096
Wait, I'll check!

1158
01:24:45,202 --> 01:24:46,999
Andy's still packing.

1159
01:24:47,104 --> 01:24:49,129
But he's almost done!

1160
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,070
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

1161
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:09,853
Come on, Buster.

1162
01:25:09,893 --> 01:25:11,288
Is that it, honey?
You got everything?

1163
01:25:11,328 --> 01:25:13,056
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1164
01:25:13,096 --> 01:25:14,063
Okay. Come on.

1165
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:18,929
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1166
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:20,869
All right. Go. Go, go!

1167
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:30,479
Okay. All clear.

1168
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:36,577
Oh!

1169
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,582
Oh, there you are.

1170
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:48,911
There you go.
- Buzz.

1171
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:55,830
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1172
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:58,266
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1173
01:25:59,807 --> 01:26:02,401
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

1174
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:05,348
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1175
01:26:06,014 --> 01:26:06,981
Sure thing.

1176
01:26:08,249 --> 01:26:11,013
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1177
01:26:11,486 --> 01:26:14,546
'Course I will. Besides, I know about

1178
01:26:16,124 --> 01:26:17,285
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

1179
01:26:17,325 --> 01:26:19,120
Honey, you want
some food for the road?

1180
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,535
I'll get something on the way.

1181
01:26:22,029 --> 01:26:24,273
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1182
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:40,007
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1183
01:26:40,047 --> 01:26:42,042
Mom, we've said goodbye
like 10 times.

1184
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:47,353
Oh, Andy.

1185
01:26:54,727 --> 01:26:56,820
Mom, it's okay.

1186
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,277
I know. It's just…

1187
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:05,903
I wish I could always be with you.

1188
01:27:08,207 --> 01:27:09,799
You will be, Mom.

1189
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,385
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1190
01:27:27,425 --> 01:27:29,687
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1191
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:33,621
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1192
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:41,936
I'm gonna miss you.
Don't, Andy.

1193
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:46,267
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1194
01:27:46,644 --> 01:27:48,206
Come on.
Get the rest of your things.

1195
01:27:48,246 --> 01:27:51,413
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1196
01:27:57,921 --> 01:27:58,977
Hey.

1197
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:09,899
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

1198
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,062
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1199
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:43,759
“Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!”

1200
01:28:43,799 --> 01:28:47,329
“Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts.”

1201
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:50,075
“Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!”

1202
01:28:50,105 --> 01:28:51,595
Splat! Splat! Splat!

1203
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:53,274
Mom.

1204
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:55,710
- Andy?
- Hi.

1205
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:57,856
Wow. Look at you.

1206
01:28:58,079 --> 01:28:59,574
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1207
01:28:59,614 --> 01:29:01,479
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1208
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,676
So, what can we do for you?

1209
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,911
Uh, I have some toys here.

1210
01:29:06,188 --> 01:29:08,817
Ooh. You hear that, Bonnie?

1211
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:10,620
So, you're Bonnie?

1212
01:29:11,826 --> 01:29:12,793
I'm Andy.

1213
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,797
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1214
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:20,759
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1215
01:29:24,104 --> 01:29:27,470
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1216
01:29:32,246 --> 01:29:35,910
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1217
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:39,980
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1218
01:29:41,622 --> 01:29:42,850
Yee-haw!

1219
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:43,946
Here.

1220
01:29:57,537 --> 01:30:02,201
This is Rex, the meanest, most
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1221
01:30:08,181 --> 01:30:12,208
The Potato Heads. Mr and Mrs
You gotta keep?'em together,

1222
01:30:12,518 --> 01:30:14,485
'cause they're madly in love.

1223
01:30:14,953 --> 01:30:18,582
Now Slinky here is
as Ioyal as any dog you could want.

1224
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,454
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1225
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,240
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr Pork Chop.

1226
01:30:30,102 --> 01:30:33,402
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1227
01:30:33,438 --> 01:30:34,735
Pizza Planet.

1228
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:37,669
And this

1229
01:30:40,145 --> 01:30:43,443
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1230
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:46,611
Look, he can fly and shoot Iasers!

1231
01:30:47,184 --> 01:30:51,144
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1232
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,724
To infinity and beyond!

1233
01:30:56,027 --> 01:30:59,657
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1234
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:04,627
They mean a lot to me.

1235
01:31:10,574 --> 01:31:11,870
My cowboy!

1236
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,910
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1237
01:31:19,082 --> 01:31:21,676
- “There's a snake in my boot.”
- Wha…?

1238
01:31:23,753 --> 01:31:26,261
There's a snake in my boot.

1239
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:44,233
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1240
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:48,032
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1241
01:31:48,777 --> 01:31:50,108
And kind. And smart.

1242
01:31:51,747 --> 01:31:56,301
But the thing that makes Woody special
is he'll never give up on you.

1243
01:31:57,419 --> 01:31:58,511
Ever.

1244
01:31:59,455 --> 01:32:02,117
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1245
01:32:05,994 --> 01:32:08,766
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1246
01:32:09,797 --> 01:32:10,855
Okay then.

1247
01:32:22,176 --> 01:32:25,006
Oh, no! Dr Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1248
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:28,543
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop?'em!

1249
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:30,497
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1250
01:32:31,252 --> 01:32:33,381
And we'll actually need
the rocket.

1251
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:36,457
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1252
01:32:38,525 --> 01:32:42,089
We need to get in the
spaceship. The volcano is gonna erupt.

1253
01:32:42,129 --> 01:32:44,967
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1254
01:32:45,031 --> 01:32:46,460
You can eat
my poisonous scones!

1255
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,695
Mr and Mrs Potato Head
are in trouble.

1256
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:50,225
Get on, Woody.

1257
01:32:52,105 --> 01:32:53,732
It's my friend Woody.

1258
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:57,406
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1259
01:33:24,904 --> 01:33:26,337
Thanks, guys.

1260
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:33,005
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1261
01:33:33,045 --> 01:33:35,025
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1262
01:33:48,726 --> 01:33:50,353
So long, partner.

1263
01:33:55,366 --> 01:33:58,797
Oh, hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1264
01:33:58,837 --> 01:34:01,741
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1265
01:34:31,969 --> 01:34:33,129
New toys!

1266
01:34:45,848 --> 01:34:46,974
Noses.

1267
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:10,425
“So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

1268
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:14,060
“Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1269
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,660
“Hugs and kisses to everyone.”

1270
01:36:16,769 --> 01:36:18,464
Aw!

1271
01:36:18,571 --> 01:36:21,000
That Barbie
has some nice handwriting.

1272
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,168
Uh, Buzz,
Barbie didn't write this.

1273
01:36:26,913 --> 01:36:28,074
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!

1274
01:36:28,114 --> 01:36:29,309
- Okay, go for the…
- Triple bonus!

1275
01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:30,509
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!

1276
01:36:30,549 --> 01:36:33,321
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!

1277
01:36:33,385 --> 01:36:35,213
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1278
01:36:36,388 --> 01:36:37,912
- Yes!
- We did it!

1279
01:36:38,023 --> 01:36:39,888
High-five! Hold on.

1280
01:36:42,494 --> 01:36:44,923
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1281
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:48,592
Oh, look at this!
- Golly Bob howdy! That's me!

1282
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:51,999
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, Iookin'?good.

1283
01:36:52,104 --> 01:36:54,678
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1284
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:58,003
Whee! Whee! Whee!

1285
01:36:58,043 --> 01:36:59,600
Oh! Oh!

1286
01:37:01,779 --> 01:37:03,144
What the…

1287
01:37:05,082 --> 01:37:08,646
I told you kids!
Stay out of my butt!

1288
01:37:08,953 --> 01:37:12,389
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1289
01:37:12,757 --> 01:37:16,056
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1290
01:37:16,661 --> 01:37:18,686
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1291
01:37:18,796 --> 01:37:21,424
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1292
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,367
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1293
01:37:25,736 --> 01:37:27,698
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1294
01:37:30,306 --> 01:37:31,364
Huh?

1295
01:37:38,848 --> 01:37:40,941
I don't know what came over me.

1296
01:37:42,252 --> 01:37:43,947
Just go with it, Buzz.
