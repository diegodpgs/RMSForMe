1
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,810
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,146
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,981
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,068
WeIl, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,279
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,781
...a place in here?

7
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,591
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,843
What, more words?

9
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,513
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,392
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,395
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,025
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,239
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,201
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,078
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,708
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,043
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:08,923
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,050
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,552
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,932
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,434
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,728
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,397
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,274
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,945
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,299
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,886
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,137
That's right.

30
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,598
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,686
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,314
-Then you're a big noble fellow.
-That's right.

33
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,281
-Here you are, tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,452
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,290
-Is it there?
-Of course.

37
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,125
Headlines.

38
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,837
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,842
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,471
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,434
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,980
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,482
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,826
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,829
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,956
And you're balmy!

47
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,015
-It damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,100
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,396
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,608
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,195
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,115
-He's balmy.
-He's all right.

53
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,539
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,541
Yes?

55
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,585
You're supposed to be....

56
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,380
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,298
Always.

58
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,717
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,387
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,555
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,267
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,937
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,647
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,446
-Sorry.
-You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,075
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,745
Sorry.

68
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,581
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,043
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,755
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,259
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,929
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,639
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,808
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,145
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,938
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,275
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,278
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,115
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,452
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,620
...giving military advice.

82
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,789
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,544
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,795
To what?

85
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,506
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,802
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,847
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,475
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,603
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,147
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,732
We don't know that.

92
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,487
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,158
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,745
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,831
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,501
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,337
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,173
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,636
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,349
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,521
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,398
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,360
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,446
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,156
Salute.

106
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,703
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,705
-It's my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,792
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,046
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,258
-I have the same problem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,886
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,805
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,474
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,604
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,065
-What?
-Themistocles, sir.

116
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,902
-A Greek philosopher.
-I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,405
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,743
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,206
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,585
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,255
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,592
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,595
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,805
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sir.

125
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,100
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,103
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,359
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,780
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,617
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,953
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,541
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,460
Thank you, sir.

133
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,299
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,384
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,850
Sir?

136
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,776
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,656
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,409
-Because I'm the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,537
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,498
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,583
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,837
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,841
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,552
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,099
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,895
That's new.

147
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,856
Where are they now?

148
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,943
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,695
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,573
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,826
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,247
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,042
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,546
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,550
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,640
It is recognised that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,426
Here you may drink.

158
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,431
One cup.

159
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,816
You do not drink?

160
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,484
No.

161
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,570
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,572
I am Bedu.

163
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,197
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,823
Yes.

165
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,117
From Cairo?

166
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,994
Yes.

167
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,790
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,961
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,004
And before?

170
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,132
From Britain?

171
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,801
Yes.

172
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,512
Truly?

173
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,472
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,976
Is that a desert country?

175
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:56,314
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,109
You are not fat?

177
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,986
No.

178
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,114
I'm different.

179
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,518
Here...

180
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,770
...take it.

181
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:40,066
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,860
Take it now.

183
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,047
Bedu food.

184
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,730
Good.

185
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,231
More?

186
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,282
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,848
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,307
Yes, I know.

189
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,476
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,312
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,019
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,854
When you are ready to go...

193
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,191
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,462
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,066
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,903
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,279
Now!

198
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,632
Good?

199
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,676
It's all right.

200
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,013
This is a Harith well.

201
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,974
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,932
Turks?

203
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,584
Bedu.

204
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,841
Who is he?

205
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,146
He is dead.

206
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,023
Yes.

207
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,359
Why?

208
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,696
This is my well.

209
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,908
I have drunk from it.

210
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,661
You are welcome.

211
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,705
He was my friend.

212
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,750
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,097
-This pistol yours?
-No, his.

214
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,073
His?

215
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,908
Mine.

216
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,411
Then I will use it.

217
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,588
Your friend...

218
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,800
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,468
I know.

220
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,311
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,939
I have heard of you.

222
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
So...

223
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,530
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,284
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,246
-You've been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,167
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,503
I can both read and write.

228
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,261
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,305
What is your name?

230
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,850
My name is for my friends.

231
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,399
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,362
You are angry, English.

233
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,997
He was nothing.

234
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,041
The well is everything.

235
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,003
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,880
He knew that.

237
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,425
Salaam.

238
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,679
Sherif Ali.

239
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,099
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,851
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,520
...a silly people.

242
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,191
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,373
Come.

244
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,042
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,336
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,881
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,218
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,389
I will find it with this.

249
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,983
Good army compass.

250
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,485
How if I take it?

251
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,237
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,740
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,243
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,078
Truly.

255
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,126
God be with you, English.

256
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,185
Hey, you!

257
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,707
-I've been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

258
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,209
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

259
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,878
How did he know?

260
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,006
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,258
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,011
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

263
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,097
-Turks?
-No, an Arab.

264
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,808
Bloody savages.

265
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,646
-This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
-Yes, they're over there.

266
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,441
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,737
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,742
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

269
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,914
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,543
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,922
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

272
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,134
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,762
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

274
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,639
What I want to say is this:

275
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,558
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

276
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,602
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

277
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,606
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,777
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-I understand what you're saying.

279
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,863
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

280
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,284
Oh, my God.

281
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,787
Not again.

282
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,819
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

283
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,197
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

284
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,661
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

285
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,566
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,156
Fire back at them.

287
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,272
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,233
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,736
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

290
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,322
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,450
You were right and I was wrong.

292
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,786
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

293
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,289
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,041
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:05,629
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

296
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,673
Lawrence.

297
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,342
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:15,639
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

299
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,144
First the guns, and now this.

300
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,033
Cigarette?

301
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,701
I'm sorry.

302
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,380
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,591
Umph off.

304
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,261
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

305
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,113
Hold it, Jenkins!

306
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,911
Jenkins!

307
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,922
Lawrence?

308
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,676
You have no servant.

309
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,428
-I don't need a servant.
-No?

310
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,432
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

311
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,643
-Yes, everything.
-I don't doubt it.

312
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,980
-It will be very nice for you.
-I can't afford it.

313
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:55,507
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

314
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,469
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

315
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:05,726
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

316
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:11,315
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,861
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

318
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,323
And observe the prayers.

319
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,954
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

320
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:31,001
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

321
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:36,840
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,508
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,510
-My lord.
-Sherif Ali.

324
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,973
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, l think.

325
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,684
Yes, my lord.

326
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,481
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,025
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,361
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

329
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,030
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,699
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:07,245
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

332
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,041
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

333
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,543
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:16,880
So?

335
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,050
Yes, colonel.

336
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,137
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,057
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

338
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,228
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

339
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,397
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,399
Aqaba!

341
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,902
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

342
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,071
-But you can't!
-You could.

343
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,157
You mean, the navy?

344
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,412
The Turks have 1 2-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

345
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,622
Can you imagine what that means?

346
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,582
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:57,045
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,756
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,177
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

350
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,263
You can see that, sir, surely.

351
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,433
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

352
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,643
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,187
I must ask you not to speak like that.

354
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,107
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

355
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,110
Possibly.

356
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,072
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,950
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

358
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,327
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

359
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,456
-Guns?
-A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,625
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,129
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

362
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,382
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

363
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,303
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

364
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,221
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

365
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:52,601
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:58,356
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

367
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:05,030
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,658
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

369
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,870
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:13,872
Yes, my lord.

371
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,541
It is beautiful, is it not?

372
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,502
-Very .
-That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,839
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

374
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:28,178
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

375
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,680
Small population compared with some.

376
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,059
It's small, but it's great. And why?

377
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,187
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipline.

378
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,689
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

379
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,566
...the English go
where they please...

380
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,402
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

381
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,780
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

382
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,282
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,660
But I would like to hear his opinion.

384
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,287
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,958
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:03,463
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

387
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,260
My lord, I think....

388
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,388
I think your book is right.

389
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:16,101
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

390
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,395
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

391
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,063
...and strike where they please.

392
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,566
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

393
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,735
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

394
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,113
And this is the way you should
fight now.

395
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,948
I don't know.

396
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,450
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:37,414
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,791
-What is this to you?
-You're a traitor.

399
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,085
No, colonel.

400
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,589
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

401
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,925
They must say their say.

402
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:55,098
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

403
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,809
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

404
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,604
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,608
You tread heavily...

406
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,320
...but you speak the truth.

407
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,450
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

408
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,619
...it is late.

409
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,845
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

410
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,890
...under European officers,
does he not?

411
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,017
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,311
And l must do it...

413
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,649
...because the Turks have
European guns.

414
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,568
But I fear to do it...

415
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,696
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:57,827
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

417
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,206
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,375
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:07,212
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

420
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,799
To England and to other things.

421
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,677
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,679
And is that possible?

423
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,690
I think you are another of these
desert-loving English.

424
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,025
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,945
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,447
No Arab loves the desert.

427
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:39,703
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,206
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,921
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

430
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:53,758
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

431
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,221
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,850
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,561
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

434
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,479
...when London was a village.

435
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,566
Yes, you were great.

436
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,901
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,362
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,866
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

439
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,870
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

440
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,373
But my father is old...

441
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,084
...and I...

442
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,465
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,261
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

444
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,475
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

445
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:44,768
...or....

446
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,436
Or?

447
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,607
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,276
We need a miracle.

449
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,187
Aqaba.

450
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,970
From the land.

451
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,722
You are mad.

452
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,519
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

453
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,979
That's right.

454
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,481
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

455
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,608
I'll cross it if you will.

456
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,988
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

457
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,991
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

458
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:32,245
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

459
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,163
Fifty men?

460
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,000
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

461
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,627
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

462
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,880
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

463
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,009
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

464
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,345
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

465
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,848
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

466
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,227
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

467
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,648
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

468
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,569
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

469
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:09,866
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

470
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,702
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

471
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,166
Aqaba's over there.

472
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,920
It's only a matter of going.

473
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,382
You are mad.

474
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,059
And where are you going, lieutenant?

475
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,437
With 50 of my men.

476
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,273
To work your miracle.

477
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:46,903
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

478
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,239
-Who told you?
-Ali did.

479
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,116
Why not you?

480
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,746
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

481
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,248
Yes, I must.

482
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,585
But I will spare these to you.

483
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,590
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

484
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:12,136
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

485
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,598
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

486
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:16,849
No.

487
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,738
Since you do know...

488
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,784
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

489
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,454
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

490
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,375
But in whose name do you ride?

491
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,609
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

492
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,112
They were here. I caught them.

493
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,198
Why are you here? Boy!

494
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,325
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

495
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,203
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

496
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,289
You have been tracking us.

497
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,208
-You were told to stay.
-No, sherif.

498
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,502
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

499
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,672
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

500
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,550
-It is the will of Allah.
-Blasphemy.

501
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,051
Don't do that.

502
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:44,223
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

503
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,560
Be warned. They are not suitable.

504
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,564
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

505
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,652
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

506
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,492
One shilling, every week?

507
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,328
That is fair.

508
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,330
-Each?
-No.

509
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,165
-That is too much.
-All right.

510
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:21,969
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

511
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,610
There is the railway.

512
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:41,405
And that is the desert.

513
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,577
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

514
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:50,081
For the camels, no water at all.

515
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,875
If the camels die...

516
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,544
...we die.

517
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:59,298
And in 20 days they will start to die.

518
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,057
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

519
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,877
I was thinking.

520
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,796
You were drifting.

521
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:49,426
Yes. It will not happen again.

522
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,389
Be warned, you were drifting.

523
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,100
It will not happen again.

524
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,122
That water is wasted.

525
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,838
From now on,
we must travel by night...

526
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,008
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

527
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,677
A few hours each day.

528
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,473
Why don't we start now?

529
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,351
No. We will rest now.

530
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:23,312
Three hours.

531
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,980
Fine.

532
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,024
I'll wake you.

533
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,122
Do we rest here?

534
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,501
There is no rest now short of water.

535
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,795
The other side of that.

536
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,131
And how much of that is there?

537
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,008
I'm not sure.

538
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,472
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

539
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,809
This is the sun's anvil.

540
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,652
Have we done it?

541
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:44,031
No, but we're off the anvil.

542
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,450
Thank God for that anyway.

543
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,577
Yes, thank him.

544
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:52,414
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted him.

545
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,957
I know.

546
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,795
We've done it.

547
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,631
God willing.

548
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,801
When do we reach the wells?

549
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:08,347
God willing, midday.

550
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:12,267
-Then we've done it.
-Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

551
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,564
Gasim's.

552
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,153
What's happened to him?

553
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,447
God knows.

554
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,992
Why don't you stop?

555
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,955
For what? He will be dead by midday.

556
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,087
We must go back.

557
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,173
What for, to die with Gasim?

558
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,718
In one hour comes the sun.

559
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:52,891
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

560
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,476
I can.

561
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,979
Take the boys.

562
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,320
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

563
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,823
Gasim you have killed already.

564
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,658
Get out of my way.

565
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,829
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

566
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,372
Nothing is written!

567
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,918
Go back, then!

568
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,672
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

569
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,550
English blasphemer!

570
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,261
Aqaba?

571
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,555
Was it Aqaba?

572
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,142
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

573
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,770
Go back, blasphemer...

574
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,356
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

575
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,442
I shall be at Aqaba.

576
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,736
That is written.

577
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,654
In here.

578
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,209
English!

579
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,188
Lawrence! Daud!

580
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,735
Nothing is written.

581
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,519
Al Lawrence.

582
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,358
Farraj.

583
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,652
Wash.

584
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,566
Al Lawrence.

585
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:13,655
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

586
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,329
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

587
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,290
-Al Lawrence is better.
-True.

588
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,878
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

589
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,012
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

590
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:41,015
-Is that a lord?
-A kind of lord.

591
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,102
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

592
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:45,561
No.

593
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,524
You have an elder brother.

594
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:50,900
No.

595
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:56,197
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

596
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,701
He didn't marry my mother.

597
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,870
I see.

598
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,747
I'm sorry.

599
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:10,628
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

600
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,717
Yes, I suppose I am.

601
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,761
Al Lawrence is best.

602
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,852
All right, l'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

603
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,593
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

604
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,940
Very fine.

605
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:19,030
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

606
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:21,699
-Is it permitted?
-Surely.

607
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:31,959
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

608
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,221
They are good for riding. Try.

609
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,043
What are you doing, Englishman?

610
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,962
As you see.

611
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,298
Are you alone?

612
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,342
Almost.

613
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,436
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

614
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,104
Yours?

615
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,485
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

616
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,114
I've heard of another man
of that name.

617
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,700
Other? What other?

618
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:14,288
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

619
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,961
He must be a great hero.

620
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,879
He is.

621
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,299
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

622
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,718
Now, would he not?

623
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,140
No, that must be some other man.

624
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,520
Here is my help.

625
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:05,881
Son, what fashion is this?

626
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,886
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?

627
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,847
A Beni Wejh sherif.

628
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,349
And is he Harith?

629
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,768
No, Father, English.

630
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,356
Son...

631
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,276
...they are stealing our water.

632
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,029
Tell them we are coming.

633
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,864
Tell them.

634
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,477
-Empty that!
-Do not!

635
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,940
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

636
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:48,776
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

637
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,252
Harith.

638
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,295
Ali.

639
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,257
Does your father still steal?

640
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:14,552
No.

641
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:19,140
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

642
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,519
No. There is no resemblance.

643
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,814
Alas, you resemble your father.

644
01:31:27,274 --> 01:31:30,151
-Auda flatters me.
-You are easily flattered.

645
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,154
I knew your father well.

646
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,406
Did you know your own?

647
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:43,497
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

648
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:47,084
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

649
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:51,422
-Do you desire it?
-Not the generals in Cairo...

650
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:55,009
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

651
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,346
Call off your men.

652
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,521
This honours the unworthy.

653
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:09,940
I've only just begun to teach him.

654
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:14,445
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

655
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,697
Be not clever with me, English.

656
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:21,702
-Who is he?
-A friend of Prince Feisal's.

657
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:34,381
-So you desire my hospitality?
-Yes.

658
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,091
Is he your tongue?

659
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:38,594
We do desire it.

660
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,892
Then it is given, if you will take it.

661
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,229
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

662
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,234
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

663
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:58,405
Tomorrow, maybe l will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

664
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:00,908
But...

665
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,743
...dine with me.

666
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,579
Dine with Auda, English.

667
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,916
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

668
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:14,421
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

669
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:57,751
This thing you work against Aqaba...

670
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:00,546
...what profit do you hope from it?

671
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,340
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

672
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,676
The Harith do not work for profit.

673
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:10,597
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

674
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,600
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

675
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,770
But I....
I cannot serve.

676
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,691
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

677
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:22,943
Yes, it is my pleasure.

678
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:31,452
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

679
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:32,953
No?

680
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,665
-For the English, then?
-For the Arabs.

681
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,709
The Arabs?

682
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:43,797
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

683
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:46,008
I have even heard of the Harith.

684
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,177
But the Arabs?

685
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,804
What tribe is that?

686
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:56,643
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

687
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,896
Well, they are nothing to me.

688
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:01,023
My tribe is the Howeitat.

689
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,609
Who work only for profit.

690
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,486
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

691
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,322
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

692
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,656
Serve?

693
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,158
I serve?

694
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:14,036
It is the servant who takes money.

695
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,043
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

696
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,170
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

697
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:26,507
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
-No!

698
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:35,265
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

699
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:39,228
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

700
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:43,649
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

701
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:47,945
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

702
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:52,366
Because I am a river to my people.

703
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,209
Is that service?

704
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:04,044
No.

705
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,263
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

706
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:17,224
And lost his taste for fighting.

707
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:21,562
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

708
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:25,566
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

709
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,568
Why should they wish to?

710
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:30,779
Now....

711
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:35,576
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

712
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:38,078
...a servant's wages.

713
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:42,249
They pay me, month by month...

714
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:46,587
...1 00 golden guineas.

715
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,924
1 50, Auda.

716
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:54,094
-Who told you that?
-I have long ears.

717
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,597
And a long tongue between them.

718
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:00,142
1 00, 1 50, what matters?
It's a trifle.

719
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:04,146
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

720
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,356
In Aqaba.

721
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:10,319
-In Aqaba?
-Where else?

722
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:14,114
You trouble me like women.

723
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:17,618
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

724
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,453
-For money?
-No.

725
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:20,954
-For Feisal?
-No!

726
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:24,249
Nor to drive away the Turks.

727
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,877
He will come...

728
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,130
...because it is his pleasure.

729
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:35,802
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

730
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:40,641
Make God your agent!

731
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:46,021
Aqaba!

732
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,304
God be with you.

733
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:23,864
Yes.

734
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:25,240
Aqaba.

735
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:29,536
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

736
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:33,707
-Do you think we shall?
-Yes.

737
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,626
If you are right about the guns.

738
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:07,282
He killed. He dies.

739
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:10,243
This is the end of Aqaba.

740
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:14,748
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

741
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:15,916
Why?

742
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:19,169
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

743
01:44:19,629 --> 01:44:20,837
Ali!

744
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,089
It is an ancient wound.

745
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:26,259
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

746
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,933
It is the law, Lawrence.

747
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,435
The law says the man must die.

748
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,439
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

749
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:41,691
Yes.

750
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:46,780
Sherif Ali!

751
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:49,950
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

752
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:53,578
-...will that content the Harith?
-Yes.

753
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:02,337
Then I will execute the law.

754
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,465
I have no tribe.

755
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,010
And no one is offended.

756
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:22,482
Gasim.

757
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,405
Did you do it?

758
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,017
Well, Lawrence....

759
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:05,900
What ails the Englishman?

760
01:46:06,152 --> 01:46:09,571
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

761
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,781
It was written, then.

762
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:14,659
Better to have left him.

763
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:21,583
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

764
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:24,294
Besides, it was necessary.

765
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,589
You gave life and you took it.

766
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:29,716
The writing is still yours.

767
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,005
Auda Abu Tayi!

768
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,287
The miracle is accomplished.

769
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:29,914
Garlands for the conqueror.

770
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:54,188
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

771
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,691
I'm none of those things, Ali.

772
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:59,569
-What, then?
-Don't know.

773
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:01,946
Thanks.

774
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:05,658
My God, I love this country.

775
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:08,328
What!

776
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:11,247
No gold in Aqaba!

777
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:15,001
Auda, I found it!

778
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:25,845
That's a pity.

779
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:31,976
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

780
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,687
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

781
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:38,024
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

782
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:39,400
And you?

783
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:42,737
I'm going to tell the generals...

784
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:45,031
...in Cairo.

785
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,575
Yes, cross Sinai.

786
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:48,868
Come on!

787
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:50,536
Sinai?

788
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,372
Yes.

789
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:56,542
-With these?
-They'll be all right with me.

790
01:52:01,799 --> 01:52:05,927
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

791
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,055
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

792
01:52:09,807 --> 01:52:11,099
I see.

793
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:14,894
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

794
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:19,273
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

795
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:22,151
...and then they will believe you.

796
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,904
You're an ignorant man.

797
01:52:44,925 --> 01:52:46,342
Paper.

798
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:49,095
Paper!

799
01:52:51,807 --> 01:52:54,475
There is no gold in Aqaba.

800
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:57,437
No gold.

801
01:52:58,814 --> 01:53:00,773
No great box!

802
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:07,280
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

803
01:53:07,823 --> 01:53:10,116
For my pleasure, as you said.

804
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,870
But gold is honourable...

805
01:53:14,955 --> 01:53:17,623
...and Lawrence promised gold.

806
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:19,876
Lawrence lied.

807
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,296
See, Auda.

808
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:28,092
"The Crown of England...

809
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:31,637
...promises to pay...

810
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:37,018
...5000 golden guineas...

811
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:42,231
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

812
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:47,653
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

813
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,322
...by...

814
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:52,241
...me.

815
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:55,495
In 1 0 days...

816
01:53:56,205 --> 01:53:58,331
...I'll be back with the gold.

817
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:04,170
With gold, with guns, with everything.

818
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,839
Ten days.

819
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:09,759
You'll cross Sinai?

820
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:11,427
Why not?

821
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:13,888
Moses did.

822
01:54:16,517 --> 01:54:18,726
And you will take the children?

823
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,395
Moses did.

824
01:54:21,647 --> 01:54:23,356
Moses was a prophet...

825
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:26,442
...and beloved of God.

826
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:35,868
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

827
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:40,039
He is not perfect.

828
01:54:50,092 --> 01:54:52,552
Lord, can we not rest?

829
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,888
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

830
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,809
Have you two slept in beds?

831
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:01,269
Farraj?

832
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:03,187
Daud?

833
01:55:04,398 --> 01:55:06,065
With sheets?

834
01:55:07,985 --> 01:55:11,445
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

835
01:55:11,697 --> 01:55:12,989
I promise.

836
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,908
Then it shall be so, lord.

837
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:38,598
Look!

838
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:46,939
Pillar of fire.

839
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:52,153
No, lord. Dust.

840
01:56:41,787 --> 01:56:43,287
My compass.

841
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:46,374
No matter.

842
01:56:46,833 --> 01:56:50,544
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

843
01:56:51,672 --> 01:56:53,047
Due west.

844
01:57:13,694 --> 01:57:15,194
Come on!

845
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:51,230
Lawrence!

846
01:58:03,952 --> 01:58:05,244
Farraj!

847
01:58:15,505 --> 01:58:18,424
Farraj, don't! Don't!

848
01:58:19,468 --> 01:58:20,885
Don't!

849
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,523
Why do you walk?

850
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:02,277
But why, lord?

851
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:18,502
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

852
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:46,739
Lawrence, look!

853
02:01:55,642 --> 02:01:57,685
It's all right, Farraj.

854
02:01:57,894 --> 02:01:59,478
It's all right.

855
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:13,384
Who are you?

856
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:56,095
-Daud!
-We're here, sir.

857
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,823
You taking him in there?

858
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,325
Yes.

859
02:04:38,847 --> 02:04:40,264
Here!

860
02:04:42,183 --> 02:04:44,518
Here. You!

861
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:49,565
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

862
02:04:50,316 --> 02:04:51,817
We are thirsty.

863
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:56,071
-Mr. Lawrence, is it?
-Yes.

864
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:59,658
-Are you going to the officers' bar?
-Yes.

865
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:03,162
You can't take him in there, sir.

866
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:09,376
What do you think you look like?

867
02:05:28,062 --> 02:05:29,688
No, no. You must go.

868
02:05:29,898 --> 02:05:31,523
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

869
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:36,111
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

870
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:42,034
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

871
02:05:42,243 --> 02:05:46,079
-This is a bar for British officers.
-We are not particular.

872
02:05:51,419 --> 02:05:55,339
-Are you off your head?
-No. Oddly enough I'm not.

873
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:59,218
-Just clear out of here, will you?
-Get that boy out of here.

874
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,221
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

875
02:06:02,889 --> 02:06:05,432
-Get that wog out of here.
-Clear off.

876
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,269
What's going on?

877
02:06:12,232 --> 02:06:16,151
-It's Lawrence, sir.
-Lemonade with ice.

878
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:19,071
Explain yourself.

879
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:21,573
We've taken Aqaba.

880
02:06:22,075 --> 02:06:24,743
-Taken Aqaba? Who has?
-We have.

881
02:06:24,994 --> 02:06:29,498
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

882
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:31,583
We have.

883
02:06:33,378 --> 02:06:35,254
He likes your lemonade.

884
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:37,506
You mean the Turks have gone?

885
02:06:37,799 --> 02:06:40,759
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

886
02:06:41,261 --> 02:06:45,389
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

887
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:48,100
That's not true. We killed some.

888
02:06:48,309 --> 02:06:52,271
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

889
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:56,483
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

890
02:06:58,611 --> 02:07:02,114
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

891
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:05,117
-It isn't possible.
-Yes, it is.

892
02:07:05,451 --> 02:07:07,286
I did it.

893
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,167
You'd better talk to Allenby.

894
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,212
-General Allenby?
-He's in command. Murray's gone.

895
02:07:17,463 --> 02:07:19,715
That's a step in the right direction.

896
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:23,218
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

897
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:26,221
-Yes, of course.
-It's for him.

898
02:07:27,974 --> 02:07:30,851
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

899
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:33,145
See Allenby first, though.

900
02:07:33,813 --> 02:07:35,439
Will he see me?

901
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,691
I think so.

902
02:07:38,443 --> 02:07:39,985
Do that, then.

903
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:47,492
-I'd better shave.
-Yes, you had.

904
02:07:47,702 --> 02:07:50,329
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

905
02:08:01,507 --> 02:08:03,342
"Undisciplined.

906
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:07,179
Unpunctual.

907
02:08:08,348 --> 02:08:10,265
Untidy.

908
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,227
Several languages.

909
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:17,522
Knowledge of music...

910
02:08:18,399 --> 02:08:20,192
...literature.

911
02:08:21,235 --> 02:08:23,195
Knowledge of....

912
02:08:24,572 --> 02:08:26,365
Knowledge of...."

913
02:08:29,577 --> 02:08:32,537
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

914
02:08:33,206 --> 02:08:36,291
-Who told you to take Aqaba?
-Nobody.

915
02:08:36,584 --> 02:08:39,252
-Sir.
-Sir.

916
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:40,879
Then why did you?

917
02:08:41,047 --> 02:08:43,548
-Aqaba's important.
-Why is it important?

918
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:46,301
-It's the Turkish route to the canal.
-Not anymore.

919
02:08:46,552 --> 02:08:50,722
-They're coming through Beersheba.
-I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

920
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:55,519
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

921
02:08:56,062 --> 02:08:57,104
True.

922
02:08:57,313 --> 02:09:01,942
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

923
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:05,237
Am I going for Jerusalem?

924
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:06,738
Yes.

925
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:10,534
Very well.

926
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:13,036
Aqaba behind my right.

927
02:09:13,246 --> 02:09:16,123
It threatened El' Arîsh and Gaza.

928
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:18,834
Anything else?

929
02:09:19,085 --> 02:09:20,293
Yes.

930
02:09:20,586 --> 02:09:23,046
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

931
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:26,591
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

932
02:09:26,843 --> 02:09:30,429
No. I think you should
leave them there.

933
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:32,597
You acted without orders, you know.

934
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:37,561
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

935
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:40,105
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

936
02:09:40,314 --> 02:09:42,649
Yes, I know.

937
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:44,484
Already?

938
02:09:44,777 --> 02:09:45,944
Yes.

939
02:09:47,697 --> 02:09:50,323
I'm promoting you major.

940
02:09:51,325 --> 02:09:53,618
I don't think that's a very good idea.

941
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:56,872
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

942
02:09:57,123 --> 02:10:00,792
...and carry on the good work.

943
02:10:01,294 --> 02:10:04,129
No. Thank you, sir.

944
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:08,592
-Why not?
-Well, I, it's....

945
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:10,135
Let me see now....

946
02:10:11,846 --> 02:10:15,599
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

947
02:10:15,808 --> 02:10:18,018
One was a boy.

948
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:19,686
That was...

949
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:23,148
...yesterday.

950
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,400
I led him into a quicksand.

951
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,319
The other was a man.

952
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:29,613
That was...

953
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:32,240
...before Aqaba, anyway.

954
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:35,619
I had to execute him with my pistol.

955
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:39,164
There was something about it
I didn't like.

956
02:10:39,415 --> 02:10:42,542
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

957
02:10:44,837 --> 02:10:47,172
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

958
02:10:47,381 --> 02:10:49,508
No. Something else.

959
02:10:51,135 --> 02:10:52,719
What, then?

960
02:10:53,638 --> 02:10:56,014
I enjoyed it.

961
02:11:03,523 --> 02:11:07,025
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

962
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:12,405
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

963
02:11:12,657 --> 02:11:14,366
Yes. Entirely.

964
02:11:14,575 --> 02:11:17,702
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

965
02:11:18,037 --> 02:11:20,038
Fascinating gear they wear.

966
02:11:20,289 --> 02:11:22,541
How would I look in this, Harry?

967
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:26,253
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

968
02:11:27,171 --> 02:11:31,258
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

969
02:11:31,467 --> 02:11:34,386
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

970
02:11:35,388 --> 02:11:39,975
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

971
02:11:40,309 --> 02:11:43,311
-Brighton?
-I know what he thinks.

972
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:47,816
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

973
02:11:48,192 --> 02:11:51,069
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

974
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:54,406
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

975
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:57,826
-Mr. Perkins!
-Sir!

976
02:11:58,077 --> 02:12:00,704
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

977
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:08,128
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
-Yes, sir.

978
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:12,632
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

979
02:12:12,842 --> 02:12:15,927
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

980
02:12:21,601 --> 02:12:23,226
Come on, then.

981
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:28,607
You're a clever man, sir.

982
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:32,527
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

983
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:35,488
That's fair, surely?

984
02:12:56,010 --> 02:13:01,139
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

985
02:13:01,349 --> 02:13:03,642
-Bravo.
-You know better?

986
02:13:23,204 --> 02:13:26,039
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

987
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:28,667
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

988
02:14:05,246 --> 02:14:07,706
Easy, gentlemen, please.

989
02:14:08,874 --> 02:14:11,084
-Give us something to drink.
-Of course, sir.

990
02:14:11,585 --> 02:14:15,213
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

991
02:14:15,965 --> 02:14:17,132
Tracy.

992
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:20,885
Shall we go outside?

993
02:14:32,064 --> 02:14:35,358
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

994
02:14:35,568 --> 02:14:36,609
Yes.

995
02:14:36,861 --> 02:14:39,154
With 1 000 Arabs?

996
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:43,408
1 000 Arabs means 1 000 knives.

997
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:45,577
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

998
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:47,787
It means 1 000 camels.

999
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:52,375
That means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles.

1000
02:14:52,918 --> 02:14:56,671
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1001
02:14:57,256 --> 02:14:59,174
I'll smash his railways.

1002
02:14:59,425 --> 02:15:01,926
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1003
02:15:02,178 --> 02:15:04,971
In 1 3 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1004
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:07,599
You are going back, then?

1005
02:15:10,436 --> 02:15:11,686
Yes.

1006
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:14,439
Of course I'm going back.

1007
02:15:18,778 --> 02:15:21,196
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1008
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:25,700
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1009
02:15:25,951 --> 02:15:27,118
...he'll withdraw.

1010
02:15:27,286 --> 02:15:30,038
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1011
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:32,791
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1012
02:15:33,042 --> 02:15:35,543
-I wonder who will.
-No one will.

1013
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:38,421
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1014
02:15:44,428 --> 02:15:46,721
That's what I've told them anyway.

1015
02:15:47,181 --> 02:15:49,015
That's what they think.

1016
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:52,727
-That's why they're fighting.
-Oh, surely.

1017
02:15:55,689 --> 02:15:57,982
They've only one suspicion.

1018
02:15:58,442 --> 02:16:02,821
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1019
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:07,534
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1020
02:16:07,743 --> 02:16:08,827
Have we?

1021
02:16:09,328 --> 02:16:11,496
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1022
02:16:11,705 --> 02:16:14,833
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1023
02:16:15,835 --> 02:16:18,086
Difficult question, sir.

1024
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:23,883
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1025
02:16:24,093 --> 02:16:27,512
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1026
02:16:28,556 --> 02:16:30,056
Certainly.

1027
02:16:47,575 --> 02:16:51,035
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1028
02:16:51,245 --> 02:16:52,412
Right.

1029
02:16:52,705 --> 02:16:56,040
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1030
02:16:57,042 --> 02:17:00,420
-Instructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

1031
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:02,213
More money.

1032
02:17:02,548 --> 02:17:05,717
-How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1033
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:08,636
-Dryden?
-It can be done, sir.

1034
02:17:08,888 --> 02:17:11,723
A couple of armoured cars.

1035
02:17:11,891 --> 02:17:13,266
Right.

1036
02:17:14,018 --> 02:17:15,560
Field artillery.

1037
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,105
Right.

1038
02:17:22,067 --> 02:17:24,319
I'll give you every
blessed thing l can...

1039
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:27,447
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1040
02:17:27,656 --> 02:17:30,408
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1041
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:07,946
Congratulations!

1042
02:18:18,207 --> 02:18:21,292
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1043
02:18:21,502 --> 02:18:23,336
I was wondering that, sir.

1044
02:18:23,587 --> 02:18:25,797
Might be difficult to get it back.

1045
02:18:26,006 --> 02:18:29,592
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1046
02:18:29,802 --> 02:18:31,719
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1047
02:18:31,971 --> 02:18:33,888
-For you to say.
-No, it's not.

1048
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:36,891
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1049
02:18:37,142 --> 02:18:39,102
Not like that poor devil.

1050
02:18:39,603 --> 02:18:41,145
He's riding the whirlwind.

1051
02:18:41,355 --> 02:18:43,606
Let's hope we're not.

1052
02:24:07,347 --> 02:24:10,599
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1053
02:24:11,143 --> 02:24:12,351
To Prince Feisal.

1054
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:15,354
-You're not Prince Feisal?
-No.

1055
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:16,981
You know him though?

1056
02:24:17,149 --> 02:24:20,651
He is my master. I am his servant.

1057
02:24:23,822 --> 02:24:25,156
Can you read?

1058
02:24:33,832 --> 02:24:38,336
Chicago Courieris my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1059
02:24:38,587 --> 02:24:42,131
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1060
02:24:56,313 --> 02:24:57,480
Now....

1061
02:24:58,690 --> 02:25:02,651
-Where can I find Major Lawrence?
-Is that what you have come for?

1062
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:04,987
Not altogether, sir, no.

1063
02:25:05,238 --> 02:25:09,617
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1064
02:25:09,826 --> 02:25:12,912
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1065
02:25:13,205 --> 02:25:14,372
I don't know.

1066
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,708
-Last week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

1067
02:25:17,918 --> 02:25:21,754
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1068
02:25:22,714 --> 02:25:25,341
-I've never tried.
-Take a mule.

1069
02:25:25,884 --> 02:25:28,010
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1070
02:25:28,387 --> 02:25:31,013
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1071
02:25:31,223 --> 02:25:32,515
They do.

1072
02:25:32,724 --> 02:25:35,893
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1073
02:25:36,228 --> 02:25:37,728
Myself...

1074
02:25:38,355 --> 02:25:40,231
...I am going to Cairo.

1075
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,441
-As you know.
-Yes.

1076
02:25:42,692 --> 02:25:45,194
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1077
02:25:45,737 --> 02:25:46,946
Yes.

1078
02:25:50,534 --> 02:25:52,910
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1079
02:25:53,370 --> 02:25:55,913
-That is so.
-You're handicapped?

1080
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:58,165
It restricts us to small things.

1081
02:25:58,375 --> 02:25:59,667
It's intended to.

1082
02:26:02,379 --> 02:26:03,963
Do you know General Allenby?

1083
02:26:04,965 --> 02:26:08,426
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1084
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:11,429
-Excuse me?
-A clever man.

1085
02:26:11,721 --> 02:26:14,598
Slim customer. It's very good.

1086
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:19,437
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1087
02:26:19,729 --> 02:26:23,232
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1088
02:26:23,442 --> 02:26:25,818
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1089
02:26:26,069 --> 02:26:28,279
...who struggle for their freedom.

1090
02:26:28,447 --> 02:26:30,698
Very gratifying.

1091
02:26:33,452 --> 02:26:37,788
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1092
02:26:37,956 --> 02:26:40,291
I badly want a story to tell.

1093
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:44,295
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1094
02:26:44,963 --> 02:26:47,798
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1095
02:26:48,008 --> 02:26:49,967
And before l leave here...

1096
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:52,595
...which must be presently...

1097
02:26:52,804 --> 02:26:56,307
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1098
02:26:58,101 --> 02:27:01,353
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1099
02:27:01,605 --> 02:27:02,730
I do, sir.

1100
02:27:02,939 --> 02:27:05,858
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1101
02:27:06,109 --> 02:27:08,611
My army is made up of tribes.

1102
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:11,822
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1103
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:15,159
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1104
02:27:15,368 --> 02:27:18,454
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1105
02:27:19,039 --> 02:27:22,374
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1106
02:27:23,251 --> 02:27:26,670
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1107
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:29,507
...beyond every other man.

1108
02:27:30,175 --> 02:27:33,344
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1109
02:27:33,512 --> 02:27:37,181
...because it never leaves my head.

1110
02:27:37,682 --> 02:27:41,769
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1111
02:27:42,687 --> 02:27:45,147
...37 wounded...

1112
02:27:47,692 --> 02:27:51,028
...1 56 dead.

1113
02:27:52,572 --> 02:27:57,368
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1114
02:27:57,577 --> 02:27:58,869
Yeah.

1115
02:27:59,204 --> 02:28:00,579
Four times as many.

1116
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:05,543
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1117
02:28:05,794 --> 02:28:08,295
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1118
02:28:08,713 --> 02:28:12,383
-You mean...?
-We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1119
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:16,303
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1120
02:28:16,513 --> 02:28:21,016
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1121
02:28:21,226 --> 02:28:23,102
...and are treated harshly.

1122
02:28:23,812 --> 02:28:24,895
How harshly?

1123
02:28:25,188 --> 02:28:28,065
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1124
02:28:28,858 --> 02:28:29,900
I see.

1125
02:28:30,068 --> 02:28:33,320
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1126
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:37,366
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1127
02:28:37,576 --> 02:28:41,620
-I should like you to notice that.
-Yes, sir.

1128
02:28:42,622 --> 02:28:45,249
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1129
02:28:45,709 --> 02:28:47,084
Why should you suppose?

1130
02:28:47,335 --> 02:28:49,753
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1131
02:28:49,963 --> 02:28:52,423
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1132
02:28:52,632 --> 02:28:54,341
That is exactly so.

1133
02:28:54,551 --> 02:28:58,053
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1134
02:28:58,388 --> 02:29:01,265
With me, it is merely good manners.

1135
02:29:01,433 --> 02:29:05,603
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1136
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,607
-And now, perhaps....
-Oh, sure, sure.

1137
02:29:13,737 --> 02:29:15,404
Thank you, sir.

1138
02:29:15,614 --> 02:29:17,364
Can you manage the letter--?

1139
02:29:17,616 --> 02:29:20,451
I'll do everything I have said...

1140
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:24,246
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1141
02:29:24,456 --> 02:29:26,874
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1142
02:29:28,793 --> 02:29:31,920
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1143
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:34,632
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1144
02:29:34,966 --> 02:29:35,966
Oh, no.

1145
02:29:36,259 --> 02:29:40,012
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1146
02:29:40,263 --> 02:29:42,973
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1147
02:29:43,183 --> 02:29:45,184
And Turkey.

1148
02:29:45,477 --> 02:29:49,813
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is....

1149
02:29:50,315 --> 02:29:52,775
-Enjoyable?
-Hardly that, sir.

1150
02:29:52,984 --> 02:29:55,986
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1151
02:29:56,196 --> 02:29:59,823
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1152
02:30:01,409 --> 02:30:03,202
All right. Yes.

1153
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:05,496
Lawrence is your man.

1154
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:46,370
Stop!

1155
02:31:05,765 --> 02:31:09,601
Stop it!

1156
02:31:17,777 --> 02:31:19,278
Come on, men!

1157
02:32:28,473 --> 02:32:29,807
Lawrence!

1158
02:32:50,495 --> 02:32:52,496
Good God! God!

1159
02:33:38,877 --> 02:33:43,672
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1160
02:33:43,923 --> 02:33:46,174
Why don't you take a picture?

1161
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:47,843
Wish I had.

1162
02:33:52,056 --> 02:33:54,266
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1163
02:33:56,519 --> 02:33:57,561
Am I in this?

1164
02:33:58,563 --> 02:34:00,272
Did you take his picture?

1165
02:34:00,523 --> 02:34:01,773
Yeah.

1166
02:34:06,195 --> 02:34:10,365
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1167
02:34:12,869 --> 02:34:14,912
Charming company you keep.

1168
02:34:15,163 --> 02:34:16,413
Auda?

1169
02:34:17,206 --> 02:34:22,252
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1170
02:34:22,587 --> 02:34:24,671
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1171
02:34:24,923 --> 02:34:27,049
It's all right to take your picture?

1172
02:34:27,592 --> 02:34:29,092
-All right.
-Okay.

1173
02:34:29,302 --> 02:34:30,761
Just walk.

1174
02:35:30,989 --> 02:35:33,156
Major Lawrence!

1175
02:35:33,783 --> 02:35:36,493
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1176
02:35:44,502 --> 02:35:47,129
This looting has got to stop!

1177
02:35:47,338 --> 02:35:48,672
It is customary.

1178
02:35:48,965 --> 02:35:52,509
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1179
02:35:52,802 --> 02:35:55,012
I would not say that to Auda.

1180
02:35:55,513 --> 02:35:58,306
-It is their payment, colonel.
-Payment.

1181
02:35:58,516 --> 02:36:01,309
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1182
02:36:02,186 --> 02:36:05,522
-They don't go home when being paid.
-They are not free to.

1183
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:14,406
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1184
02:36:14,699 --> 02:36:16,324
They'll come back.

1185
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:20,078
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1186
02:36:20,371 --> 02:36:22,539
Not this year, Lawrence.

1187
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:27,711
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1188
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:30,714
-Less.
-Well, then?

1189
02:36:31,049 --> 02:36:33,383
I said, they'll come back.

1190
02:36:34,093 --> 02:36:35,302
You badly hurt?

1191
02:36:36,846 --> 02:36:38,597
Not hurt at all.

1192
02:36:38,848 --> 02:36:43,018
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1193
02:36:58,743 --> 02:37:02,579
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1194
02:37:03,039 --> 02:37:06,583
-What are you learning from this?
-Politics.

1195
02:37:07,251 --> 02:37:11,755
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1196
02:37:12,423 --> 02:37:14,716
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1197
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:18,261
Did I answer well?

1198
02:37:18,638 --> 02:37:22,849
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1199
02:37:24,102 --> 02:37:25,769
You learn quickly.

1200
02:37:27,105 --> 02:37:29,272
I have a good teacher.

1201
02:37:31,901 --> 02:37:33,276
Yeah.

1202
02:37:40,993 --> 02:37:42,869
-How's your hurt?
-Fine.

1203
02:37:43,079 --> 02:37:47,916
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1204
02:37:48,126 --> 02:37:51,169
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1205
02:37:51,462 --> 02:37:54,798
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1206
02:37:55,007 --> 02:37:56,174
One.

1207
02:37:56,634 --> 02:38:00,595
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1208
02:38:00,888 --> 02:38:03,306
They hope to gain their freedom.

1209
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:05,642
Freedom.

1210
02:38:06,936 --> 02:38:09,771
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1211
02:38:09,981 --> 02:38:13,650
-There's one born every minute.
-They're going to get it.

1212
02:38:14,443 --> 02:38:16,653
I'm going to give it to them.

1213
02:38:18,322 --> 02:38:24,161
-The second question?
-Well, I was going to ask...

1214
02:38:24,662 --> 02:38:28,623
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1215
02:38:30,626 --> 02:38:32,669
It's clean.

1216
02:38:35,506 --> 02:38:37,048
Well, now...

1217
02:38:37,925 --> 02:38:40,051
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1218
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:42,053
May I...

1219
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:45,182
...take one farewell picture?

1220
02:38:46,017 --> 02:38:49,060
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1221
02:38:49,353 --> 02:38:52,314
One clock for two lamps.

1222
02:38:52,815 --> 02:38:54,024
A fair bargain.

1223
02:38:54,233 --> 02:38:56,860
Fair? l robbed him.

1224
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:09,831
Trash.

1225
02:39:10,958 --> 02:39:13,376
I must find something honourable.

1226
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:15,212
Honourable?

1227
02:39:15,838 --> 02:39:19,591
The year is running out, Brighton.

1228
02:39:24,013 --> 02:39:27,015
I must find something honourable.

1229
02:41:58,542 --> 02:42:00,710
Now you may blow up my train.

1230
02:42:01,003 --> 02:42:02,712
And what will you do now?

1231
02:42:02,922 --> 02:42:07,509
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1232
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:10,261
They will carry my toys too, see?

1233
02:42:10,679 --> 02:42:13,723
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1234
02:42:14,016 --> 02:42:17,394
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1235
02:42:17,561 --> 02:42:22,232
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1236
02:42:22,441 --> 02:42:25,026
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1237
02:42:25,236 --> 02:42:26,903
No, I shan't, Auda.

1238
02:42:27,696 --> 02:42:29,072
Then you are a fool.

1239
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:32,742
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1240
02:42:33,869 --> 02:42:36,079
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1241
02:42:36,288 --> 02:42:39,416
...that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1242
02:42:40,668 --> 02:42:42,752
You are an impudent rascal.

1243
02:42:44,255 --> 02:42:48,591
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1244
02:42:58,978 --> 02:43:00,728
Like talking to a brick wall.

1245
02:43:09,405 --> 02:43:12,073
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1246
02:43:12,741 --> 02:43:14,451
I'll go north.

1247
02:43:15,786 --> 02:43:17,620
That's what Allenby wants.

1248
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:21,958
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1249
02:43:22,209 --> 02:43:24,461
Then that's where I'll take it.

1250
02:43:25,463 --> 02:43:30,300
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1251
02:43:30,593 --> 02:43:31,759
Won't we?

1252
02:44:04,251 --> 02:44:05,293
Train, Farraj.

1253
02:44:06,337 --> 02:44:07,837
Yeah, Lawrence.

1254
02:44:37,034 --> 02:44:38,868
Hide yourself, my friend.

1255
02:44:48,087 --> 02:44:49,546
Detonator.

1256
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:04,727
All right, fetch another.

1257
02:45:04,937 --> 02:45:08,731
-Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
-Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1258
02:45:14,196 --> 02:45:15,572
Farraj?

1259
02:45:25,874 --> 02:45:28,918
-What happened?
-Detonator. A detonator!

1260
02:45:42,433 --> 02:45:44,934
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1261
02:45:54,445 --> 02:45:57,280
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1262
02:46:09,668 --> 02:46:12,128
Daud will be angry with you.

1263
02:46:13,130 --> 02:46:15,006
Salute him for me.

1264
02:46:34,818 --> 02:46:36,486
What will you do now?

1265
02:46:37,946 --> 02:46:39,447
Go north.

1266
02:46:39,657 --> 02:46:41,115
With twenty?

1267
02:46:41,992 --> 02:46:44,452
What would
you recommend me to do?

1268
02:46:46,163 --> 02:46:48,164
What would you recommend?

1269
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:55,505
He hasn't 1/1 0 so many men, sir.

1270
02:46:55,673 --> 02:46:57,548
He's lied, in fact.

1271
02:46:58,926 --> 02:47:02,637
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1272
02:47:02,846 --> 02:47:05,515
Then there is an Arab north army.

1273
02:47:07,017 --> 02:47:11,521
-No, sir, he has lied about that.
-Any idea why?

1274
02:47:11,939 --> 02:47:15,942
-It's his army, I suppose.
-It's Prince Feisal's army.

1275
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:19,862
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1276
02:47:21,198 --> 02:47:22,824
No.

1277
02:47:23,867 --> 02:47:27,578
He would if he could, I think.

1278
02:47:29,373 --> 02:47:32,834
-Not my line of country.
-It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1279
02:47:33,544 --> 02:47:35,753
What matters is I believed it.

1280
02:47:36,046 --> 02:47:37,714
The Turks believe it.

1281
02:47:38,006 --> 02:47:41,384
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1282
02:47:43,345 --> 02:47:45,096
Good heavens.

1283
02:47:45,556 --> 02:47:49,267
-Shouldn't say he had long to live.
-Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1284
02:47:49,518 --> 02:47:53,896
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1285
02:47:55,065 --> 02:47:57,859
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1286
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:03,698
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1287
02:48:03,907 --> 02:48:05,908
I wouldn't be surprised.

1288
02:48:06,118 --> 02:48:09,746
-They think he's a kind of prophet.
-They do or he does?

1289
02:48:25,387 --> 02:48:27,930
-Now may I speak?
-Yes.

1290
02:48:28,599 --> 02:48:31,768
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1291
02:48:33,145 --> 02:48:36,647
-I do not include myself.
-I do not include the others.

1292
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:39,108
So say they love you.

1293
02:48:39,568 --> 02:48:42,069
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1294
02:48:42,279 --> 02:48:45,406
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1295
02:48:45,616 --> 02:48:47,784
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1296
02:48:48,035 --> 02:48:51,245
That's right. That's right.

1297
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:54,332
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1298
02:48:54,792 --> 02:48:58,461
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1299
02:48:59,046 --> 02:49:03,466
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1300
02:49:05,594 --> 02:49:08,554
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1301
02:49:09,056 --> 02:49:10,431
Do you?

1302
02:49:13,644 --> 02:49:16,979
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1303
02:49:20,442 --> 02:49:24,821
-Who will come with me into Deraa?
-Deraa is garrisoned.

1304
02:49:24,988 --> 02:49:27,114
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1305
02:49:27,324 --> 02:49:31,077
-I'll go by myself if I have to.
-Why?

1306
02:49:31,328 --> 02:49:33,162
Because I told the English generals...

1307
02:49:33,455 --> 02:49:37,083
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1308
02:49:37,501 --> 02:49:39,627
Or perhaps you are here...

1309
02:49:40,212 --> 02:49:42,171
...for the English generals.

1310
02:49:44,216 --> 02:49:45,883
Who says this?

1311
02:49:46,176 --> 02:49:47,510
Rumour.

1312
02:49:48,846 --> 02:49:51,347
That is not an argument.

1313
02:49:51,598 --> 02:49:53,808
Oh, argument.

1314
02:49:54,017 --> 02:49:57,353
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1315
02:49:57,646 --> 02:50:00,022
...while the Arabs argue.

1316
02:50:01,984 --> 02:50:05,111
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1317
02:50:05,487 --> 02:50:09,240
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1318
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:19,709
It's madness.

1319
02:50:23,213 --> 02:50:25,006
What are you looking for?

1320
02:50:25,215 --> 02:50:27,717
Some way to announce myself.

1321
02:50:27,926 --> 02:50:29,886
Be patient with him, God.

1322
02:50:43,275 --> 02:50:47,570
-Do you not see how they look at you?
-Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1323
02:50:47,738 --> 02:50:49,071
Halt!

1324
02:50:49,281 --> 02:50:50,531
Walk on.

1325
02:50:50,741 --> 02:50:52,575
-Halt!
-Walk on.

1326
02:50:53,744 --> 02:50:55,912
You and you.

1327
02:52:37,055 --> 02:52:38,139
You.

1328
02:52:54,698 --> 02:52:56,699
You have blue eyes.

1329
02:52:57,576 --> 02:53:01,829
-I say you have blue eyes.
-Yes, effendi.

1330
02:53:02,039 --> 02:53:05,332
-Are you Circassian?
-Yes, effendi.

1331
02:53:06,209 --> 02:53:07,793
How old are you?

1332
02:53:08,045 --> 02:53:11,047
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1333
02:53:11,298 --> 02:53:13,174
I think.

1334
02:53:13,383 --> 02:53:17,928
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1335
02:53:19,222 --> 02:53:21,307
It's an interesting face.

1336
02:53:25,937 --> 02:53:28,397
I am surrounded by cattle.

1337
02:53:29,066 --> 02:53:32,735
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1338
02:53:33,737 --> 02:53:37,740
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1339
02:53:37,949 --> 02:53:42,369
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1340
02:53:42,579 --> 02:53:44,413
...isolated.

1341
02:53:46,333 --> 02:53:48,918
You haven't the least idea
what l'm talking about.

1342
02:53:49,211 --> 02:53:50,920
No, effendi.

1343
02:53:53,465 --> 02:53:54,882
Have you?

1344
02:53:56,093 --> 02:53:57,384
No.

1345
02:53:58,095 --> 02:53:59,929
That would be too...

1346
02:54:00,138 --> 02:54:01,764
...lucky.

1347
02:54:26,248 --> 02:54:27,998
Where did you get that?

1348
02:54:29,918 --> 02:54:34,088
-It's old, effendi.
-No, this is recent.

1349
02:54:36,133 --> 02:54:38,384
-You are a deserter.
-No, effendi.

1350
02:54:38,635 --> 02:54:40,511
Yes, you are a deserter.

1351
02:54:41,638 --> 02:54:43,889
But from which army?

1352
02:54:46,393 --> 02:54:48,644
Not that it matters at all.

1353
02:54:48,979 --> 02:54:51,313
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1354
02:55:02,826 --> 02:55:04,785
Your skin is very fair.

1355
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:24,972
Beat him.

1356
02:56:59,526 --> 02:57:00,901
To me!

1357
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:05,000
Sleep.

1358
02:59:20,083 --> 02:59:21,683
Eat.

1359
02:59:32,387 --> 02:59:35,222
You have a body, like other men.

1360
02:59:43,731 --> 02:59:44,773
Good.

1361
02:59:45,942 --> 02:59:47,734
Then sleep.

1362
03:00:01,249 --> 03:00:02,499
Better?

1363
03:00:03,126 --> 03:00:05,836
Much better. You were right.

1364
03:00:06,129 --> 03:00:08,297
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1365
03:00:09,257 --> 03:00:11,300
Oh, l've learned all right.

1366
03:00:17,098 --> 03:00:18,807
I'm going, Ali.

1367
03:00:19,851 --> 03:00:21,977
-Why?
-Why?

1368
03:00:23,271 --> 03:00:24,521
Heavens.

1369
03:00:24,814 --> 03:00:26,106
Why?

1370
03:00:26,983 --> 03:00:29,234
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1371
03:00:29,486 --> 03:00:31,487
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1372
03:00:31,779 --> 03:00:34,865
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1373
03:00:35,158 --> 03:00:38,160
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1374
03:00:38,453 --> 03:00:41,455
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1375
03:00:41,664 --> 03:00:43,624
You proved it.

1376
03:00:43,833 --> 03:00:46,001
Look, Ali. Look.

1377
03:00:46,294 --> 03:00:50,047
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1378
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:53,175
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1379
03:00:53,343 --> 03:00:56,011
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1380
03:00:57,805 --> 03:00:59,264
He can...

1381
03:00:59,474 --> 03:01:02,351
...but he can't want what he wants.

1382
03:01:03,311 --> 03:01:06,522
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1383
03:01:09,359 --> 03:01:13,153
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1384
03:01:13,363 --> 03:01:17,324
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1385
03:01:17,534 --> 03:01:20,327
-I tried to.
-So would any man.

1386
03:01:20,537 --> 03:01:24,039
Well, any man is what l am.

1387
03:01:25,041 --> 03:01:29,044
And l'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1388
03:01:29,337 --> 03:01:31,380
...that any man can do.

1389
03:01:31,673 --> 03:01:33,549
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1390
03:01:33,841 --> 03:01:36,552
-I'll make easy stages.
-You?

1391
03:01:38,096 --> 03:01:41,557
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1392
03:01:43,351 --> 03:01:47,896
Look, Ali, I think l see
a way of being just...

1393
03:01:48,106 --> 03:01:49,731
...ordinarily...

1394
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:51,817
...happy.

1395
03:01:55,613 --> 03:01:57,239
Can I take this?

1396
03:01:57,865 --> 03:01:59,741
It is not clean.

1397
03:02:00,034 --> 03:02:03,078
No, but it's warm.

1398
03:02:03,454 --> 03:02:04,746
And these...

1399
03:02:04,956 --> 03:02:08,917
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1400
03:02:10,420 --> 03:02:15,591
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1401
03:02:17,844 --> 03:02:20,053
And let me go back to mine.

1402
03:02:49,167 --> 03:02:52,294
-I say, don't forget those form fives.
-All right.

1403
03:02:58,134 --> 03:02:59,968
Mind if l join you?

1404
03:03:00,803 --> 03:03:02,471
Honoured, sir.

1405
03:03:04,807 --> 03:03:08,143
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

1406
03:03:08,686 --> 03:03:11,271
-What's doing out there?
-Where?

1407
03:03:11,481 --> 03:03:13,774
-Arabia?
-Well, yes, sir.

1408
03:03:13,983 --> 03:03:17,319
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1409
03:03:17,612 --> 03:03:19,988
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1410
03:03:20,198 --> 03:03:21,657
Jolly good.

1411
03:03:22,492 --> 03:03:26,495
Well, I have to go up there.

1412
03:03:27,497 --> 03:03:29,956
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1413
03:03:30,166 --> 03:03:31,917
Bloody wogs.

1414
03:03:33,336 --> 03:03:35,212
Yes, probably.

1415
03:03:35,963 --> 03:03:38,340
Jolly good about the squash court.

1416
03:03:41,052 --> 03:03:43,553
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1417
03:03:56,818 --> 03:03:58,068
Morning.

1418
03:03:58,236 --> 03:04:00,028
-Good morning, sir.
-Good to be back.

1419
03:04:00,321 --> 03:04:03,365
-I'll believe you, sir.
-No, really it is.

1420
03:04:06,661 --> 03:04:07,994
Hello.

1421
03:04:08,579 --> 03:04:11,707
Morning. You're to go right in.

1422
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,220
Lawrence.

1423
03:04:27,014 --> 03:04:29,558
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1424
03:04:30,226 --> 03:04:31,601
Sir.

1425
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:39,234
Well, general, I will leave you.

1426
03:04:39,527 --> 03:04:42,404
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1427
03:04:42,697 --> 03:04:46,491
...about my people
and their weakness...

1428
03:04:46,743 --> 03:04:51,538
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1429
03:04:54,041 --> 03:04:57,586
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1430
03:04:57,754 --> 03:04:59,796
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1431
03:05:00,089 --> 03:05:04,551
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1432
03:05:04,761 --> 03:05:06,762
I know this treaty does exist.

1433
03:05:07,013 --> 03:05:08,930
Treaty, sir?

1434
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:13,101
He does it better than you, general.

1435
03:05:13,394 --> 03:05:16,646
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1436
03:05:30,828 --> 03:05:32,454
You really don't know?

1437
03:05:34,791 --> 03:05:36,792
Then what the devil's this?

1438
03:05:37,794 --> 03:05:41,671
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1439
03:05:41,923 --> 03:05:43,298
For what reason?

1440
03:05:43,466 --> 03:05:45,801
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1441
03:05:45,968 --> 03:05:47,344
No.

1442
03:05:48,137 --> 03:05:51,306
-I can guess.
-Don't guess. Tell him.

1443
03:05:53,100 --> 03:05:54,476
Well, now....

1444
03:05:54,936 --> 03:05:57,979
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1445
03:05:58,189 --> 03:06:01,316
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1446
03:06:01,484 --> 03:06:05,695
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1447
03:06:05,988 --> 03:06:09,324
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1448
03:06:09,617 --> 03:06:11,326
Including Arabia.

1449
03:06:11,619 --> 03:06:15,664
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1450
03:06:15,873 --> 03:06:19,000
An agreement to that effect.

1451
03:06:19,669 --> 03:06:23,213
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1452
03:06:23,506 --> 03:06:26,216
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1453
03:06:26,509 --> 03:06:29,636
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1454
03:06:30,137 --> 03:06:33,473
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1455
03:06:33,683 --> 03:06:38,144
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1456
03:06:38,354 --> 03:06:43,108
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1457
03:06:43,693 --> 03:06:46,987
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1458
03:06:47,488 --> 03:06:49,865
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1459
03:06:51,367 --> 03:06:53,368
And l want an ordinary job, sir.

1460
03:06:53,619 --> 03:06:55,912
That's my reason for resigning.

1461
03:06:57,206 --> 03:06:58,874
It's personal.

1462
03:06:59,041 --> 03:07:01,251
-Personal?
-Yes, sir.

1463
03:07:01,544 --> 03:07:04,629
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1464
03:07:04,881 --> 03:07:08,216
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

1465
03:07:08,509 --> 03:07:11,720
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1466
03:07:11,929 --> 03:07:14,014
That's my reason too.

1467
03:07:14,181 --> 03:07:19,227
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 1 6th of next month...

1468
03:07:19,395 --> 03:07:21,396
...and you are part of it.

1469
03:07:21,898 --> 03:07:25,567
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1470
03:07:25,776 --> 03:07:29,696
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1471
03:07:30,406 --> 03:07:32,449
What about your Arab friends?

1472
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:36,536
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1473
03:07:36,746 --> 03:07:38,914
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1474
03:07:39,165 --> 03:07:44,252
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1475
03:07:44,545 --> 03:07:47,422
-Lawrence.
-Yes?

1476
03:07:50,176 --> 03:07:52,928
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1477
03:07:53,179 --> 03:07:55,263
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1478
03:07:55,556 --> 03:07:57,265
Thank you, sir.

1479
03:07:58,309 --> 03:08:00,560
Why don't we...?

1480
03:08:03,105 --> 03:08:04,940
There's blood on your back.

1481
03:08:06,233 --> 03:08:09,319
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

1482
03:08:10,488 --> 03:08:12,697
Tell me what happened.

1483
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:19,788
Say, what goes on in there?

1484
03:08:20,581 --> 03:08:22,457
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

1485
03:08:22,708 --> 03:08:26,127
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-Is the man in trouble?

1486
03:08:26,337 --> 03:08:30,298
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1487
03:08:30,591 --> 03:08:34,469
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1488
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:38,139
-What claim?
-I've made that boy a hero.

1489
03:08:38,349 --> 03:08:41,101
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1490
03:08:41,310 --> 03:08:45,647
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1491
03:08:46,148 --> 03:08:48,984
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1492
03:08:49,527 --> 03:08:51,987
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1493
03:08:52,279 --> 03:08:55,031
Always walking away, aren't you?

1494
03:08:55,324 --> 03:08:56,825
Well, I'll tell you.

1495
03:08:57,034 --> 03:08:59,995
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1496
03:09:00,246 --> 03:09:03,164
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1497
03:09:03,374 --> 03:09:06,167
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1498
03:09:07,003 --> 03:09:10,005
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1499
03:09:10,506 --> 03:09:14,175
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1500
03:09:15,052 --> 03:09:17,971
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1501
03:09:18,556 --> 03:09:20,056
Leave me alone.

1502
03:09:20,349 --> 03:09:22,851
-Leave me alone.
-That's a feeble thing to say.

1503
03:09:23,060 --> 03:09:25,687
-I know I'm not ordinary.
-That's not what I'm saying.

1504
03:09:25,896 --> 03:09:28,690
All right, l'm extraordinary.

1505
03:09:30,693 --> 03:09:31,776
What of it?

1506
03:09:32,153 --> 03:09:34,863
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1507
03:09:35,031 --> 03:09:38,199
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1508
03:09:38,367 --> 03:09:40,535
Are you speaking from experience?

1509
03:09:40,828 --> 03:09:42,203
No.

1510
03:09:42,371 --> 03:09:44,205
You're guessing, then.

1511
03:09:45,374 --> 03:09:46,708
Suppose you're wrong.

1512
03:09:47,001 --> 03:09:50,045
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1513
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:53,840
-Yes. I said, yes.
-After all--

1514
03:09:56,385 --> 03:09:58,428
-The 1 6th?
-Can you do it?

1515
03:09:58,596 --> 03:10:00,722
I'll give you a lot of money.

1516
03:10:01,015 --> 03:10:03,850
-Artillery?
-I can't.

1517
03:10:05,061 --> 03:10:08,021
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1518
03:10:08,314 --> 03:10:10,523
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1519
03:10:11,567 --> 03:10:13,610
Which I'm going to give them.

1520
03:10:14,361 --> 03:10:16,112
That's all I want.

1521
03:10:17,198 --> 03:10:20,075
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1522
03:10:20,326 --> 03:10:24,579
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1523
03:10:24,872 --> 03:10:28,041
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1524
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:30,627
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1525
03:10:30,878 --> 03:10:32,212
Fair enough.

1526
03:10:32,713 --> 03:10:35,590
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1527
03:10:36,342 --> 03:10:38,259
It's going to happen.

1528
03:10:38,928 --> 03:10:41,054
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1529
03:10:41,764 --> 03:10:43,431
All there is.

1530
03:10:43,933 --> 03:10:45,558
Not that much.

1531
03:10:48,854 --> 03:10:51,606
The best of them
won't come for money.

1532
03:10:53,484 --> 03:10:54,901
They'll come for me.

1533
03:11:13,379 --> 03:11:14,629
No pictures!

1534
03:11:14,922 --> 03:11:17,257
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1535
03:11:17,466 --> 03:11:21,636
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1536
03:11:21,887 --> 03:11:24,139
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1537
03:11:28,602 --> 03:11:31,187
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

1538
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:32,772
Yes.

1539
03:11:32,940 --> 03:11:35,316
-Changed, hasn't he?
-No.

1540
03:11:35,484 --> 03:11:38,403
Oh, l'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1541
03:11:43,159 --> 03:11:46,828
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1542
03:11:47,538 --> 03:11:52,333
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1543
03:11:54,003 --> 03:11:56,546
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1544
03:11:56,839 --> 03:11:58,506
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1545
03:11:58,716 --> 03:12:00,675
-I did.
-What did he say?

1546
03:12:00,926 --> 03:12:02,510
He laughed.

1547
03:12:03,012 --> 03:12:05,638
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1548
03:12:06,182 --> 03:12:07,724
He offered me money.

1549
03:12:08,017 --> 03:12:09,559
Did you take it?

1550
03:12:10,352 --> 03:12:12,979
No. But many did.

1551
03:12:50,726 --> 03:12:53,770
-What is this?
-This is my bodyguard.

1552
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:57,106
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1553
03:12:57,399 --> 03:13:01,027
-There's a price on my head too.
-But these are murderers.

1554
03:13:01,237 --> 03:13:03,238
The sheiks will hang these men.

1555
03:13:03,489 --> 03:13:05,240
These men are mine.

1556
03:13:05,741 --> 03:13:10,078
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1557
03:13:10,412 --> 03:13:13,873
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
-Sherif?

1558
03:13:14,083 --> 03:13:17,085
-Where do we ride?
-Damascus, sherif.

1559
03:13:17,294 --> 03:13:19,212
Aye, but for what?

1560
03:13:19,421 --> 03:13:21,589
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1561
03:13:24,718 --> 03:13:28,054
-You have bought these things.
-I bought half the men here, Ali.

1562
03:13:28,264 --> 03:13:31,057
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1563
03:13:31,267 --> 03:13:34,269
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1564
03:13:38,274 --> 03:13:40,108
Damascus!

1565
03:13:40,317 --> 03:13:45,738
Damascus! Damascus!

1566
03:14:19,606 --> 03:14:23,151
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1567
03:14:23,444 --> 03:14:27,071
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1568
03:14:27,281 --> 03:14:30,950
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1569
03:14:31,118 --> 03:14:32,160
Certainly.

1570
03:14:32,328 --> 03:14:34,078
He can't be far from Mallud...

1571
03:14:34,705 --> 03:14:39,000
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1572
03:14:39,293 --> 03:14:41,294
Splendid. Philip.

1573
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:44,339
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1574
03:14:44,631 --> 03:14:48,176
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1575
03:14:48,844 --> 03:14:52,305
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1576
03:14:52,473 --> 03:14:53,723
Any questions?

1577
03:14:54,183 --> 03:14:58,311
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1578
03:14:58,812 --> 03:15:01,022
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1579
03:15:01,190 --> 03:15:03,107
Where are they now?

1580
03:15:03,817 --> 03:15:08,696
-Can only know by being with them.
-Then get with them. I want to know.

1581
03:15:09,031 --> 03:15:11,324
Pound them, Charley.

1582
03:15:11,909 --> 03:15:13,326
Pound them.

1583
03:15:23,879 --> 03:15:26,714
God help the men who lie under that.

1584
03:15:26,924 --> 03:15:28,549
They're Turks.

1585
03:15:28,759 --> 03:15:30,426
God help them.

1586
03:16:13,178 --> 03:16:16,931
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1587
03:16:17,182 --> 03:16:18,474
Cocky?

1588
03:16:18,684 --> 03:16:20,435
More than cocky, sir.

1589
03:16:20,727 --> 03:16:24,063
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1590
03:16:24,273 --> 03:16:27,775
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1591
03:16:28,444 --> 03:16:30,278
-Unless....
-Unless?

1592
03:16:30,446 --> 03:16:34,323
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1593
03:16:34,616 --> 03:16:37,577
-What do the Turks have in Mazril?
-A brigade, sir.

1594
03:16:40,581 --> 03:16:42,790
I wonder where they are now.

1595
03:18:24,851 --> 03:18:26,018
No prisoners.

1596
03:18:29,523 --> 03:18:31,607
Damascus, Lawrence.

1597
03:18:41,535 --> 03:18:44,370
Lawrence, not this.

1598
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:49,083
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1599
03:18:49,835 --> 03:18:51,419
No prisoners.

1600
03:19:01,555 --> 03:19:03,139
This was Talaal's village.

1601
03:19:07,394 --> 03:19:08,994
Talaal!

1602
03:19:29,666 --> 03:19:33,252
No prisoners!

1603
03:19:45,140 --> 03:19:46,740
God.

1604
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:54,815
God!

1605
03:22:12,120 --> 03:22:15,289
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1606
03:23:52,679 --> 03:23:53,888
Major!

1607
03:23:54,556 --> 03:23:56,223
Major Lawrence!

1608
03:24:01,897 --> 03:24:03,897
Jesus wept.

1609
03:24:22,250 --> 03:24:24,293
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1610
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:27,713
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1611
03:24:27,923 --> 03:24:29,757
Barbarous and cruel.

1612
03:24:30,592 --> 03:24:34,219
Who but they?

1613
03:24:36,556 --> 03:24:38,933
Oh, you rotten man.

1614
03:24:39,976 --> 03:24:44,396
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1615
03:24:46,483 --> 03:24:48,609
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1616
03:25:15,095 --> 03:25:18,597
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1617
03:25:19,015 --> 03:25:20,724
Damascus!

1618
03:25:20,934 --> 03:25:22,810
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1619
03:25:23,019 --> 03:25:24,436
Tell him.

1620
03:25:25,438 --> 03:25:27,147
Remind him.

1621
03:25:27,983 --> 03:25:31,110
-Is Allenby in Damascus?
-Near.

1622
03:25:31,945 --> 03:25:34,238
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1623
03:25:35,490 --> 03:25:37,324
They are not ripe.

1624
03:25:43,289 --> 03:25:45,332
General salute!

1625
03:25:45,500 --> 03:25:50,212
Present arms!

1626
03:26:02,142 --> 03:26:04,018
Port arms!

1627
03:26:06,813 --> 03:26:08,689
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1628
03:26:08,898 --> 03:26:11,775
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1629
03:26:18,074 --> 03:26:19,867
-When?
-A day and a night, sir.

1630
03:26:20,076 --> 03:26:21,994
They've been here a day and a night.

1631
03:26:22,203 --> 03:26:24,705
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1632
03:26:24,998 --> 03:26:28,876
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1633
03:26:29,794 --> 03:26:31,587
What else beside the town hall?

1634
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:34,715
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1635
03:26:35,008 --> 03:26:37,384
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1636
03:26:37,594 --> 03:26:40,554
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1637
03:26:40,722 --> 03:26:42,389
...and they're in the town hall.

1638
03:26:42,682 --> 03:26:45,559
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1639
03:26:47,228 --> 03:26:48,729
What should we do about it?

1640
03:26:48,938 --> 03:26:51,356
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1641
03:26:52,233 --> 03:26:54,068
How about that, Dryden?

1642
03:26:55,862 --> 03:26:58,572
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1643
03:26:59,365 --> 03:27:02,409
-What, then?
-When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1644
03:27:02,577 --> 03:27:04,620
By special train in two days' time.

1645
03:27:04,913 --> 03:27:06,205
Two days.

1646
03:27:06,372 --> 03:27:09,750
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1647
03:27:10,043 --> 03:27:12,086
-Isn't it enough?
-Yes.

1648
03:27:12,253 --> 03:27:15,714
-Ample, l should think.
-We can't just do nothing.

1649
03:27:15,924 --> 03:27:19,593
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1650
03:27:19,844 --> 03:27:24,098
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1651
03:27:24,474 --> 03:27:26,100
Does that apply to technical units?

1652
03:27:26,392 --> 03:27:28,477
Technical units particularly.

1653
03:27:28,770 --> 03:27:30,104
Yes, sir.

1654
03:27:30,647 --> 03:27:32,106
Medicals too, sir?

1655
03:27:32,357 --> 03:27:34,566
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1656
03:27:34,901 --> 03:27:36,610
Medicals too.

1657
03:28:16,985 --> 03:28:18,527
We here...

1658
03:28:18,778 --> 03:28:21,655
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1659
03:28:21,823 --> 03:28:24,992
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1660
03:28:25,326 --> 03:28:28,787
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1661
03:28:28,997 --> 03:28:31,039
He insulted me.

1662
03:28:32,167 --> 03:28:36,295
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1663
03:28:36,504 --> 03:28:39,339
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1664
03:28:39,841 --> 03:28:43,552
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1665
03:28:43,803 --> 03:28:47,347
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1666
03:28:49,809 --> 03:28:52,144
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1667
03:28:53,021 --> 03:28:56,523
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1668
03:28:59,235 --> 03:29:03,197
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1669
03:29:03,448 --> 03:29:04,990
Humbly?

1670
03:29:05,158 --> 03:29:06,533
Humbly, Harith?

1671
03:29:06,826 --> 03:29:08,827
Yes, humbly.

1672
03:29:09,204 --> 03:29:11,330
This is a new trick.

1673
03:29:12,332 --> 03:29:13,999
Why is there no electricity?

1674
03:29:14,959 --> 03:29:17,711
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1675
03:29:17,962 --> 03:29:20,839
There are three large machines.

1676
03:29:21,049 --> 03:29:23,383
He means generators!

1677
03:29:23,885 --> 03:29:25,052
So.

1678
03:29:25,511 --> 03:29:27,221
One of them is burning.

1679
03:29:27,472 --> 03:29:30,557
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1680
03:29:30,892 --> 03:29:33,602
It is so of all machines.

1681
03:29:33,853 --> 03:29:37,856
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1682
03:29:40,526 --> 03:29:43,695
-The need is absolute.
-Then we need English engineers.

1683
03:29:43,905 --> 03:29:47,574
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1684
03:29:47,867 --> 03:29:49,076
Take--

1685
03:29:53,206 --> 03:29:54,414
Fire has broken out.

1686
03:29:54,624 --> 03:29:56,208
-Where?
-The Jinsibi district.

1687
03:29:56,417 --> 03:29:59,294
-It is not a district that matters.
-It will spread!

1688
03:29:59,587 --> 03:30:01,255
Then use the fire brigade!

1689
03:30:01,547 --> 03:30:04,424
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1690
03:30:04,634 --> 03:30:06,134
Then you must carry it.

1691
03:30:06,427 --> 03:30:10,764
-The Ruala do not carry water.
-What else are they good for?

1692
03:30:23,069 --> 03:30:26,613
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1693
03:30:29,450 --> 03:30:31,159
This afternoon!

1694
03:30:54,934 --> 03:30:58,937
-I'll take this up after the war.
-Surely we should do something, sir.

1695
03:30:59,147 --> 03:31:03,108
-It's an old man's sport.
-Are you an old man, sir?

1696
03:31:03,318 --> 03:31:06,194
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1697
03:31:07,655 --> 03:31:08,989
Sorry, sir.

1698
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,868
Maybe it's the bulb.

1699
03:31:17,582 --> 03:31:18,707
No, sir.

1700
03:31:19,167 --> 03:31:20,834
It's the power.

1701
03:31:36,017 --> 03:31:37,392
They're leaving.

1702
03:31:38,102 --> 03:31:39,811
That's it, then.

1703
03:31:40,313 --> 03:31:42,397
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1704
03:32:03,628 --> 03:32:06,505
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1705
03:32:06,756 --> 03:32:08,757
-Come where?
-Back.

1706
03:32:13,221 --> 03:32:15,430
I know your heart.

1707
03:32:23,898 --> 03:32:25,524
What is it?

1708
03:32:26,526 --> 03:32:28,193
Is it this?

1709
03:32:30,905 --> 03:32:34,032
I tell you, this is nothing.

1710
03:32:47,213 --> 03:32:48,880
Is it the blood?

1711
03:32:49,674 --> 03:32:52,759
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1712
03:32:54,303 --> 03:32:58,682
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1713
03:32:59,767 --> 03:33:01,059
Hear me, God.

1714
03:33:02,770 --> 03:33:06,606
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1715
03:33:23,458 --> 03:33:24,749
What about you?

1716
03:33:25,751 --> 03:33:29,337
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1717
03:33:31,841 --> 03:33:33,258
A very low occupation.

1718
03:33:33,759 --> 03:33:36,803
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1719
03:33:45,771 --> 03:33:48,648
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1720
03:33:48,858 --> 03:33:50,775
It's what I came for.

1721
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:55,530
And then...

1722
03:33:57,950 --> 03:33:59,326
...it would be something.

1723
03:33:59,535 --> 03:34:00,785
Yes.

1724
03:34:01,454 --> 03:34:02,662
Much.

1725
03:34:21,682 --> 03:34:24,142
-He is your friend?
-Take your hand away.

1726
03:34:24,352 --> 03:34:25,644
-You love him.
-I fear him.

1727
03:34:25,853 --> 03:34:27,687
Then why do you weep?

1728
03:34:28,022 --> 03:34:30,190
If I fear him, who love him...

1729
03:34:30,358 --> 03:34:33,318
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1730
03:34:33,694 --> 03:34:36,821
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1731
03:34:39,200 --> 03:34:42,536
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1732
03:34:42,703 --> 03:34:43,787
Not yet.

1733
03:34:44,038 --> 03:34:48,375
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1734
03:34:48,918 --> 03:34:50,835
And Allah be thanked.

1735
03:34:51,337 --> 03:34:52,712
I'll tell thee what...

1736
03:34:53,005 --> 03:34:56,341
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1737
03:35:17,822 --> 03:35:21,116
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1738
03:35:21,409 --> 03:35:24,244
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1739
03:35:24,453 --> 03:35:28,832
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1740
03:35:29,083 --> 03:35:32,085
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1741
03:35:32,378 --> 03:35:33,920
No, sir, I will not.

1742
03:35:34,880 --> 03:35:36,464
Control yourself.

1743
03:35:36,966 --> 03:35:40,093
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1744
03:35:41,053 --> 03:35:43,346
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1745
03:35:43,556 --> 03:35:46,391
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1746
03:35:46,767 --> 03:35:51,229
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1747
03:35:51,897 --> 03:35:56,484
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1748
03:36:03,242 --> 03:36:04,659
What's it like?

1749
03:37:21,529 --> 03:37:23,571
This is outrageous!

1750
03:37:24,699 --> 03:37:26,699
Outrageous!

1751
03:37:32,665 --> 03:37:34,874
You filthy little wog!

1752
03:37:45,386 --> 03:37:49,472
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1753
03:37:49,724 --> 03:37:52,183
"My friend Lawrence."

1754
03:37:52,393 --> 03:37:57,021
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1755
03:37:57,231 --> 03:37:59,899
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1756
03:38:00,109 --> 03:38:05,238
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1757
03:38:05,489 --> 03:38:09,075
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1758
03:38:09,368 --> 03:38:12,871
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1759
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:16,583
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1760
03:38:17,501 --> 03:38:19,711
You're promoted colonel.

1761
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:22,380
Yes. What for?

1762
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:25,759
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1763
03:38:26,010 --> 03:38:30,096
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1764
03:38:30,723 --> 03:38:33,016
Then, thank you.

1765
03:38:37,229 --> 03:38:38,438
Well, then...

1766
03:38:39,064 --> 03:38:40,106
...Godspeed.

1767
03:38:40,608 --> 03:38:44,527
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1768
03:38:44,779 --> 03:38:48,907
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1769
03:38:49,116 --> 03:38:51,451
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1770
03:38:51,619 --> 03:38:53,536
...are the virtues of young men.

1771
03:38:53,788 --> 03:38:57,248
Courage and hope for the future.

1772
03:38:57,458 --> 03:39:00,126
Then old men make the peace.

1773
03:39:01,253 --> 03:39:04,130
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1774
03:39:04,340 --> 03:39:06,800
Mistrust and caution.

1775
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:09,594
It must be so.

1776
03:39:25,986 --> 03:39:30,615
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1777
03:39:40,334 --> 03:39:44,003
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1778
03:39:44,296 --> 03:39:46,005
The pumping plant I must retain.

1779
03:39:46,215 --> 03:39:48,800
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1780
03:39:49,009 --> 03:39:52,720
-I shall be glad of assistance.
-Then you must bring down your flag.

1781
03:39:53,013 --> 03:39:56,850
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1782
03:39:57,142 --> 03:39:58,810
-Have you men?
-Enough for that.

1783
03:39:59,019 --> 03:40:01,396
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1784
03:40:01,730 --> 03:40:03,606
I'm sure your government...

1785
03:40:03,858 --> 03:40:07,694
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1786
03:40:09,989 --> 03:40:11,489
I say!

1787
03:40:12,867 --> 03:40:14,826
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1788
03:40:17,162 --> 03:40:19,372
May I shake your hand, sir?

1789
03:40:20,541 --> 03:40:23,167
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1790
03:40:26,755 --> 03:40:29,007
Haven't we met before?

1791
03:40:29,216 --> 03:40:30,842
Don't think so, sir.

1792
03:40:31,051 --> 03:40:33,761
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1793
03:40:39,018 --> 03:40:43,187
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1794
03:40:43,397 --> 03:40:45,398
They have no power. lt's illusory.

1795
03:40:45,649 --> 03:40:48,067
Illusions can be very powerful.

1796
03:40:48,444 --> 03:40:50,069
Particularly...

1797
03:40:50,946 --> 03:40:53,573
...when they take this form.

1798
03:40:55,743 --> 03:40:58,745
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1799
03:40:58,954 --> 03:41:00,914
...liberated by the Arab army.

1800
03:41:01,457 --> 03:41:04,542
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1801
03:41:05,085 --> 03:41:10,089
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1802
03:41:10,382 --> 03:41:13,426
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1803
03:41:17,056 --> 03:41:19,265
I thought l was a hard man, sir.

1804
03:41:20,100 --> 03:41:22,393
You are merely a general.

1805
03:41:24,939 --> 03:41:26,439
I must be a king.

1806
03:41:29,443 --> 03:41:31,319
Excuse me, sir.

1807
03:41:45,960 --> 03:41:47,251
Well?

1808
03:41:48,128 --> 03:41:49,504
Well...

1809
03:41:49,964 --> 03:41:52,840
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1810
03:41:53,092 --> 03:41:55,301
...with an Arab flag on it.

1811
03:41:55,511 --> 03:41:57,470
Do you think it was worth it?

1812
03:41:57,638 --> 03:42:00,306
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1813
03:42:00,641 --> 03:42:01,808
Yes, sir.

1814
03:42:02,101 --> 03:42:03,726
So you keep saying.

1815
03:42:03,936 --> 03:42:05,520
You, I suspect...

1816
03:42:06,021 --> 03:42:09,941
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1817
03:42:10,359 --> 03:42:13,486
-What do you think?
-Me, Your Highness?

1818
03:42:14,154 --> 03:42:18,449
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1819
03:42:56,488 --> 03:42:59,532
Well, sir. Going home.

1820
03:43:01,869 --> 03:43:03,536
Home, sir.

1821
03:43:27,736 --> 03:43:30,936
