1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,319
The French have said
au revoir to the franc.

2
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,419
The Germans have said
auf wiedersehen to the Deutschmark.

3
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,516
And the Portuguese have said
whatever to their thing.

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:29,621
Go!

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,732
Now it's our turn to say
goodbye to Sterling.

6
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,236
This Christmas
we are going to get the euro.

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,133
Goodbye old pound.

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,933
Everyone says
we are going to miss you.

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,837
- Come on!
- Faster! Faster!

10
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,637
- Hey come on!
- Faster!

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,014
I can't see ya!
Where are you?

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,015
I'm over here!

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,712
This is the main drag along here.

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,822
That's Portland.

15
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:01,620
Bisecting that at right angles,
is Lundy on that side.

16
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,629
On this side there's Fastnet.
What's yours?

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,027
Cromarty.

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,226
Cromarty and German Bight.

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,837
Cul de sacs. Over here.

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,138
- I've come through.
- Come on! Come on, Damian!

21
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,642
There's a train coming!

22
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,116
Keep pedalling. Come on!

23
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,820
Faster!

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,617
- Beat ya!
- Come on!

25
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,026
I'm gonna call it Serendipity.

26
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,533
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,332
- Anyway it's number twenty.
- Upstairs!

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,537
- This is my room.
- And mine.

29
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,340
Get your own room.

30
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,536
The patron saint of
house removals is Saint Anne.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,138
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that, no.

32
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,833
Yeah, she lived in
the desert, obviously.

33
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,533
And when she wanted to move house.

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,441
Angels came, picked up her house
and took it to Italy.

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,842
Handy.

36
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,814
She was Our Lady's mother.

37
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,118
What you on about Damian?

38
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,726
Saint Anne. I've got a picture.

39
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,523
Look. I don't care, just get
in the car, will ya? We're going'.

40
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,723
Go on! Get in the car!

41
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,037
- Was she in it at the time?
- Who?

42
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,833
Saint Anne.
When the angels did the...

43
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,033
you know the airlift?

44
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,541
I don't know.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,310
Start with the money.

46
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,418
That's what our Anthony says.

47
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,816
That's what people
want to know about.

48
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,615
Like if you're moving house...

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,317
you don't say 'we're moving house
and the new one has got a green door.'

50
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,121
You say how much you're paying.

51
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,526
How much you got for the old one.

52
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,727
Mortgage. Interest rates.
Stamp duty. Solicitor's fees.

53
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,736
How much you'll get
if the new one goes up in value.

54
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,237
That's called equity.

55
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,239
Personally, I think, 'so what? '

56
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,741
Money's just a thing.

57
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,139
And things change.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,248
One minute something's there
and you can cuddle up to it.

59
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,111
The next minute it's gone.

60
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,013
Like a Malteser.

61
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,517
That goes in the kitchen.

62
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,815
Is this fantastic or what?

63
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,720
Surprisingly spacious,
with attractive views.

64
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,121
Oh, that's Anthony's.
That must go upstairs and...

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,023
And anyway, in the end,

66
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,325
it turns out it wasn't about
the money after all.

67
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,632
That's it lads.
Up to the main bedroom.

68
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,737
Has anyone seen
where the phone points are?

69
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,738
Eh, where do I plug this in?

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,844
Oh, right, yeah.
Oh that looks good, that does.

71
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,418
Right

72
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,862
this is what
we're having' tonight, yeah?

73
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,727
Before Countdown,
put the oven on.

74
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,925
After Countdown,
get a packet of these,

75
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,228
put them in there
with some oven chips, yeah?

76
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,132
It's for mum.

77
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,033
The time is on here, yeah.

78
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,773
Ok.

79
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,035
That's how long
they have to stay in.

80
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,642
By the time they're ready,
I'll be back.

81
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,042
She may already have
won ten thousand pounds.

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,307
Her name has been entered in a draw.

83
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,508
- All she has to do is...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,119
Thank you.

85
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,311
Hands?

86
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,215
Other sides.

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,522
Let's go.

88
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,719
Come on!

89
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,022
That's you.

90
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,927
Get your bags.

91
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,331
And your book bag, Damian.
Keyssss...

92
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,245
Now remember
it's no good being clever,

93
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,641
you've got to be
the cleverest, yeah?

94
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,339
- Alright. See ya Dad.
- Good luck lads.

95
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,313
See ya.
Are you nervous?

96
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,418
A bit.

97
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,521
So everybody sitting up nicely?
Excellent.

98
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,925
Now we are talking, today,
about people we admire.

99
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,623
- Dminic?
- Roy Keane, Sir, Manchester United.

100
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,131
Very good, Roy Keane.

101
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:15,927
What about you Barry?

102
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,127
- Van Nistelrooy, sir.
- Van Nistelrooy, right.

103
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,035
Anyone got any heroes
who don't play for United?

104
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,335
- Jack?
- Robbie Fowler, Sir, City.

105
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,435
Alright, that's enough.

106
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,546
Tricia?

107
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,910
I don't know any footballers, sir.

108
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,311
Well, it doesn't have
to be a footballer,

109
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,316
it could be... anyone.

110
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,013
- Don't know sir.
- No?

111
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,417
Damian?

112
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,819
Saint Roch, sir.

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,426
- Who's he play for?
- No one sir, he's a Saint.

114
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,324
Oh that's better, go on.

115
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,831
He was so worried that
he might say something bad.

116
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,526
That he said nothing
at all for twenty years.

117
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,035
We could do with a couple
like him in this class.

118
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,933
Thank you, Damian.

119
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,438
I like a lot of virgin martyrs too.

120
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,042
Like Saint Agatha.

121
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,438
She ripped her own eyes out,

122
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,842
so she wouldn't have
to marry this man.

123
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,208
Or Saint Katherine of Alexandria.

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,319
They tried to kill her by crushing
her to death on a wheel.

125
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,318
But she made the wheel explode

126
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,515
and all the splinters
killed people in the crowd.

127
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,124
The patron Saint of fireworks.

128
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,024
That's where we get
the Catherine wheel from.

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,222
I did say thank you, Damian.

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,225
Right, I brought in this picture.

131
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,826
This is a hero of mine.
Who knows who this is?

132
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,635
- Nelson Mandela?
- Fantastic, Nelson Mandela.

133
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,722
I should be careful
what you talk about.

134
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,122
Try talking about football
or something.

135
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,920
Keep off the weird stuff.

136
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,032
Just don't be conspicuous
or you won't fit in.

137
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:27,228
Aero and a Yorkie please.
And five juicy lips.

138
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,934
Haven't seen you two here, before.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,731
We just moved here.

140
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,339
Our mam's dead.

141
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,844
Yeah, well go on, you're alright.

142
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,036
- Thanks.
- God bless.

143
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,941
Who's next?

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,739
Works every time.

145
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,112
You tell them your mam's dead
and they give you stuff, every time.

146
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,824
I'm your... Community Policeman.

147
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,827
Obviously there is
no community here as yet,

148
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,835
not to speak of, but you know...

149
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,340
Anyway the first thing to say is,

150
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,841
these new houses
and Christmas coming up.

151
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,947
Statistically
you're going to get burgled.

152
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,608
Now, not all of you, but some of you, soon.

153
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,720
Probably this week, next.

154
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,314
When you are, call me.

155
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,127
I'll give you a crime number

156
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,130
and then you can make a claim
on your insurance.

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,937
Building maintenance?

158
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,530
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

159
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,437
Yeah, I'm usually right,
it's a knack.

160
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,942
Do you mind me asking?
Is the kettle actually on? I'm...

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,342
Oh, sorry.

162
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,612
Yes?

163
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,015
Isn't the problem here,
that our houses are built on sand?

164
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,916
Sand? No.

165
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,413
They're not are they?

166
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:01,117
If you store up your treasure
on earth it will be stolen.

167
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,627
But if you give it away,
then it can't be stolen.

168
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,823
Mormons?

169
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,434
Well, Latter Day Saints.

170
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,728
Saints?

171
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,734
I know all about them...

172
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,735
Errr... Damian,

173
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,635
go and give Terry a hand
in the kitchen will you?

174
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,038
You too Anthony,
off you go, good lads.

175
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,341
Now, some of you are
going to be burgled.

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,505
There are things I can tell you,

177
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,810
that will lower the odds
of it being you personally.

178
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,316
It's a bit anti-social,

179
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,613
because if it isn't
you then it'll be next door,

180
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,619
but ha-ha there you go.

181
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,923
Our mam's dead.

182
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,829
Here. Go on, help yourself.

183
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,528
Take as many as you like, son.

184
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,014
Result.

185
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,415
Is it completely honest?

186
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,228
Completely dead isn't she?

187
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,127
What?

188
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,234
What do you want?

189
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,338
Can't you see I'm busy?

190
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,739
Just go away.

191
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,327
I don't like having my own room.

192
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,636
Clare of Assisi,

193
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,543
Eleven Ninety Four till
Twelve Fifty Three?

194
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,614
That's right.

195
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,012
I used to have a hermitage,
myself, once.

196
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,028
I used to go and hide up there.

197
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,428
If anyone needed me,
I'd send them a vision, sort them out.

198
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,034
That's why I'm the patron
saint of television.

199
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,229
I was like... human television.

200
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,840
You're the patron saint
of television?

201
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,942
Keeps me busy.

202
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,043
You know?

203
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,247
Are you allowed to smoke then?

204
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,408
You can do what you
like up there, son.

205
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,619
It's down here,
you have to make the effort.

206
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,616
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

207
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,522
She hasn't been there long.

208
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,323
Don't ring a bell.

209
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,128
Then again,
it is infinite up there.

210
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,231
Absolutely bloody infinite.

211
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,035
Listen...

212
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,818
Dad.

213
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,011
What is it anyway?

214
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,622
What are you doing
with all these boxes?

215
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,127
- What's that?
- Wait and see.

216
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,737
Where did you get that?

217
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,932
You can see it too then?

218
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,043
Well... you know...

219
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,737
sometimes you see things.
Don't you?

220
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,040
And other people can't see them.

221
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,512
What?

222
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,314
Well... you know... sometimes,
but this is real though.

223
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,115
This is real. This is real

224
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,626
Can't wait to tell dad.

225
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,729
You can't tell dad about this.

226
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,626
You can't tell anyone about this.

227
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,925
Why not?

228
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,226
Tax.

229
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,236
If the government
find out about this,

230
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,635
they'll take forty percent
of it away.

231
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,138
Forty percent!

232
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,935
Do you know how much that is?

233
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,042
Nearly all of it.

234
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,317
Shall we count it before we go?

235
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,425
No, we can't we're really late.

236
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,026
How much? How much?

237
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,225
There's thousands.

238
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,027
Ten thousand.

239
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,932
- Fifty thousand.
- Seventy.

240
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,129
Two hundred thousand.

241
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,933
Millions even.

242
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,538
Patch... Jenga.

243
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,947
Oink. Oink. Oink. Oink.

244
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,818
Promise not to tell anyone.

245
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,112
What is it?

246
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,922
- How much is it?
- Thousands.

247
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,422
Hundreds.

248
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,116
It's just hundreds.

249
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,318
No one else knows.

250
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,521
So if anyone finds out,
we'll know it's you. Ok?

251
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,528
Anyone finds out we know it's you.

252
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,332
No one else knows.

253
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,134
Just me and you. Here.

254
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,935
Thanks.

255
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
Yeah, just keep it shut.

256
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,817
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,

257
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,518
five hundred and
twenty pounds, minus...

258
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,129
a hundred quid each,
spending money.

259
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,424
Leaves two hundred
and twenty nine thousand,

260
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,828
three hundred and twenty quid.

261
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,527
And we're going to give
all that to the poor.

262
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,729
Where you going to find poor people?

263
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,635
There's loads of poor people.

264
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,743
Not round here.
The house prices keep them out.

265
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,534
Go on. Go. Go.

266
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,618
Go on. Go. Go. Go on.
Go. Go. Go. Go on.

267
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,814
Go on.

268
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,026
Francis of Assisi?

269
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,431
Eleven eighty one till
twelve twenty six.

270
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,127
You did this didn't you?

271
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,136
My first act as a Saint.

272
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,105
What was your next one?

273
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,010
Washing a leper.

274
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,209
A leper?

275
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,320
You could just help
the poor Damian.

276
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,523
Big Issue. Help the homeless.

277
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,827
Big Issue anyone?

278
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,825
Oh hello.

279
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,228
And keep the change.

280
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,336
Oh, thanks mate,
I've had nothing to eat all day.

281
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,734
Oh we're going to Pizza Hut,
want to come.

282
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,331
No... no. She doesn't.
She just wants more money.

283
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,536
- We haven't got any more.
- No I fancy pizza actually.

284
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,238
Can I bring my friend?

285
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,222
Meat feast, deep and juicy,
stuffed crust mate.

286
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,725
Two meat feast thin and crispy.

287
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,022
- Ah a big New Yorker.
- A combo platter.

288
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,325
- Do us a farmhouse.
- I'll have some garlic bread love.

289
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,831
We'll all have some
garlic bread won't we?

290
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,630
And Dippin' Chicken.
To share.

291
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,439
This is great. Anthony thought
there were no poor people round here.

292
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,543
Because of the house prices.

293
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,144
Well they're not from round here.

294
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,440
- Come in on the bus.
- I come in on the train.

295
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,605
Couldn't afford to
live round here.

296
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,410
Who exactly is paying
for all this?

297
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,813
We are.

298
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,314
- You must be minted!
- Yeah we are.

299
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,117
No... no, we're not.

300
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,316
It's birthday money.

301
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,120
His birthday money,
he saved it.

302
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,029
- Puddings?
- Yes please.

303
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,425
No.

304
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,624
One hundred and sixty eight quid.

305
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,325
Do you know how many times
we'd have to visit Pizza Hut

306
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,629
to get rid of all the money?

307
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,739
One thousand, three hundred and
three point five one seven times.

308
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,340
It's just not practical.

309
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,033
We should buy property.

310
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,940
See this house,
we could buy two like that.

311
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,047
If they knocked some off
the asking price.

312
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,615
And if we did buy property,
that'll go up in value.

313
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,616
So we'd have even more money.

314
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,611
Damian?

315
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,830
Excuse me?

316
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,233
Are you poor?

317
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,231
Beg your pardon?

318
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,835
Are you poor?

319
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,437
Are you asking for money?

320
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,038
Me? No.

321
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,038
Because we don't have any.

322
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,440
We live in a community,
you know, it's very basic.

323
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,105
We don't have a dishwasher
for instance or a microwave.

324
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,308
And there's no cash kept
on the premises.

325
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,214
So you are poor?

326
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,412
In a sense, yes.

327
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,818
Brilliant!

328
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,733
Invergi. Invergi

329
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,940
St. Nicholas of Myra?

330
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,339
Sanctus quartus saeculus sum...

331
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,743
Patronus de nautae et,
vero, natalis.

332
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,411
It won't all fit.

333
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,919
El fini errant centi cetus poplas

334
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,430
Saint Nicholas?

335
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,033
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

336
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,227
- Ques?
- Saint Maureen. She's new.

337
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,633
Quat facki abat?

338
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:57,435
Skin care. She worked on
the make-up counter at Selfridges.

339
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,043
Sel-frid-ges?

340
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,842
To betal?

341
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,210
Est a quero publican rodeo.

342
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,116
It's less than a fortnight to E-day.

343
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,022
That's when
Britain completes transition

344
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,130
to the European Monitory Union.
The EMU.

345
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:25,635
Oh with twelve days left to E-day,
my true love said to me.

346
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:31,334
The transitional exchange rate
is fixed at sixty seven p.

347
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:36,045
Oh! Well all I can say is...
ding dong

348
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,206
After E-day your old money
will no longer be legal tender.

349
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,912
Wish pounds goodbye and euros...

350
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,715
Hello.

351
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,220
We don't have to queue up.

352
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,818
Here we go.

353
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,321
How much have you actually got?

354
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,522
Plenty.

355
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,842
- Anthony Cunningham.
- Where's your dad?

356
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,841
My dad? Well he's not coming.

357
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,945
Eh?

358
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah, he's not coming yet.
He said to start without him.

359
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,814
Start what without him?

360
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,416
The job is to show him
around the apartment.

361
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,712
How can I do that,
if he isn't here?

362
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,115
He gave me this.

363
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,419
Show me around and
I'll fill him in afterwards.

364
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,423
It's what we usually do.

365
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,122
We're looking at this for our
investment portfolio.

366
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,733
Not as a residence.

367
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,232
Has it kept it's value?

368
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,428
It's gone up twenty percent
in the last two years,

369
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,038
because of the schools.

370
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,833
He does send you to school doesn't he?

371
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,135
Or do you just
look at photos of them?

372
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,811
Flood lights. Scoreboards. Stadium.

373
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:55,113
It's the dogs bollocks this,
family heirloom. Fifty quid?

374
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,311
Fifty quid?

375
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,422
You could buy
a proper football team for that.

376
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,525
I could buy Crewe Alexander for that.

377
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,220
Yeah but...
this has got managers.

378
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,421
Dan Leavy and Malcolm Allinson

379
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,123
Never heard of him.

380
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,324
Deal.

381
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,534
You said you would for five quid.

382
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,732
I didn't know you were going
to get five quid did I?

383
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,433
Ten quid then?

384
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,636
Look, I've got a good body.

385
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,311
Twenty quid, last offer.

386
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,532
Martyrs of Uganda,
eighteen eighty one?

387
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,933
That's right.

388
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,835
Ohhhh sorry about that.

389
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,644
I was beheaded. See.

390
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,107
Before that I was in construction.

391
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,916
I don't know who built this,
but they were a right cowboy.

392
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,919
I built it myself.

393
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,820
Well, you'll see what we can do.

394
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,517
But I can't promise anything.

395
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,526
Why not?
There's plenty of you.

396
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,121
Yes, come on welcome.

397
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,533
Hello.

398
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,515
What are they singing?

399
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,420
They are praying for rain.

400
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,421
Where I come from...

401
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,322
people have to pay a tenth
of their daily income on water.

402
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,229
It's so expensive that they can't
afford to wash their hands.

403
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,231
So they get disease.

404
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,936
You don't need fancy hospitals
or medicines to make life better,

405
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,637
just a well.
And you...

406
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,307
can build a well for as
little as one hundred pounds.

407
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,317
That's fantastic!
Thanks.

408
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,932
I'm sorry I don't know who you are.

409
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,929
Mutual that then.

410
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,435
This yours?

411
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,736
Nice.

412
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,809
Near a railway.

413
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,123
- What's in there?
- Nothing really.

414
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,738
- What's this?
- A dress. It was my mums.

415
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,312
What are you looking for?

416
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,020
Money.

417
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,729
Are you poor?

418
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,622
What?

419
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,233
Damian, come in.

420
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,629
Anthony to Damian...

421
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,369
What's that?

422
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,132
- Damian, where are you?
- My brother I've got to go.

423
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,035
I'll come back. I've got loads.
Just wait there.

424
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,737
- Loads of what?
- Money. Just wait there.

425
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,609
Five... four...
three... two...

426
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,208
Who's that?

427
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,819
A poor person and
you said there weren't any.

428
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,716
I know. But who is it?

429
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,323
I don't know. Just someone.

430
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,323
What do you mean 'someone'?

431
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,121
Did he do anything to you?

432
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,931
- What sort of things?
- Never mind.

433
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,626
Look people are weird.
You've got to be more careful.

434
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,430
You shouldn't really talk to them.

435
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,936
Anyway I've told him now.

436
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,235
- Told him what?
- That we have tons of money.

437
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,038
He's poor.

438
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,437
What?

439
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,918
Nothing. Nothing.
Leave it to me.

440
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,723
Where is he then?

441
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,526
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago.

442
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,639
See.

443
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:54,009
Loads of money.
We've been saving it up for ages.

444
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,318
You can have it if you need it.

445
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,915
Come on Damian.

446
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,121
You'll have to change it quickly.

447
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,436
Do you think that was really enough?

448
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,836
More than enough.

449
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,735
That's him completely sorted out.

450
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,305
Right. Have you given money
to anyone else?

451
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,711
Not really.

452
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,531
What?

453
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,541
It wasn't that much.

454
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,307
Just like a bagful.

455
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,120
- What's that?
- Scuba scooter.

456
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,020
It goes at ten mile an hour
for up to five hours.

457
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,219
We could have one of them.
We could have one each.

458
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,421
We could have a whole fleet.

459
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,429
She's nice.

460
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,034
Huh! I've seen better.
Close the door.

461
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,847
Look you can see it protruding.

462
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,508
- What is it?
- It's a nipple.

463
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,015
What's it for?

464
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,713
Well it's for feeding babies.

465
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,118
Did mum have one?

466
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,123
Two. They've all got two.

467
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,023
And did she feed us with them?

468
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,323
Yeah, course she did. I remember.

469
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,024
You can't remember
when you were a baby.

470
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,728
I don't remember her doing it to me.
I remember her doing it to you.

471
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,433
Anthony?

472
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,145
What?

473
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,406
I thought you'd done the washing up?

474
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,708
I did it!

475
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,407
What do you call that glob?

476
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,338
Hello what's your name?

477
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,633
Keegan.

478
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,538
Alright, K, what's happened
to your finger?

479
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,538
That's quality.
Pure scary, pure scary.

480
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,511
Hey, give me your money.
Come on, empty your pockets.

481
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,814
Hey you! Excuse me, excuse me!

482
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,822
Give me all your money.
Come on, every copper.

483
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,722
Who feels sorry
for poor children?

484
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,730
Correct answer.

485
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,235
Everybody sitting up nicely?

486
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,529
Ok. So, as you know,

487
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,833
we're going to have
new money in the New Year.

488
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,639
Does anybody know how much
a euro is worth in pounds?

489
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,410
Yes.

490
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,517
- Sixty seven p.
- Spot on.

491
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,209
Here, there's
a little prize for you.

492
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,116
It's your own euro converter.

493
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,519
Now! Who else wants one?
Anybody?

494
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,023
- Me!
- Ohh. Everybody. Ok.

495
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,722
So, who can tell me how much
two pence is worth in euros?

496
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,929
Mmm. Well I'll tell you.

497
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,636
It's worth not very much.
Almost nothing.

498
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,139
To you.

499
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,040
But if we all put our
two pences together.

500
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,306
Then we'll have a lot
of two pences won't we?

501
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,813
Yes.

502
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,712
How many people are there here?

503
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,818
One... two... three... four...

504
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,619
Five... six... seven... eight...

505
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,523
Two hundred and fifty.

506
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,321
Sorry?

507
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,226
There's two hundred
and fifty in the school.

508
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,525
Oh clever clogs head master.

509
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,025
Ok two hundred and fifty.

510
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:09,731
So if you each gave me two pence,
then I'd have five pounds.

511
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,341
It's not that much here.

512
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,537
But in Ethiopia five pounds
could feed a family for a week.

513
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,411
And if you all gave me two two pences,
then we'd have a tenner.

514
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,415
And that's enough
to provide that village

515
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,316
with a source
of clean water forever.

516
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,515
It's no good to you.
So chuck it in the bin.

517
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,524
Excuse me.
Give me all your money!

518
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,323
Come on, every copper.

519
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,630
Get out of my way. Hey you!

520
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,836
Hey, give me your money!

521
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,030
Come on. Empty your pockets.

522
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,944
Hello, what's your name?

523
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,943
Damian.

524
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,911
Hi Damian. I'm the Bin.

525
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,208
Hello Bin.

526
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,012
Damian, you'll give me
some money won't you?

527
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,525
Yeah.

528
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,439
What did you do?

529
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,736
You did it again didn't you?

530
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:20,935
What?

531
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,545
I saw what you did.

532
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,510
How much?

533
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,014
Not much. She's nice.

534
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,208
I've been thinking.

535
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,818
Why don't we give the money to her?

536
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,215
So how did it go?

537
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,412
Well...

538
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,619
A thousand!

539
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,421
What did you bring
a thousand to school for?

540
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,927
Can't you see
that that's suspicious?

541
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:42,521
It's not suspicious.
It's unusual.

542
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,932
How can it be suspicious?
It's our money.

543
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,236
Right you lot outside...
come on.

544
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,840
Right, that's enough
messing around.

545
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:51,942
Do you know in Africa

546
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,045
you can build a well for
as little as a hundred pounds.

547
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,508
Just listen.

548
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,714
It was the most daring,
most brilliant,

549
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,418
cleverest and biggest robbery
on record, ever.

550
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,028
The train was here.

551
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,724
The train,
the one with the money,

552
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,027
Used notes.

553
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,832
Right the van comes up
onto the platform... here.

554
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,834
It's a railway van
so no one takes any notice.

555
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,835
Until...

556
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,016
They jump out of this van

557
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,920
and some of them got hold
of the driver.

558
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,924
Some of them start shifting the money.

559
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,926
By this time rapid response
has been mobilised.

560
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,835
Alright, let's go. Come on!

561
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,915
The van drives off with
a reckless disregard for life.

562
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,920
Rapid response goes after it.

563
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,117
There's... armed units.
Dog handlers. Helicopters.

564
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,921
Throw everything at them.

565
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,927
The train stays here.

566
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,424
An ambulance comes,
takes the driver to hospital.

567
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,932
Get another driver.

568
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,732
The CID count the bags.
There's only one missing.

569
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,341
Then rapid response corner the van.

570
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,309
Trapped.

571
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,215
The robbers dropped
the lot and they leg it!

572
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,614
They've got no chance, except...

573
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:50,818
Newcastle United versusArsenal
at Highbury.

574
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,624
One all. Disappointing result
for the gunners.

575
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,727
Please advise car,
I think we've lost them.

576
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,230
They don't catch the men.

577
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,636
But that's alright
because when they get back to the van...

578
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,843
there's the missing bag.

579
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,842
How do you...
how do you know all that?

580
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,606
His uncle works for the police.

581
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:11,908
The van has gone.

582
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,607
The train is in the station.

583
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,413
And the cops are
in the cop shop making tea.

584
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,215
Where are the robbers?

585
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,824
Where's the last place
you're going to look?

586
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,326
- Our house?
- Maybe.

587
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,422
So the train moves off
with a new driver and all the money.

588
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,727
On the train.

589
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,336
The money was on the train
and so was a robber?

590
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,029
Lateral thinking.

591
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,134
The money stays on the train,
but so does a robber.

592
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:03,731
He sits tight.

593
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,336
And every time the train
comes to a slow bend

594
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,438
he chucks a sack of money out.

595
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,439
They've got people waiting
all over the country.

596
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,941
Could be Stafford or Crewe.

597
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,546
Could be Preston or Wigan.

598
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,308
Runcorn, it could be.

599
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,414
Could be here.

600
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,309
Damian.

601
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,820
Damian. Calm down.
It'll be alright.

602
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,116
No one knows it was us.

603
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,624
I don't care. Leave me alone.
What you have to tell me for?

604
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,229
Because I wanted you to know
the truth.

605
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,126
We have to give it back.

606
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,631
No... no we can't do that.

607
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,030
They were going to burn it.

608
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,627
Now come on, it isn't the money's
fault it got stolen.

609
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,136
- I thought it was from God.
- What?

610
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,938
Well you know sometimes
you tell people about mam

611
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,206
and they give you money
or sweets.

612
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,815
Well I told God and...

613
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,510
well who else would have
that kind of money?

614
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,716
Well... in a funny...

615
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:35,121
God doesn't rob banks, alright.
God does not rob banks.

616
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,425
Office. Now.

617
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,126
Your father's on his way.

618
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,436
Come in.

619
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,212
The Mormons!

620
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,912
You stole money from mormons?

621
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,318
Would you like to tell
us why you did it Anthony?

622
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,632
Our mam's dead.

623
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:30,003
Hey. Hey. Hey Anthony come here.
Anthony, Damian, come here.

624
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,017
Ok. Team talk.

625
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,814
Your mother,

626
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,226
She would not want you,

627
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,921
to stand around crying
or to steal things.

628
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,530
She wants you to get on
with your lives

629
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,136
and do the best you can.

630
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,135
Make her proud, son, eh?

631
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:00,537
And not, you know... cry.

632
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,215
Ok. So let's stop crying eh?

633
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,319
And stealing things.
Let's stop that too.

634
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,613
Get in the car.

635
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,525
Don't ever do that to me again.

636
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,132
Look. I'm really sorry
it was me.

637
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,327
I didn't mean to cause
any trouble or anything.

638
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,633
No you did right.
They stole it, what could you do?

639
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,742
They did give it to a good cause.

640
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,935
I wouldn't have done
that at their age.

641
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,810
They must be...
you did a good job.

642
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,711
Thanks.

643
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,017
Are you from the social?

644
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,524
No. I'm just a visitor.

645
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,027
I go round the schools
collecting for this water thing.

646
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,427
And try and tell them about
the change over, you know.

647
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,329
Making sure that
the kids understand it.

648
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,129
Does anyone understand it?

649
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,737
Sometimes they are a bit confused,
until I talk to them.

650
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,032
And then...

651
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,141
They're really confused.

652
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,213
I'm sorry.
They're very sorry.

653
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,714
I've sent them to bed.

654
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,115
I want you to know that
it won't happen again.

655
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:18,714
Do you mind me asking
how you came to have

656
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,619
so much cash in the house?

657
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,523
It was a donation.
It was left here anonymously.

658
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,930
And you weren't suspicious
about that?

659
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,624
No, we pray a lot and

660
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,632
we thought it was
the answers to our prayers.

661
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,329
Only it has been mentioned
that you spent close

662
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,439
to five thousand pounds in Comet...

663
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,040
A few days ago.

664
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,510
Digital television.
Mircowave oven.

665
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,612
Dishwasher. Foot spa.

666
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,018
Did you actually pray for
all of these things?

667
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,021
We were praying for comfort
and encouragement.

668
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,029
I think we felt comforted
and encouraged.

669
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,632
By the foot spa?

670
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,834
And the dishwasher.

671
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,438
Samaritans. Oxfam.

672
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,335
Christian Aid.

673
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,003
For Christ's sake,
don't tick them little boxes.

674
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,510
The ones about putting you in touch
with like-minded organisations.

675
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,619
You'll be besieged man.
I'm telling you!

676
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,313
Saint Peter, died AD sixty four.

677
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,321
Alright, don't remind us.

678
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,517
The money... it's robbed.

679
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,922
I know.

680
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,430
Patron Saint of keys,
locks and general security, man.

681
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,929
Including up there.
I'm on the door.

682
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,334
Is it still alright,
if it's robbed?

683
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:47,037
Can you still do good with it
or should you give it back?

684
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,510
I thought it was a miracle,
but it is just robbed.

685
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,615
Damian. Listen.

686
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,914
One day I was
with you know who, Jesus.

687
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,024
And he went up into the mountains
and thousands of people followed him.

688
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,425
The police said five thousand,
five thousand.

689
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,724
Everybody knows this story.

690
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:09,833
Loaves and fishes.

691
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,334
See, I knew you'd say that.
That's what everybody says.

692
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,137
This yours?

693
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,744
It's the key to the old house.

694
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,215
Jointed pin tumbler
Engineering perfection.

695
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:31,711
Anyway, this kid comes up to us,
about your size,

696
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,119
His name was...
no I have forgotten.

697
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,021
I still see him sometimes.

698
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,424
Anyway he comes up
with these loaves and fishes.

699
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,030
Sardines.

700
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,726
And Jesus blesses them
and passes the plate round.

701
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,434
Now the first person
he passes it to, passes it on.

702
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,732
He doesn't take anything.

703
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,331
He just passes it on.
Do you know why?

704
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,705
Because he had a piece
of lamb hidden in his pocket.

705
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,712
And as he is passing the fish,
he sneaks a bit of meat out

706
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,716
and pretends he's taken
it off the plate.

707
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,616
Do you see what I'm saying?

708
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:08,623
And the next person
exactly the same story.

709
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,024
Every single bastard one
of them has their own food.

710
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,630
And every one of them
is keeping it quiet.

711
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,630
Looking after number one.

712
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,331
But as that plate went round
with the sardines on

713
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,430
They all got their own food
out and started to share.

714
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,739
And then that plate went
all the way round

715
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,846
And back to Jesus

716
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,211
and it'd still got the fish
and the loaves on it.

717
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,016
I think Jesus was a bit taken aback.

718
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,316
He says, 'what happened? '

719
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,815
And I just said 'miracle'.

720
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,826
And at first
I thought I'd fooled him.

721
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:51,628
But now I see it was a miracle,
one of his best.

722
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,530
But this little kid
had stood up and...

723
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,940
Everybody there just got bigger.

724
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,314
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

725
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,711
Not really.

726
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,820
I'm talking about you.

727
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,512
Now I'm really lost.

728
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,715
You're trying too hard.

729
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,817
That kid he wasn't planning
on doing a miracle.

730
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,624
He wasn't planning anything,
except lunch.

731
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,724
Something that looks like a miracle
turns out to be dead simple.

732
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,134
But what am I going to do
with all this?

733
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,039
I just want to be good.

734
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,903
Look I can't say too
much about this,

735
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,311
because of that whole
free will thing.

736
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,609
Right?

737
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,311
But...

738
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,920
see this key?
Keep it safe. Alright?

739
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,832
And I'll have a word upstairs...

740
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,531
See if I can get somebody
on your case more permanent.

741
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:09,138
It's three days left to e-day,
my true love said to me.

742
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,715
Convert your change
or donate to charity.

743
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,613
Huummmmm, marvellous.

744
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,811
There are just three days
left to e-day.

745
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,516
Remember the money in your bank account
has already been converted.

746
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,717
The easiest way to change
any cash you have

747
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,521
is to pay it into your account.

748
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,426
The Sterling becomes Euros
the moment it's paid in.

749
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,534
And if you don't have an account,
why not open one today?

750
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,828
Can I help you at all?

751
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,335
We'd like to open a bank account.

752
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,336
- Is your mum and dad with you?
- No.

753
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,533
Well I need an adult signature.
I need proof of who you are.

754
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,736
Oh we thought of that.
Leisure pass.

755
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,109
I'm afraid you're going to have
to ask your mum to come in.

756
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,514
This isn't enough.
Just ask your mum to come in.

757
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,621
- We can't.
- Why not?

758
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,817
Our mam's dead.

759
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,635
There's two free euros in here

760
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,937
And you can keep the rest
of your money in it.

761
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,132
It's the best I can do.

762
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,916
I told you.
We should have bought a house.

763
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,214
Right if we can't hide it,
at least we can spend it.

764
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,423
- Hello.
- Now that is quality.

765
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,622
That is amazing.
I can see you. Can you see me?

766
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:36,926
Yeah.

767
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,825
Not here, on there.

768
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:39,936
Not as well.

769
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,130
I can see you in mine.
This is fantastic.

770
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,035
Anthony.

771
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,335
Why don't we give the money
to the lady with the bin?

772
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,343
It's not ours and
we're never going to spend it all.

773
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,707
She could do good with it.

774
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,816
We just gave her a grand and
look at the trouble it caused.

775
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,215
And if we gave her two hundred
we'll end up in jail.

776
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,812
We're on our own now Damian.
Don't let me down.

777
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,539
Hello.
The speaker went on the bin.

778
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,937
Your dad said he'd fix it.
So I said I'd cook for him.

779
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,237
So you get a decent meal for once.

780
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,810
I'm a fantastic cook.
Aren't I a fantastic cook, Damian?

781
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,213
The size of that school bag.

782
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,216
You'll give yourselvesa hernia,
is that all homework?

783
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,513
- No.
- Yeah.

784
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:36,815
Er, costumes for the nativity play.
I suppose it is homework really.

785
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,326
I love a nativity play,
can I see them?

786
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,725
- Yeah.
- No.

787
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,426
It's private. Private property...
of the school.

788
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,627
It will spoil the surprise.

789
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,135
Am I going to go too?

790
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,233
Are you going to get
me some tickets?

791
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:51,941
Well I suppose so.

792
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,542
Well I didn't even know
they were in it.

793
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,043
I get told nothing
you know, nothing.

794
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,312
Are you going to come
and do some chopping?

795
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,713
It's lasagne, your favourite.

796
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,624
Where was the highwaymanan,
Dick Turpin,

797
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,919
hanged in seventeen thirty nine?

798
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,825
- York.
- How did you know that?

799
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,228
- It's York.
- Glasgow... Carlisle...

800
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,526
He knows everything your dad.

801
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,225
- Norwich... York...
- Why don't you go on it,

802
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,530
you'd be great,
wouldn't he, he'd be great.

803
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,535
Fifty fifty please.

804
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,333
It's York!

805
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,942
You'd be a lot less frustrated
if you went on yourself.

806
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,544
Damian, tell him to go on.

807
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,509
You'd like to have a million
pounds wouldn't you?

808
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,208
It's not a million pounds.
It's a million euros.

809
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,012
That's only about...

810
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,821
Six hundred and
twenty three thousand,

811
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,617
one hundred pounds
at today's prices.

812
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,623
At least somebody
has been listening.

813
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:45,921
Told you it was York.

814
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,323
Jim, I'm so sorry
the answer is York.

815
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,731
We're supposed to go to bed
when this is finished.

816
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,133
Yeah right, go to bed.

817
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,640
But you're supposed
to read us a story.

818
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,602
- I'll get off.
- I'll see you out.

819
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,408
I'll see you out too.

820
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,710
I know.

821
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,517
Come again soon.

822
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,323
- Sucker for women.
- Sucker for men.

823
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,734
Don't forget I want to seethat
nativity play. Your dad'llforget.

824
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,337
Go and get your pyjamas on.

825
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,134
They're good lads.

826
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,033
Nice to have someone to talk
to once in a while, though.

827
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:37,909
Yeah. Thanks.
I had a great evening.

828
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,115
I know what she's after.

829
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,615
We can't leave it here.

830
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,311
We're going to have tokeep
it with us...

831
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:45,421
all the time.

832
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,920
Fill your school bag.

833
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,319
And don't let it out your sight.

834
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,724
Guard it with your life,
whatever happens.

835
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,625
- Ok?
- Ok.

836
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,822
Damian?

837
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,125
Have you any room?

838
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,737
- Have youany room?
- No, Damian,

839
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:05,932
Damian he's tired, he's walked
here all the way from Nazareth.

840
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,237
He's tired.
He's very, very tired.

841
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,307
- Well...
- Tired.

842
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,211
The walk fromNazareth,
people did that all the time.

843
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,410
And he was a carpenter.
So he was very fit.

844
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,714
He wasn't tired.
He was excited.

845
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,720
His wife was going to have a baby.

846
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,017
They weren't expecting
to go to sleep.

847
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:27,528
Ok. You say excited.
I say tired. Let's try nervous?

848
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,825
Ok? Shall we start again?

849
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:52,713
Joseph the Worker,
first century, dates uncertain?

850
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:57,623
I wouldn't have said nervous.
I would have said focused.

851
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,136
Well, have you any room?

852
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,406
What did he want to bring her for?

853
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,014
You invited her.

854
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:24,920
Beginners.
Beginners positions.

855
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,215
Damian, come on.

856
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,626
The word went out
from Julius Caesar.

857
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,929
Caesar...

858
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,439
Caesar Augustus that everybody

859
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,543
had to go to their
home town to be taxed.

860
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:51,204
So Mary and Joseph
set out for Bethlehem.

861
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:01,718
# Little Donkey,
# Little Don. Key.

862
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,725
# On the dusty road...

863
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,022
Do you know how much
a piece of gold that big

864
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,222
would be worth at today's prices?

865
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,426
A lot. An awful lot.
I wonder what happened to it?

866
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,436
Because he was poor after that.
I wonder what he spent it on.

867
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,939
Can we please loose
the anachronistic bag?

868
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,942
I don't think they had Addidas
in the first century.

869
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,106
Far away to the East,
three wise men saw a star.

870
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,716
Thanks girls.

871
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,318
Look a star!

872
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:30,612
Let's follow it.

873
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:37,420
# Come, they told me,
# par um pa pa pa pum

874
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:43,922
# A new born King to see,
# par um pa pum pum

875
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,340
No, Saint Maureen.

876
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:59,210
I don't think I have heard of her.
Is she a virgin martyr?

877
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,816
I don't think so.

878
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,023
Here he is.

879
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,319
He's always got
those bags with him.

880
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,223
Pom pom pom...

881
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,131
Do you remember me?

882
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,327
Mmmm...?

883
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,130
I'm the poor man.

884
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,735
Damian Cunningham,
what are you doing there?

885
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,537
Come on, where should you be?

886
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,305
Where should you be,
you should be in Bethlehem,

887
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,311
come on.

888
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,916
I can't believe you've got...
no go back... go back.

889
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,711
As for these.

890
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,717
What have I told you about these?

891
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,414
I've told you before. Ssshhhhh.

892
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,524
Back out! Back out! Back out!

893
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,421
Shhhhh! Back on! Back on!

894
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,926
They tried first at one inn.

895
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,921
Do you have any room
at this inn?

896
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,226
No sorry, we're fully booked.

897
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,531
Do you have any room
at this inn?

898
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,138
We haven't any room,
but we've got a stable.

899
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,806
So he took them to the stable...

900
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,212
Oh, this is nice and cosy,
Joseph...

901
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,919
and cosy Joseph...

902
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,425
I said this is nice
and cosy Joseph.

903
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,827
Damian? Damian?

904
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:29,930
Yes, this is where our
Lord Baby Jesus will be born.

905
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,938
And so our Saviour came,
bringing peace to all the earth.

906
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,909
# Silent night, Holy night...

907
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,312
Quick, come on!

908
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,429
You stay there.

909
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,037
Oh no the keys!

910
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,120
Oh no!

911
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,044
Damian!

912
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,304
- What you doing?
- Dad!

913
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:31,913
Come here!
Oh God!

914
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,312
Come here! Come here!
It's alright.

915
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,816
Let's get you down.
What were you doing?

916
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,215
- Is he all right, Dad?
- There we go,

917
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:39,514
- What's he doing?
- Good lad.

918
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,931
Well he found it!

919
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,729
Ltjust fell out of the sky.
Right in front of me.

920
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,838
I thought it was from God.

921
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,034
From God?

922
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:03,045
It's not really his thing is it,
handing out cash?

923
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:05,814
Why would God hand out...

924
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,916
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,
three hundred and twenty pounds.

925
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:16,616
Blimey!

926
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:20,923
I was going to give it to the poor,
but it was really hard.

927
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,524
Why didn't you tell me?

928
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:28,034
Anthony said not to,
because of the tax.

929
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,841
We could keep some of it though
couldn't we, like a reward?

930
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,840
- Get in.
- Oh!

931
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,912
So what are we going
to do with it then?

932
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:40,208
We're going to hand it in.
All of it.

933
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,113
Well what else can we do?
It's not ours is it?

934
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,818
Hello?

935
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,529
I called round, the door was open.
I've called the police.

936
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,229
I thought you might have come home.

937
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,618
Everyone gets burgled at
Christmas, Dad.

938
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,215
This will be your crime number.

939
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:59,717
So you can get on to your
insurance company.

940
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,030
Of course they can't really
recompense you for this.

941
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,826
I mean they can't give you
your Christmas back can they?

942
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,936
Probably be next Christmas by
the time you get anything back.

943
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:15,333
I don't suppose you've got any
serial numbers, security codes,

944
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,708
anything like that? No?

945
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,410
Well, wouldn't make any difference.

946
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:24,815
It's very rare we get anything back.
Very rare.

947
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,024
Whe know the stolen currency
is around here somewhere.

948
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,525
That's what this is all about.

949
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,323
But they can't do anything about it.

950
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,431
All the banks have been
warned to look out

951
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,329
for anyone making
any large deposits.

952
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,833
And of course,
it's only one day or two,

953
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,339
before they realise
that the money is worthless.

954
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,238
What's that?

955
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,008
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It's just my stuff.

956
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,011
Oh dad, don't.

957
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,315
Oh my God!

958
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,227
This is what they were after.

959
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,132
That's a lot of money.
Where did it come from?

960
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,235
They took our Christmas.
We'll take their cash.

961
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,032
- You can't keep it.
- You're going to keep it?

962
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,537
It belongs to the government.

963
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,834
They were going to burn it.

964
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,237
They were going to burn
all this money,

965
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:55,844
that's a crime if you ask me.

966
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,003
- Definitely.
- But stealing is wrong.

967
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,513
If you steal something,
you have to steal it from somebody.

968
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:01,911
Who would we be stealing it from?

969
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,313
It's not right!

970
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,114
Damian, my house has
just been ransacked.

971
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,314
I work every second God sends
just to cover the mortgage,

972
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,015
to give you a decent home.

973
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,218
And now it's been wrecked.

974
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,721
I am owed this.

975
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,333
- But Da...
- Go to bed.

976
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,435
Now!

977
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,029
- Do you want a story?
- It's wrong.

978
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,036
- Who says?
- God.

979
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,334
Yeah, well.

980
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,306
Yeah, well what?

981
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,611
- Don't you want to go to heaven?
- Look around you, Damian.

982
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,612
We're on our own.

983
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,418
No one is smiling
down on us Damian.

984
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,216
No one is is looking out for us.

985
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,722
So we're looking out
for ourselves.

986
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,726
- But mam...
- Is dead.

987
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,525
She's dead, Damian.

988
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:29,033
You'll never see her again.
And neither will I.

989
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,310
And the money, is ours.

990
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,815
We'll take it to town tomorrow
and change it and spend it,

991
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,315
do you hear me?

992
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,716
All of it, because it's ours.

993
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,117
I know you've got it.
It's mine.

994
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,321
And you're going to change
it tomorrow.

995
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:32,723
And that's a good thing. Ok?

996
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,236
When you come back.

997
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,816
I'm going to call you
on this phone.

998
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:52,714
Open the front door.
Let me in.

999
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:55,614
And we'll take the money.

1000
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,424
And you won't have
to worry about it any more.

1001
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,932
Understand?

1002
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,315
You make sure your
phone's switched on.

1003
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,624
...fifteen.

1004
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,231
You take one side and we'll
take the other and then swap.

1005
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,731
- All right.
- Ok change what you can

1006
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,528
and what you can't change spend.

1007
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:41,931
Have a ball!

1008
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,840
You do realise, you just
kissed goodbye to the money.

1009
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,443
Come on let's get cracking.

1010
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,602
She's going to run off with it,
you must know that?

1011
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,214
- Come on!
- How can she, she's got Damian?

1012
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,409
She'll kidnap him, hold him to ransom
for the rest of the money.

1013
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,512
No, Anthony,
that's what you'd do. Come on.

1014
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,726
Ok, you wait here all right?

1015
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:20,737
It's mine.

1016
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,208
We'll have to change more
than this.

1017
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,318
- No!
- What?

1018
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,714
That's the whole point,

1019
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:35,312
do it in small amounts and
no one will be suspicious.

1020
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,818
Look at the queue.
Look at the time.

1021
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,722
We'll be lucky to get round
three banks at this rate.

1022
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,920
You'll be lucky to stay
out the jail.

1023
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:42,428
- Go on!
- What?

1024
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,431
It's just quite
a lot in the circumstances.

1025
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,830
It's five thousand quid.

1026
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,131
It's the front half
of a Ford Fiesta.

1027
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,137
Is this a bank or a sweet shop?

1028
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,602
- What?
- I need a wee.

1029
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,307
Tell her that.

1030
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,710
Can I use your loo?

1031
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,609
- Well I'm not sure...
- Well I'm not queuing up again,

1032
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,617
the poor kid's been
in here half an hour.

1033
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,812
You must have a loo?

1034
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:08,616
What do you do
when you need to go?

1035
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,726
Ok, just this once.

1036
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,534
You'll have to go here.

1037
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,438
I don't really need one.

1038
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,312
You little belter.

1039
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,215
I just can't see
why it's so difficult.

1040
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,319
I need a wee.

1041
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,225
It's the front half of a Ford Fiesta,
as far as I'm concerned, that's...

1042
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,226
I need a wee. I need a wee.

1043
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:04,810
Today's the day, that Britain enters
a new currency era.

1044
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,910
You must spend or bank
any remaining old money today.

1045
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,212
It's now or never.
Use it or lose it.

1046
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:15,119
At midnight tonight,
it's euros only for British business.

1047
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:20,718
Well if you say so for business...
business is... now what was your name.

1048
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,829
- What?
- I've got an idea.

1049
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,831
- What?
- Dollars.

1050
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,835
Change it into dollars now
and change it into euros whenever.

1051
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,030
Actually once
all the excitement's over

1052
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:32,834
the euro will most
likely drop in value.

1053
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,138
So we'll probably get
a better exchange rate this way too.

1054
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:44,715
- What?
- Where did I get you?

1055
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,255
They've got a bank in there.
It stays open late.

1056
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,625
You know everything,
you do, don't you?

1057
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,923
Yeah.

1058
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,228
What's wrong?

1059
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,243
How did you know about the bank?

1060
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:14,115
Is this where your mum worked?
In here?

1061
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:18,817
Well stay there then.

1062
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,717
You'll be alright.
I'll come straight back for you.

1063
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,824
I'll do this one. Ok?

1064
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,636
Don't look.

1065
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,309
This is where
your mum used to work.

1066
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,618
Nice.

1067
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,421
Best get a move on, huh?

1068
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,328
Go on.

1069
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:36,726
Damian? What you doing?

1070
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,129
Hey, what's up?

1071
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,435
Did you think I'd run off
and left you?

1072
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,133
Did you?

1073
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:50,701
Well I didn't, did I?

1074
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,108
No, you didn't.

1075
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:56,918
- The bank's upstairs.
- It's closed.

1076
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,820
And I've had a much better idea.
Come on.

1077
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,823
Let's go and stuff our faces.

1078
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,941
Oh I could have had my eye out.

1079
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,044
Where are the glasses?

1080
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,011
Damian, wants to give
his to the poor.

1081
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,706
Do you?

1082
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,613
Of course they won't be poor anymore,
once you've given it to them.

1083
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,811
What'll do you do then,
take it back?

1084
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,523
Speaking of which...

1085
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:40,219
Right mystery activity...
champagne.

1086
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:42,323
...follow me.

1087
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,236
A woman opens the door
in her nightie

1088
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,607
and I thought funny place
to keep a door...

1089
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:03,011
- This is your fault this.
- What is?

1090
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,812
You don't even know, do you?

1091
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,818
You brought her
and you don't even know.

1092
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,013
What are you on about?

1093
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,521
Can you hear them laughing?

1094
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,523
Even he's laughing. Listen.

1095
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,622
Very good.

1096
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,327
Once she's got what she came for,
she'll piss off again.

1097
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,026
Then he won't be
laughing will he?

1098
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,228
It will all start again
like when mam died.

1099
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,340
- He'll be angry...
- Maybe... she, you know,

1100
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,634
she won't, she'll stay.

1101
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,539
Oh great! Much better.
Is that what you want?

1102
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,010
Her in there with him
instead of mam?

1103
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,114
Why are you angry with me?

1104
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,513
Because you did it.
You and your weird stuff.

1105
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,815
Chucking money away.
Talking to yourself. Seeing things.

1106
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,423
I don't.
I mean maybe I do, but...

1107
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:44,218
And me! Sticking up for you.

1108
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,419
For what?
The truth is, you're a loony!

1109
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,224
Don't say that, Anthony.
Please don't say that!

1110
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,732
You're just a fucking loony
and you should be locked up.

1111
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:13,710
Be at the front door
with the money in ten minutes.

1112
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:11,812
Damian! We were...
I was just...

1113
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,328
Dad, don't answer it.

1114
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,630
- Dad don't.
- What is going on.

1115
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:37,739
Please!

1116
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,034
See this little girls.
My girls.

1117
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:44,009
These girls Santa Claus forgot.
You're our last hope.

1118
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,511
We haven't got a heater home.

1119
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:47,410
Because no point going back
if you don't help

1120
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:48,914
...took it out.
- Just...

1121
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,108
- Who is it?
- Excuse me please.

1122
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,812
Wheelchair like these
need your help.

1123
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,216
Fifty percent of families

1124
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:56,324
with a chronically ill child,
break up.

1125
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,618
You're maybe asking yourself

1126
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,227
why these Waterloo station
need friends.

1127
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,829
Oh, Let me explain.

1128
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,124
This is a mid of night.
This is a privat time.

1129
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,130
Who are you?

1130
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:08,634
Get out please. Get mind.
Just leaving.

1131
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,237
Go on, you and your...
get out.

1132
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,839
- Come on
- Two euro's a month...

1133
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,440
- It's absolutely...
- Would you be prepared

1134
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:14,872
to consider a direct debit.

1135
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,218
Just shut up, will you?

1136
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:51,807
Damian?
Damian?

1137
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,122
This is that same donkey
as he looks after

1138
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,819
just a few months
in our sanctuary.

1139
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:10,022
- I think you'll agree...
- All right love. Put him down.

1140
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,223
Shall we?

1141
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:28,308
You'd better tell me
how this started?

1142
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,210
I've no idea.

1143
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,616
Some one must have said
something strange.

1144
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:33,914
Digital?

1145
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,621
Yeah that's right, yeah.

1146
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:39,818
How do you find it?
I'm yet to be convinced.

1147
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,622
Well you can come and have a look,
when you get rid of that lot.

1148
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,128
Mmm. One step at a time, eh?

1149
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,233
Any chance of a bit of toast?

1150
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,232
You do that,
I'll have a look around.

1151
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,636
Evening, lad.

1152
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:29,837
You.

1153
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,613
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1154
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,310
- Ha? Where is he?
- Upstairs.

1155
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,532
Peaceful isn't it?

1156
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,329
Who are you?

1157
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:34,036
Who am I?

1158
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:39,208
Who are you?

1159
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:41,711
We're the police.

1160
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:33,425
Oh.

1161
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,836
I know you're only a dream.
But I don't care.

1162
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:43,501
It's nice to see you.
Even if you're just a dream.

1163
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,307
The money just makes
everything worse.

1164
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,519
I've got something for you.

1165
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:54,213
From Readers Digest. Here.

1166
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:00,724
You may have already
won ten thousand pounds.

1167
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,223
Please will you talk to me?

1168
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:10,131
Five minutes. Ok?

1169
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,303
Now, don't interrupt.
I'm dead.

1170
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,709
I know what I'm talking about, ok?

1171
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:22,214
You need to use conditioner
on your hair.

1172
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,410
Your dad won't think of that,
but it makes all the difference.

1173
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:28,615
Me?

1174
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,017
You are not to worry about me.

1175
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,030
You have been worrying about me,
haven't you?

1176
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,633
I'm fine.

1177
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,529
Anthony.

1178
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,838
He seems to have taken
it better than you.

1179
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,134
But he hasn't.

1180
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,005
He's got a good heart,
he just...

1181
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,703
he doesn't know where it is.

1182
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,006
Damian?

1183
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:56,417
He's going to need you.
Be good to him.

1184
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,212
Dad doesn't believe.

1185
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,821
Doesn't believe what?

1186
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:06,018
Any of it. Anything.
He mustn't do or he wouldn't.

1187
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,423
Couldn't you talk to him?

1188
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,928
- He can't see me.
- Oh.

1189
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,032
Is it because of the money?

1190
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:17,628
In a way. The money makes
it harder to see what's what.

1191
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,236
You know that already.

1192
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,711
Never really win
with those things anyway.

1193
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,010
You just end up
with books about

1194
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,517
the building of
the American Railways.

1195
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:37,822
It's her isn't it?

1196
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,419
Your dad and her?

1197
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,327
Damian.

1198
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,932
You know how complicated
the money was?

1199
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:58,407
Well... people are even more
complicated.

1200
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,315
You need to remember

1201
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,612
that there is nearly always enough
good around to be going on with.

1202
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:07,220
You've just got to have a bit
of faith, you know.

1203
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:10,324
And if you've got faith in people
that makes them stronger.

1204
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:14,519
And you, you've got enough
to sort all three of you out.

1205
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:20,323
Hey? That's why
I'm counting on you.

1206
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,232
I haven't really
been worried about you.

1207
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,136
I've just been missing you.

1208
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:30,104
That's allowed.

1209
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,306
Are you really a Saint?

1210
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:39,719
Well, the criteria's very strict.

1211
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:42,914
It's notjust a case
of doing good and all that.

1212
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:45,423
You do have to do
an actual miracle.

1213
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,118
So...

1214
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,730
I'm in there. Course I am.

1215
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,729
What was your miracle?

1216
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:54,933
Don't you know?

1217
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:58,429
It was you.

1218
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,810
Hey?

1219
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,819
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

1220
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,423
Bye.

1221
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:13,709
Did you see her?

1222
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,214
What did she say?

1223
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:19,015
She said to tell
you not to worry.

1224
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:21,212
It's all going to be alright.

1225
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,521
She's looking out for you

1226
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:28,626
Come on!

1227
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,905
Well it was fun
while it lasted, eh?

1228
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,225
Look there's no easy way to say this,

1229
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:03,228
but I put a bit to one side,
for me, to spend.

1230
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:05,025
You can have it back.

1231
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:08,727
Dorothy, six thousand,
three hundred and ten euros.

1232
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,428
All for the best, eh?

1233
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:14,134
Dollars.

1234
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,033
It's just a few grand.

1235
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,303
Dad?

1236
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:18,810
Ten really.

1237
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:21,312
Eleven thousand,
four hundred dollars.

1238
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:22,814
I was going to tell you.

1239
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,410
I sort of kept them by mistake.

1240
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,615
Anthony.

1241
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,920
I just enjoyed having a wedge.

1242
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:34,425
It wasn't really the money.
I just liked having it.

1243
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,827
Four thousand,
seven hundred and eighty euros.

1244
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:42,027
Dorothy wanted a holiday
of a lifetime.

1245
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,637
Dad wanted to pay off
all his credit cards.

1246
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,033
Come on Dad.

1247
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,438
Anthony wanted
one game boy advanced xp.

1248
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:52,103
One play station three.
A Shogun new BMX bike.

1249
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,806
A Rekia five hundred super
quad bike.

1250
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:58,316
Nimbus two thousand
eltro-magnetic stair rider.

1251
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:02,321
A table top candy floss maker.
An iPOD, obviously.

1252
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,118
An i B0T obviously.

1253
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,726
And a stamp on it hydraulic
rocket capable of

1254
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:10,319
a attaining altitudes
of over one hundred metres.

1255
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,732
Three...

1256
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:14,232
Two...

1257
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:15,528
One...

1258
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:31,316
That's how Anthony
would want this story to end.

1259
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,215
With big piles of stuff.

1260
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:36,118
But it's not his story.
It's mine.

1261
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:38,623
Oh, regarde ca.
Qu'est-ce-que c'est?

1262
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,823
This is where I want it to end.
