00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,721
Paramount News brings you
a special coverage

2
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,556
of Princess Ann's visit to London,

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,060
the first stop on her much-publicized
goodwill tour of European capitals.

4
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,563
She gets a royal welcome
from the British,

5
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,773
as thousands cheer
the gracious young member

6
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,692
of one of Europe's oldest ruling families.

7
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:03,447
After three days of continuous activity
and a visit to Buckingham Palace,

8
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,407
Ann flew to Amsterdam,

9
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,827
where Her Royal Highness dedicated
the new International Aid Building

10
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,954
and christened an ocean liner,

11
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,497
then went to Paris,

12
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,582
where she attended
many official functions

13
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,125
designed to cement trade relations

14
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,587
between her country
and the Western European nations.

15
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,006
And so, to Rome, the Eternal City,

16
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,968
where the princess' visit was marked
by a spectacular military parade

17
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:30,263
highlighted by the band
of the crack Bersaglieri regiment.

18
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,812
The smiling young princess
showed no sign of the strain

19
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,398
of the week's continuous
public appearances,

20
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,483
and, at her country's embassy
that evening,

21
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,653
a formal reception and ball in her honor

22
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:49,823
was given by her country's
ambassador to Italy.

23
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,883
Her Royal Highness.

24
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:10,271
His Excellency, the Papal Nuncio,
Monsignor Altomonte.

25
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:19,780
Sir Hugo Macy de Farmington.

26
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:23,617
- Good evening, Sir Hugo.
- Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

27
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,786
His Highness
the Maharajah of Khanipur

28
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,580
and the Rajkumari.

29
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,623
I'm so glad that you could come.

30
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:32,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

31
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:38,047
Friherre Erick af
Massinsjarna Bergenskiold.

32
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,635
Prince Istvan Barlossy Nagyavaros.

33
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,638
How do you do?

34
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:54,020
Lhre Hoheit der Furst und die Fursten
von und zu Luchtenstichenholz.

35
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:03,320
Sir Hari Singh and Kmark Singh.

36
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:08,366
The Count and Countess
Von Marstrand.

37
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,618
Good evening, Countess.

38
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:13,663
Good evening.

39
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:22,171
Señor e Señora Joao de Camoes.

40
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,381
Good evening.

41
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,261
Hassan El Din Pasha.

42
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,889
How do you do?

43
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,947
I hate this nightgown.

44
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:26,701
I hate all my nightgowns,
and I hate all my underwear, too.

45
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:29,037
My dear, you have lovely things.

46
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,414
But I'm not two hundred years old.

47
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,958
Why can't I sleep in pajamas?

48
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,251
Pajamas!

49
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,002
Just the top part.

50
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:40,881
Did you know there are people

51
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,884
who sleep with absolutely
nothing on at all?

52
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,887
I rejoice to say that I did not.

53
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:50,807
Listen.

54
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,898
Ann, your slippers.

55
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,197
Please put on your slippers
and come away from the window.

56
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,120
Your milk and crackers.

57
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,622
Everything we do is so wholesome.

58
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,291
They'll help you to sleep.

59
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,212
I'm too tired to sleep.
I shan't sleep a wink.

60
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,340
Now, my dear, if you don't mind,
tomorrow's schedule, or "schedule,"

61
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,926
whichever you prefer. Both are correct.

62
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,679
8:30, breakfast here
with the embassy staff.

63
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,556
9:00, we leave for
the Polinari automotive works,

64
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,850
where you'll be presented
with a small car.

65
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,018
Thank you.

66
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,352
Which you will not accept.

67
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,478
No, thank you.

68
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,856
10:35, inspection of
food and agricultural organization,

69
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,566
will present you with an olive tree.

70
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,859
No, thank you.

71
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,861
Which you will accept.

72
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,904
Thank you.

73
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,825
10:55, the New Foundling Home
for Orphans.

74
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,952
You will preside over
the laying of the cornerstone.

75
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:59,328
Same speech as last Monday.

76
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:00,663
Trade relations.

77
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:01,830
Yes.

78
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,416
For the orphans?

79
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,960
No, no, no, the other one.

80
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:08,461
Youth and progress.

81
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:09,879
Precisely.

82
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:12,965
11:45, back here to rest.
No, that's wrong.

83
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,718
11:45, conference here with the press.

84
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,261
Sweetness and decency.

85
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:20,222
1:00 sharp, lunch with
the Foreign Ministry.

86
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:22,891
You will wear your white lace
and carry a bouquet of

87
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,394
- very small pink roses.
- Very small pink roses.

88
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,897
3:05, presentation of a plaque.

89
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,981
Thank you.

90
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,734
4:10, review Special Guard
of Carabinieri...

91
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:33,860
No, thank you.

92
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:36,278
- 4:45, back here to change...
- How do you do? Charmed.

93
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,239
...into your uniform to meet the...
- So happy...

94
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,448
Stop!

95
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,576
- Good heavens!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

96
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,079
It's all right, dear. It didn't spill.

97
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,289
I don't care if it spilled or not.

98
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:50,208
I don't care if I drowned in it!

99
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,669
My dear, you're ill.

100
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:55,838
I'll send for Dr. Bonnachoven.

101
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,341
I don't want Dr. Bonnachoven!
Please let me die in peace.

102
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,426
You're not dying.

103
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,802
Leave me!

104
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,639
- Leave me!
- It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

105
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,807
I don't want to!

106
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,392
Your Highness!

107
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,603
I'll get Dr. Bonnachoven.

108
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,105
It's no use.

109
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,108
I'll be dead before he gets here.

110
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,158
She's asleep.

111
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:30,328
She was in hysterics
three minutes ago, Doctor.

112
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:34,415
Are you asleep, ma'am?

113
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,541
No!

114
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:41,422
I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness
a moment.

115
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:44,174
I'm very ashamed, Dr. Bonnachoven.

116
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,176
Sudenly, I was crying.

117
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:50,221
To cry, a perfectly normal thing to do.

118
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:52,390
It's most important
she be calm and relaxed

119
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:53,933
for the press conference, Doctor.

120
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,810
Don't worry, Doctor.

121
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,645
I'll be calm and relaxed.

122
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,813
I'll bow, and I'll smile.

123
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:02,399
I'll improve trade relations, and...

124
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,694
There she goes again.
Give her something, Doctor, please.

125
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,404
Uncover her arm, please.

126
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,617
What's that?

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,160
Sleep and calm.

128
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:18,080
This will relax you and
make Your Highness feel a little happy.

129
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:20,499
It's a new drug, quite harmless.

130
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,504
There.

131
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:29,132
I don't feel any different.

132
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,510
You will.
It may take a little time to take hold.

133
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:34,887
Just, now, lie back.

134
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,557
Can I keep just one light on?

135
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,017
Of course.

136
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:41,977
Best thing I know

137
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,855
is to do exactly what you wish
for a while.

138
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,358
Thank you, Doctor.

139
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,071
The General! Doctor, quick!

140
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,869
I'm perfectly all right.

141
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:02,871
Good night, ma'am.

142
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,208
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night, Doctor.

143
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,770
Bet 500.

144
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,314
500. How many?

145
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,066
One.

146
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,029
I'll take one.

147
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,405
Three.

148
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,948
Foolish boy.

149
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:20,788
Two for papa.

150
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:24,875
500 more.

151
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,585
Without looking.

152
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,920
500, and I'll raise you 1,000.

153
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,471
Two pairs.

154
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:41,974
I got three shy little sevens.

155
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:47,771
A nervous straight.
Come home, you fools.

156
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:51,024
Look at that. 6,500.

157
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,359
Not bad. That's 10 bucks.

158
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:56,112
One more round,

159
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:58,864
and I'm going to throw you gents
right out in the snow.

160
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,240
Say, what is this?

161
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,117
I got to get up early.

162
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,577
Date with Her Royal Highness,

163
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,079
who will graciously
pose for some pictures.

164
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:10,416
What do you mean, early?
My personal invitation says 11:45.

165
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,002
Couldn't be anything to do
with the fact that you're ahead?

166
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:14,295
It could.

167
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:18,048
It works out fine for me.
This is my last 5,000,

168
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,760
and you hyenas are not gonna get it.
Thanks a lot, Irving.

169
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,679
Yeah, see you at
Annie's little party in the morning.

170
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,888
- Ciao, Joe.
- Yeah, ciao.

171
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,014
Good night, Joe.

172
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,808
All right, a little seven-card stud.

173
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:29,851
Okay with me.

174
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,823
So happy.

175
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,538
How are you this evening?

176
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,211
Hey, hey, hey.

177
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,754
Hey, wake up.

178
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,047
Thank you very much. Delighted.

179
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,423
Wake up.

180
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:05,050
No, thank you.

181
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:06,843
Charmed.

182
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,889
Charmed, too.

183
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,103
You may sit down.

184
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:20,314
I think you'd better sit up.

185
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,774
You're much too young
to get picked up by the police.

186
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,401
- Police?
- Yep. Police.

187
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:29,280
2:15 and back here to change. 2:45...

188
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:34,911
You know, people who can't handle
liquor shouldn't drink it.

189
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:41,291
"If I were dead and buried
and I heard your voice

190
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:46,755
"beneath the sod
my heart of dust would still rejoice."

191
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,508
Do you know that poem?

192
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,011
What do you know?

193
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:58,307
You're well-read, well-dressed,

194
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,852
snoozing away in a public street.

195
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,980
Would you care to make a statement?

196
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:09,609
What the world needs
is a return to sweetness and decency

197
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:12,236
in the souls of its young men and...

198
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:23,413
Yeah, I couldn't agree
with you more, but...

199
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:38,177
Get yourself some coffee.
You'll be all right.

200
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,366
Look, you take the cab.

201
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:12,125
Come on, climb in the cab
and go home.

202
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:17,046
- So happy.
- You got any money?

203
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,589
Never carry money.

204
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,424
That's a bad habit.

205
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:24,052
All right. I'll drop you off. Come on.

206
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,762
It's a taxi!

207
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:28,181
Well, it's not the Super Chief.

208
00:21:32,477 --> 00:21:34,145
Where are we going?

209
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,896
Where do you live?

210
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,524
Colosseum.

211
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,151
Now, come on. You're not that drunk.

212
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,363
You're so smart. I'm not drunk at all.

213
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:48,825
I'm just being very happy.

214
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,369
There, now, don't go to sleep again.
Come on.

215
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,331
Where are we going?

216
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,835
- Okay.
- Look, now, where do you want to go?

217
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,795
Where shall I take you?

218
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,590
Where do you live?

219
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:09,761
Come on. Come on. Where do you live?

220
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,514
Come on! Where do you live?

221
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,518
Colosseum.

222
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:23,065
She lives in the Colosseum.

223
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,649
Is wrong adress.

224
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,944
Now, look, signore,
for me, it is very late night.

225
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:30,822
Wife. I have three bambino,
three bambino.

226
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,573
You know bambino?

227
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:37,620
My taxi go home.
I go home, too. Together.

228
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:39,622
Via Margutta 51.

229
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,748
Via Margutta 51.

230
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,055
Here is Via Margutta 51.

231
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:00,724
I am very happy.

232
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:03,769
1,000 lira.

233
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:19,158
One, two, three, four mille.

234
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,285
Okay.

235
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,079
For me?

236
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:26,998
Okay, okay. Now, look.

237
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,043
- Take a little bit of that...
- Yeah?

238
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,795
Take her wherever she wants to go.

239
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,509
Good night.

240
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:47,309
- No, no, no, no.
- All right, look.

241
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,185
As soon as she wakes up, see,

242
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,229
she'll tell you
where she wants to go, okay?

243
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:53,648
My taxi is not for sleep.

244
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:57,234
My taxi. No sleep.
Understand? You understand?

245
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:00,112
Look, pal. This is not my problem, see?

246
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,323
I never see her before. Okay.

247
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:06,117
Is not your problem. Is not my problem.

248
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,913
What you want?
You don't want girl, yeah?

249
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:11,914
Me don't want girl.

250
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:15,459
Police! Maybe she want girl.

251
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,003
Okay, okay, okay.

252
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:04,921
So happy... So happy...

253
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,028
I ought to have my head examined.

254
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,574
Is this the elevator?

255
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,410
It's my room.

256
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,792
I'm terribly sorry to mention it,
but the dizziness is getting worse.

257
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:49,003
Can I sleep here?

258
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,714
That's the general idea.

259
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:56,594
Can I have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

260
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,808
I'm afraid you'll have to
rough it tonight, in these.

261
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:04,976
Pajamas!

262
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:08,480
Sorry, honey, but I haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

263
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:13,484
Will you help me
get undressed, please?

264
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:20,449
Okay.

265
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:36,547
There you are. You can handle the rest.

266
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:49,809
May I have some?

267
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:53,187
No.

268
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:55,356
Now, look...

269
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,358
This is very unusual.

270
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,694
I've never been alone
with a man before,

271
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:02,696
even with my dress on.

272
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,992
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

273
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:10,787
I don't seem to mind.

274
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,164
Do you?

275
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,335
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

276
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,088
You'd better get to sleep.

277
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:23,757
No. On this one.

278
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,051
So terribly nice.

279
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:33,141
These are pajamas. They're to sleep in.

280
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:35,559
You're to climb into them.
You understand?

281
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:36,602
Thank you.

282
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:39,563
And you do your sleeping
on the couch, see, not on the bed.

283
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:42,065
Not on the chair, on the couch.
Is that clear?

284
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,859
Do you know my favorite poem?

285
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,735
You've already recited that for me.

286
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:50,240
"Arethusa arose
From her couch of snows

287
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:53,576
"In the Acroceraunian mountains."

288
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,703
- Keats.
- Shelley.

289
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,290
You just keep your mind
off the poetry and on the pajamas.

290
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,374
Everything'll be all right, see?

291
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:01,792
- It's Keats.
- Now, I'll be...

292
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,920
It's Shelley.
I'll be back in about 10 minutes.

293
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:06,213
Keats.

294
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,348
You have my permission to withdraw.

295
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,267
Thank you very much.

296
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,609
- Well?
- No trace, Your Excellency.

297
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:30,944
Have you searched the grounds?

298
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:33,196
Every inch, sir,
from the attics to the cellar.

299
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,990
I must put you on your honor
not to speak of this to anyone.

300
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:40,411
I must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

301
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,081
This must be classified as
top crisis secret.

302
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,457
- Have I your pledge?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,875
Very well.

304
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,963
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

305
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,107
Oh.

306
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,040
So happy.

307
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,459
The pleasure's mine.

308
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:23,588
Screwball.

309
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,717
Holy smoke! The princess interview.

310
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:15,970
11:45.

311
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:03,930
Hi, Joe.

312
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,766
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

313
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,231
Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you.

314
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,820
Thanks a lot, hon.

315
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:22,698
Come in!

316
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:31,456
You've been looking for me?

317
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:32,832
Just coming to work?

318
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:34,208
Who, me?

319
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,836
We start our days at 8:30 in this office.

320
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:37,962
We pick up our assignments...

321
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,172
I picked mine up last night.

322
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:44,051
- What assignment was that?
- The princess. 11:45.

323
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,639
You've already been to the interview?

324
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,599
Sure. I just got back.

325
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,771
- Well, well, well, all my apologies.
- It's all right.

326
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:58,772
- This is very interesting.
- No, just routine.

327
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:01,316
Tell me, tell me, did she answer
all the questions on the list?

328
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,945
Well, of course she did.
I've got them right here somewhere.

329
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:07,864
Don't disturb yourself.
I have a copy here.

330
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,535
How did Her Highness react to the idea
of a European federation?

331
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,538
She thought it was just fine.

332
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,206
She did?

333
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:21,502
Well, she thought that
there'd be two effects.

334
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,544
Two?

335
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:25,589
The direct and the indirect.

336
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,173
Remarkable.

337
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:32,678
Naturally, she thought that the indirect
would not be as direct as the direct.

338
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,265
- That is, not right away.
- No, no, no, no.

339
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:39,059
Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

340
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:44,731
Well, well, well,
that was a shrewd observation.

341
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,068
They fool you, you know,
these royal kids.

342
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,904
They've got a lot more
on the ball than we suspect.

343
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,116
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

344
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
Youth.

345
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:02,039
She felt that the youth of the world

346
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:06,459
must lead the way to a better world.

347
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:08,920
Original.

348
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,673
By the way, what was she wearing?

349
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,719
You mean, what did she have on?

350
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:19,138
That's usually what it means.

351
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,223
What's the matter?
Is it a little warm in here for you?

352
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,975
No, no.
I just hurried over here, that's all.

353
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:25,769
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

354
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:28,188
Did you say she was wearing gray?

355
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,522
No, I didn't say that.

356
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,065
Well, she usually wears gray.

357
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,402
Well, it was a kind of a gray.

358
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:37,530
I think I know the dress you mean.
It has a gold collar.

359
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:39,073
That's the one. That's the one, yeah.

360
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,325
I didn't know exactly
how to describe it, but that's...

361
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:43,910
I think you described it very well,

362
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,247
in view of the fact that Her Highness

363
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,916
was taken violently ill
at 3:00 this morning,

364
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,876
put to bed with a high fever,

365
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,713
and has had all her appointments
for today canceled in toto!

366
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,591
In toto?

367
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:01,802
Yes, Mr. Bradley, in toto.

368
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:06,431
It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

369
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:10,101
In view of the fact that you just left her,
of course.

370
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:11,769
But here it is, Mr. Bradley,

371
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,313
all over the front page
of every newspaper in Rome.

372
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:17,399
All right, all right, I overslept.
It can happen to anybody.

373
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,985
If you only got up early enough
to read a morning paper,

374
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:22,029
you might discover little news events,

375
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,197
little items of general interest

376
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:26,366
that might prevent someone
in the future from getting immersed

377
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:30,328
in such a gold-plated, triple-decked,
star-spangled lie

378
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:32,121
as you have just told me.

379
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,498
If I were you,
I would try some other line of business,

380
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:35,791
like mattress testing.

381
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,084
Is this the princess?

382
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,503
Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

383
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:43,590
It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour,
or Madam Chiang Kai-Shek.

384
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,674
Take a good look at her.

385
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,260
You might be interviewing her
again someday.

386
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:48,678
Am I fired?

387
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,556
No, you're not fired.

388
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,350
When I want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

389
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:56,477
You'll know you're fired!

390
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,523
The man's mad.

391
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,380
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

392
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:30,883
Now, listen carefully.
I want you to hurry up to my place

393
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:33,970
and see if there's
somebody there asleep.

394
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:38,432
Say, Mr. Joe, I look.

395
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:40,684
You wait.

396
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:02,829
Mr. Joe?

397
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:05,248
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:12,171
Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

399
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:13,714
Yes, Mr. Joe?

400
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:17,259
A gun?

401
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,886
No!

402
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,805
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything,

403
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:25,559
but nobody goes in
and nobody goes out.

404
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:27,936
Okay.

405
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:42,699
You still here?

406
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,244
How much would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

407
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:47,912
Are you referring to Her Highness?

408
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,415
I'm not referring to Annie Oakley,
Dorothy Lamour or...

409
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,457
How much?

410
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,543
What do you care?
You got about as much chance as...

411
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:56,087
I know, but if I did,
how much would it be worth?

412
00:37:56,128 --> 00:38:00,007
Just a plain talk on world conditions
might be worth 250.

413
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:04,302
Her views on clothes, of course, would
be worth a lot more, maybe 1,000.

414
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:05,387
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

415
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,390
I'm talking about
her views on everything.

416
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:14,061
The private and secret
longings of a princess.

417
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:15,563
Her innermost thoughts,

418
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,940
as revealed to
your Rome correspondent

419
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:24,738
in a private, personal,
exclusive interview.

420
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,869
Can't use it, huh?

421
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,622
I didn't think you'd like it.

422
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,001
Come here.

423
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,921
Love angle, too, I suppose?

424
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:44,631
Practically all love angle.

425
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,675
With pictures.

426
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,343
Could be. How much?

427
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:52,597
That particular story will be worth
five grand to any news service.

428
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,683
But tell me, Mr. Bradley,
if you are sober,

429
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,894
just how you are going to obtain
this fantastic interview.

430
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:02,481
I plan to enter her sickroom
disguised as a thermometer.

431
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:05,942
You said five grand?
I want you to shake on that.

432
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,780
And you realize, of course,
Her Highness is in bed today

433
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:11,823
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

434
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:12,907
Yep.

435
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,951
Now, I'd like to make
a little side bet with you.

436
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:18,871
500 says you don't
come up with the story.

437
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:27,337
What are you looking at that for?

438
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,421
I just want to see what time it is.

439
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,298
- Huh?
- What day it is.

440
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:32,675
It's a deal!

441
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,802
Now I'd like you to shake.

442
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:41,600
Let's see, you're into me
for about 500 now.

443
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:44,811
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me 1,000.

444
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:47,522
Why, you poor sucker,
I'll practically own you.

445
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:50,108
You have practically owned me
for a couple of years now.

446
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,484
But that's all over.

447
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:52,819
I'm going to win that money,

448
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:56,655
and with it, I'm gonna buy me
a one-way ticket back to New York.

449
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:59,241
Go on, go on, I love to hear you whine.

450
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:02,452
And when I'm back in a real newsroom,
I'll enjoy thinking about you,

451
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,538
sitting here
with an empty leash in your hands

452
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:07,082
and nobody to twitch for you.

453
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:09,292
So long, pigeon!

454
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:37,276
Hey, Joe. What you know?

455
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:41,447
Is everything okay, Giovanni?

456
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,909
Nobody she's come. Nobody she's go.

457
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:46,993
Absolutely nobody.

458
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,870
Swell. Thanks a lot.

459
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:54,000
Giovanni...

460
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,128
How would you like
to make some money?

461
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,213
- Money?
- Yeah.

462
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:03,467
That's the stuff.
Now, look, I've got a sure thing.

463
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,344
Double your money back in two days.

464
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:07,595
Double my money?

465
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,265
Yeah, well, I need
a little investment capital

466
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:11,391
to swing the deal.

467
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:14,393
Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash...

468
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:21,525
You owing me two months' rent,

469
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:25,112
and you want me to lend you money?

470
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:26,655
- Yeah.
- No.

471
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,993
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

472
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,596
Your Highness?

473
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:43,100
Your Royal Highness?

474
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:49,105
Yes, what is it?

475
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:32,158
Dear Dr. Bonnachoven...

476
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:40,290
Sure, yes, well, you're fine. Much better.
Is there anything you want?

477
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,834
So many things.

478
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:45,587
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.
- So...

479
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,006
Tell the good doctor everything.

480
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,676
I dreamt, and I dreamt.

481
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:55,429
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

482
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:02,811
I dreamt I was asleep in the street,
and a young man came.

483
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:09,275
He was tall and strong,
and he was so mean to me.

484
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:12,570
He was?

485
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:21,745
It was wonderful.

486
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:55,693
Good morning.

487
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,199
Where's Dr. Bonnachoven?

488
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,577
I'm afraid I don't know anybody
by that name.

489
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,579
Wasn't I talking to him just now?

490
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,038
Afraid not.

491
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,085
Have I had an accident?

492
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:16,045
No.

493
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,257
Quite safe for me to sit up?

494
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:23,135
Perfect.

495
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,313
Thank you.

496
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:46,781
Are these yours?

497
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:55,956
Did you lose something?

498
00:46:56,832 --> 00:46:57,875
No.

499
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:05,715
Would you be so kind
as to tell me where I am?

500
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,928
Well, this is what
is laughingly known as my apartment.

501
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,555
Did you bring me here by force?

502
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,267
No, no, no. Quite the contrary.

503
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,355
Have I been here all night, alone?

504
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,940
If you don't count me, yes.

505
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,529
So I've spent the night here with you?

506
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:35,326
Well, now, I don't know
that I'd use those words, exactly,

507
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:41,373
but from a certain angle, yes.

508
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:58,973
How do you do?

509
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:00,349
How do you do?

510
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:03,018
- And you are...
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

511
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:05,103
Delighted.

512
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:07,814
You don't know
how delighted I am to meet you.

513
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:09,607
You may sit down.

514
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:11,484
Thank you very much.

515
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:18,616
What's your name?

516
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,996
You may call me Anya.

517
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:27,666
Thank you, Anya.

518
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:31,836
Would you like a cup of coffee?

519
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:34,505
- What time is it?
- About 1:30.

520
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:37,341
1:30! I must get dressed and go!

521
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:40,344
Why? What's your hurry?
There's lots of time.

522
00:48:40,386 --> 00:48:44,181
No, there isn't, and I've been
quite enough trouble to you as it is.

523
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,515
Trouble?

524
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,227
You're not what I'd call trouble.

525
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,354
I'm not?

526
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:54,941
I'll run a bath for you.

527
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:13,583
There you are.

528
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,581
Here we go now.

529
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:02,211
There you are. That does it.

530
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:06,590
Give me a little slack, will you?

531
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,927
Irving! Why don't you
answer the phone?

532
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,470
Look, this is Joe.

533
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:14,597
Irving, can you get over here
in about five minutes?

534
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,266
No, I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy.

535
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,101
No.

536
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,813
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

537
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:26,816
Go and get into your next outfit,
will you, honey? The canoe.

538
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,318
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

539
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,528
Look, Irving,
I can't talk over the telephone.

540
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,696
One word in the wrong quarter,

541
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,156
and this whole thing
might blow sky-high.

542
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,033
It's front-page stuff.
That's all I can tell you.

543
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,285
It might be political
or it might be a sensational scandal.

544
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,829
I'm not sure which, but it's a big story.

545
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,914
It's got to have pictures.

546
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,792
But I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy...

547
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,295
I'm busy now, and I'm meeting
Francesca at Rocca's in a half an hour.

548
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:49,434
Don't understand.

549
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,081
There you are.

550
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:17,543
I was looking at all the people out here.

551
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:20,504
It must be fun to live in a place like this.

552
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,256
Yeah, it has its moments.

553
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,674
I can give you a running commentary
on each apartment.

554
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,092
I must go.

555
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:29,429
I only waited to say good-bye.

556
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:32,723
Good-bye? Why, we've only just met.

557
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:37,561
- How about some breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

558
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:41,482
It must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

559
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:43,191
It is.

560
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:45,861
Well, I'll go along with you,
wherever you are going.

561
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:49,155
That's all right, thank you.
I can find the place.

562
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:53,910
Thank you for letting me
sleep in your bed.

563
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,372
That's all right. Think nothing of it.

564
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:00,332
It was very considerate of you.

565
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:03,418
You must have been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

566
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,587
No. Do it all the time!

567
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:13,052
- Good-bye, Mr. Bradley.
- Good-bye.

568
00:53:17,473 --> 00:53:19,683
Go right through there
and down all the steps.

569
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,101
Thank you.

570
00:53:52,422 --> 00:53:55,132
Well, small world.

571
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:58,719
Yes. I almost forgot.
Can you lend me some money?

572
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,016
Yeah, that's right.
You didn't have any last night, did you?

573
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,480
How much was it that you wanted?

574
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:13,983
Well, I don't know how much I need.
How much have you got?

575
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:18,654
Well, suppose we just split this 50-50?
Here's 1,000 lira.

576
00:54:18,737 --> 00:54:21,532
1,000? Can you really spare all that?

577
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:23,825
It's about $1.50.

578
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,538
Well, I'll arrange for it
to be sent back to you.

579
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,415
What is your adress?

580
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,543
Via Margutta 51.

581
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:35,461
Via Margutta 51.

582
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:37,755
Joe Bradley.

583
00:54:38,547 --> 00:54:40,382
Good-bye. Thank you.

584
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:56,522
Double my money, eh?

585
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:58,065
You tell me why
double my money that way?

586
00:54:58,148 --> 00:54:59,983
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

587
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:01,568
Yeah, tomorrow.

588
00:57:35,543 --> 00:57:38,587
What a wonderful hair you have.

589
00:57:40,547 --> 00:57:41,882
Just cut, thank you.

590
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:43,258
Just cut?

591
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,845
Well, then, cut so?

592
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,763
Higher.

593
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,223
Higher?

594
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:51,349
Here?

595
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:52,517
More.

596
00:57:54,393 --> 00:57:56,020
- Here?
- Even more.

597
00:57:58,022 --> 00:57:59,189
Where?

598
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:02,484
There.

599
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:03,735
There?

600
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:06,071
Are you sure, miss?

601
00:58:06,154 --> 00:58:08,198
I'm quite sure, thank you.

602
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,661
All off?

603
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:14,996
All off.

604
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,706
Off.

605
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,050
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

606
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:32,053
Yes.

607
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:36,766
Off!

608
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:43,313
Off!

609
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:49,903
Off.

610
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,666
Off!

611
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:27,103
That's a nice little camera
you have there.

612
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:28,480
It's nice.

613
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,401
You don't mind if I just
borrow it, do you?

614
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:34,527
- Miss Weber!
- Bring it right back.

615
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,113
- Just for a couple of minutes.
- No.

616
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:40,115
Let go. It's my camera.

617
00:59:48,998 --> 00:59:51,125
You musician, maybe?

618
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,419
You artist?

619
00:59:54,837 --> 00:59:56,088
Painter?

620
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:00,134
I know. You model.

621
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,844
Model.

622
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:04,304
Thank you.

623
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:06,973
It's perfect.

624
01:00:07,015 --> 01:00:10,226
You be nice without long hair.

625
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,812
Now is cool. Cool?

626
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:15,856
Yes. It's just what I wanted.

627
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:20,819
Now, why you not
come dancing tonight with me?

628
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:23,322
You should see. Is so nice.

629
01:00:23,363 --> 01:00:28,118
Is on a boat on the Tiber,
the river by Sant'Angelo.

630
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:30,245
Moonlight, music, romantic.

631
01:00:30,328 --> 01:00:32,914
Is very, very... Very!

632
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,582
Please? You come?

633
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:36,208
I wish I could.

634
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:44,341
But your friend,
I not think they recognize you.

635
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,427
No, I don't think they will.

636
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,888
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

637
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:56,727
After 9:00, I will be there,
dancing on river.

638
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:58,437
Remember, Sant'Angelo.

639
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,855
All my friends...

640
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:03,317
If you come,
you will be most pretty of all girl.

641
01:01:07,612 --> 01:01:08,988
Thank you.

642
01:01:09,697 --> 01:01:10,990
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

643
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,047
Thank you.

644
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:41,782
1,000 lira.

645
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:43,158
No money.

646
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:48,580
I'm sorry. I've really no money.

647
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:53,709
Look.

648
01:02:59,506 --> 01:03:00,924
I'm sorry.

649
01:03:34,497 --> 01:03:36,665
Well, it's you.

650
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,459
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

651
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,835
Or is it?

652
01:03:41,628 --> 01:03:42,713
Do you like it?

653
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:44,756
Yeah. Very much.

654
01:03:48,802 --> 01:03:51,512
So that was
your mysterious appointment.

655
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:53,598
Mr. Bradley, I have
a confession to make.

656
01:03:53,681 --> 01:03:55,016
Confession?

657
01:03:55,057 --> 01:03:57,768
Yes. I ran away last night,

658
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,396
from school.

659
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:02,064
What was the matter?

660
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:03,982
Trouble with the teacher?

661
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:05,192
No, nothing like that.

662
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,819
Well, you don't just run away
from school for nothing.

663
01:04:07,902 --> 01:04:10,363
I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

664
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:13,741
They gave me something last night
to make me sleep.

665
01:04:14,533 --> 01:04:15,701
I see.

666
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:20,539
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

667
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:23,625
Well, look, before you do,

668
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:26,711
why don't you take
a little time for yourself?

669
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:29,214
Maybe another hour.

670
01:04:29,255 --> 01:04:31,883
Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

671
01:04:33,384 --> 01:04:35,511
I could do some of the things
I've always wanted to.

672
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:36,971
Like what?

673
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:38,472
You can't imagine.

674
01:04:38,555 --> 01:04:42,309
I'd like to do just whatever I like
the whole day long.

675
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:44,895
You mean, things like
having your hair cut, eating gelato?

676
01:04:44,936 --> 01:04:49,941
Yes, and I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe
and look in shop windows,

677
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:52,360
walk in the rain.

678
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:54,946
Have fun, and maybe some excitement.

679
01:04:56,363 --> 01:05:00,284
- Doesn't seem much to you, does it?
- It's great.

680
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,536
Tell you what.

681
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:05,789
Why don't we do
all those things together?

682
01:05:05,872 --> 01:05:07,374
Don't you have to work?

683
01:05:07,457 --> 01:05:09,834
Work? No.
Today's going to be a holiday.

684
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:13,004
But you don't want
to do a lot of silly things.

685
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:14,171
Don't I?

686
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:17,424
First wish, one sidewalk cafe.
Coming right up.

687
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:19,093
I know just the place. Rocca's.

688
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,938
What will the people at school say
when they see your new haircut?

689
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:33,773
They'll have a fit.

690
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:38,652
What would they say if they knew
I'd spent the night in your room?

691
01:05:38,694 --> 01:05:42,906
Well, I tell you what. You don't tell
your folks, and I won't tell mine.

692
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,449
It's a pact.

693
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,493
Well, what would you like to drink?

694
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:48,286
Champagne, please.

695
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,542
Champagne?

696
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,381
And cold coffee for me.

697
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:06,428
Must be quite a life
you have in that school.

698
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:07,804
Champagne for lunch.

699
01:06:07,846 --> 01:06:09,347
Only on special occasions.

700
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:10,640
For instance?

701
01:06:10,682 --> 01:06:13,017
The last time was
my father's anniversary.

702
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,310
Weding?

703
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:19,565
No. It was the 40th anniversary
of the day he got his job.

704
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:23,652
Forty years on the job.
What do you know about that?

705
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:26,154
What does he do?

706
01:06:27,197 --> 01:06:30,533
Well, mostly you might call it
public relations.

707
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:33,035
Well, that's hard work.

708
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,746
- Yes, I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

709
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,998
I've heard him complain about it.

710
01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:39,917
Why doesn't he quit?

711
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,463
Well, people in that line of work
almost never do quit,

712
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:47,465
unless it's actually unhealthy for them
to continue.

713
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,968
Well, here's to his health, then.

714
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:53,304
You know, that's what everybody says.

715
01:06:58,601 --> 01:06:59,935
It's all right?

716
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:01,520
Yes, thank you.

717
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:04,398
What is your work?

718
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:06,900
I'm in the selling game.

719
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:09,527
Really? How interesting.

720
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:11,279
What do you sell?

721
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:15,324
Fertilizer.

722
01:07:15,408 --> 01:07:17,660
Chemicals. You know, chemicals.

723
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,370
Stuff like that.

724
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,212
Irving! Well, am I glad to see you!

725
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,255
Why? Did you forget your wallet?

726
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,882
Pull up a chair, Irving. Sit down with us.

727
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,300
Aren't you going to introduce me?

728
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,262
Yes. This is a very good friend of mine,
Irving Radovich. Anya, Irving.

729
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,390
- Anya...
- Smith.

730
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,266
Hiya, Smitty.

731
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,601
Charmed.

732
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:50,857
Hey, anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

733
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,406
Well, I guess I'll be going.

734
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:03,618
No, don't do anything like that, Irving.
Sit down. Join us. Join us.

735
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:09,749
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

736
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:14,920
Tell me, Mr. Radovich, what is a ringer?

737
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,005
Waiter?

738
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:17,298
It's an American term,

739
01:08:17,381 --> 01:08:22,678
and it means
anyone who has a great deal of charm.

740
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,599
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:33,312
Cousins.

742
01:08:33,646 --> 01:08:37,483
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

743
01:08:37,858 --> 01:08:39,318
I'd like to have heard that.

744
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:40,861
What do you do?

745
01:08:40,944 --> 01:08:43,822
I'm in the same racket as Joe, only I'm...

746
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:47,325
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

747
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:50,119
- What are you...
- I'm sorry.

748
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:53,915
Look, I can take a hint.
I'll see you around.

749
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:55,249
Your drink's just here.

750
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,836
Yeah, here's your drink right now, Irving.
Take it easy.

751
01:08:58,919 --> 01:09:02,339
I'm sorry about that.
Sit down. That's a good fellow.

752
01:09:03,215 --> 01:09:05,175
Have a... That's a boy.

753
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:07,510
You're...

754
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,013
You're twisting my arm, you know.

755
01:09:10,096 --> 01:09:13,891
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

756
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:15,309
Spill? Who's been doing the spilling?

757
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,477
You.

758
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,062
- Me?
- Yeah.

759
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,149
Where did you find this loony?

760
01:09:25,152 --> 01:09:27,278
You're okay. Here's to you.

761
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,822
Here's hoping for the best.

762
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:34,285
If it wasn't for that hair, I'd swear that...

763
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:39,915
Thanks.

764
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:43,502
You slipped, Irving. You slipped,
you almost hurt yourself that time.

765
01:09:43,543 --> 01:09:46,880
I slipped? I almost hurt myself?

766
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:49,048
- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain there.

767
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:50,508
Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe.

768
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,427
We'd better go in here
and get it fixed up.

769
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,845
- Yeah, I'd like to...
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

770
01:09:54,887 --> 01:09:57,139
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

771
01:09:57,223 --> 01:09:59,683
- Come here, pal.
- Joe, now wait a minute.

772
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:01,768
What are you trying to do now?
Take your hands off me.

773
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:03,520
- Have you got your lighter?
- What's that got to do with it?

774
01:10:03,603 --> 01:10:05,981
- Have you got it?
- Yeah, but what are you trying to do?

775
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:08,983
Listen, what would you do
for five grand?

776
01:10:10,443 --> 01:10:12,487
- Five grand?
- Okay, look.

777
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,905
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

778
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:17,950
Look, Irving, this is my story.
I dug it up. I've got to protect it.

779
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:19,743
She's really the...

780
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:23,413
Your tintypes are gonna make
this little epic twice as valuable.

781
01:10:23,497 --> 01:10:26,541
- "The princess goes slumming."
- You're in for 25% of the take.

782
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:29,294
- The take's five Gs.
- Minimum. Hennessy shook hands on it.

783
01:10:30,086 --> 01:10:32,797
- That's $1,500.
- It's $1,250.

784
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:35,174
Okay. Now you shake.

785
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:37,343
Okay, now lend me 30,000.

786
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:40,721
30,000? That's 50 bucks.
Are you gonna buy the crown jewels?

787
01:10:40,762 --> 01:10:42,764
She's out there now drinking
champagne that I can't pay for.

788
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:44,307
We've got to entertain her, don't we?

789
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:47,769
Joe, we can't go running around town
with a hot princess.

790
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:50,605
Do you want in on this deal
or don't you?

791
01:10:57,444 --> 01:10:58,904
This I want back Saturday.

792
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,323
Okay. Now where's your lighter?

793
01:11:02,282 --> 01:11:03,950
Let's go to work.

794
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:13,042
Better now?

795
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:15,795
- Your ear.
- My ear?

796
01:11:16,504 --> 01:11:18,672
Yeah. Joe fixed it.

797
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,092
Would you care for a cigarette?

798
01:11:22,134 --> 01:11:23,593
Yes, please.

799
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:26,846
You won't believe this,
but it's my very first.

800
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,556
Your very first?

801
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,642
No smoking in school?

802
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:34,312
Your first cigarette.

803
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,736
There. The gizmo works.

804
01:11:43,987 --> 01:11:47,032
Well, what's the verdict? Okay?

805
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:48,700
Nothing to it.

806
01:11:48,783 --> 01:11:50,952
That's right. Nothing to it.

807
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:56,749
I'll stretch my legs a little here.

808
01:11:56,832 --> 01:11:58,667
I'll pick this one up, Irving.

809
01:11:58,709 --> 01:12:00,711
Yeah. You can afford it.

810
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:06,299
Well, what shall we do next?
Shall we make out a little schedule?

811
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:08,343
Not that word, please.

812
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:12,472
I didn't mean a work... School schedule.

813
01:12:12,513 --> 01:12:15,224
I meant a fun schedule.

814
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,643
Yes. Let's just go.

815
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,938
Well, how about you, Irving?
Are you ready?

816
01:12:21,688 --> 01:12:23,315
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

817
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:27,569
Francesca!

818
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:30,989
- This is...
- Smitty.

819
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,491
She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

820
01:12:33,533 --> 01:12:35,326
Five grand, Irving.

821
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,537
- Joe!
- Where are you going now?

822
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,499
Honey, I gotta work. I'll call you tonight.

823
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:24,830
Look at those men!

824
01:13:24,913 --> 01:13:27,457
They were supposed
to be inconspicuous.

825
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,667
You asked for plain clothes.

826
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:17,850
Hey!

827
01:15:20,144 --> 01:15:21,937
Stop! Come back here!

828
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,701
- Let me take this...
- No, no. Let it go. I can do it.

829
01:17:17,168 --> 01:17:18,252
Yeah.

830
01:17:18,294 --> 01:17:20,629
I'm going straight from now on.

831
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:24,091
American News Service?
What did he mean?

832
01:17:24,883 --> 01:17:27,010
Well, you know,
you say you're with the press,

833
01:17:27,093 --> 01:17:28,761
you can get away with anything.

834
01:17:29,929 --> 01:17:32,640
Going to church to get married
on a scooter, that's a hot one.

835
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:34,642
Joe's a wonderful liar.

836
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:45,527
Congratulations. Congratulations.

837
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:01,291
You don't have to look so worried.
I won't hold you to it.

838
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,168
Thank you very much.

839
01:18:03,418 --> 01:18:05,754
You don't have to be too grateful!

840
01:18:05,837 --> 01:18:07,339
Okay, I won't.

841
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:12,552
I'm a good liar, too,
aren't I, Mr. Bradley?

842
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:14,428
The best I ever met.

843
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:17,181
Thank you very much.

844
01:18:17,389 --> 01:18:18,849
Say...

845
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:21,143
Come with me.

846
01:18:27,482 --> 01:18:28,983
The mouth of truth.

847
01:18:29,025 --> 01:18:33,196
The legend is that if you're given to lying
and put your hand in there,

848
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:34,947
it'll be bitten off.

849
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:36,782
What a horrid idea.

850
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,493
Let's see you do it.

851
01:19:04,891 --> 01:19:06,685
Let's see you do it.

852
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,146
Sure.

853
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:30,707
Hello.

854
01:19:30,748 --> 01:19:31,791
You beast!

855
01:19:31,874 --> 01:19:34,669
It was perfectly all right!
You never hurt your hand!

856
01:19:34,752 --> 01:19:37,171
I'm sorry. It's just a joke.

857
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:38,881
You never hurt your hand.

858
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:41,925
I'm sorry. You okay?

859
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:43,760
- Yes.
- All right. Let's go.

860
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:45,136
Look out!

861
01:19:54,437 --> 01:19:56,355
I'll park at the corner.

862
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:20,627
What do they mean,
all these inscriptions?

863
01:20:21,753 --> 01:20:24,631
Well, each one represents
a wish fulfilled.

864
01:20:25,131 --> 01:20:28,259
It all started during the war when
there was an air raid right out here,

865
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:31,846
a man with his four children
was caught in the street.

866
01:20:31,929 --> 01:20:34,598
They ran over against the wall
right there for shelter

867
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,225
and prayed for safety.

868
01:20:36,308 --> 01:20:39,353
Bombs fell very close,
but no one was hurt.

869
01:20:39,436 --> 01:20:43,523
Later on, the man came back
and he put up the first of these tablets.

870
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,609
Since then, it's become
a sort of a shrine.

871
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:48,445
People come, and whenever
their wishes are granted,

872
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:51,656
they put up another one
of these little plaques.

873
01:20:52,573 --> 01:20:54,075
Lovely story.

874
01:20:57,536 --> 01:20:59,788
Read some of the inscriptions.

875
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,928
Make a wish?

876
01:21:17,263 --> 01:21:18,889
Tell the doctor?

877
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:23,226
Anyway, the chances of it being granted
are very slight.

878
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,313
Well, what now?

879
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:30,191
I've heard of a wonderful place
for dancing on a boat.

880
01:21:30,275 --> 01:21:32,276
You mean, the barges
down by Sant'Angelo?

881
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,861
Yes, couldn't we go there tonight?

882
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:36,113
- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

883
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:39,074
And then at midnight,
I'll turn into a pumpkin

884
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:41,660
and drive away in my glass slipper.

885
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:44,496
And that'll be the end of the fairytale.

886
01:21:44,538 --> 01:21:47,082
Well, I guess Irving has to go now.

887
01:21:47,665 --> 01:21:48,666
I do?

888
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:50,835
Yes, you know, that big
business development of yours

889
01:21:50,918 --> 01:21:53,004
that you have to attend to?

890
01:21:53,379 --> 01:21:54,380
Oh, the development.

891
01:21:54,463 --> 01:21:56,173
Yes, can't afford not to take care of that.

892
01:21:56,215 --> 01:21:58,842
Yeah. I'll see you later, Smitty.

893
01:21:59,218 --> 01:22:02,220
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

894
01:22:27,619 --> 01:22:29,078
Two, please.

895
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:44,231
Hello.

896
01:23:45,482 --> 01:23:46,650
Hello.

897
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,875
Mr. Bradley,
if you don't mind my saying so,

898
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:07,002
I think you are a ringer.

899
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:08,503
A what?

900
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:09,796
Oh!

901
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:11,547
Thanks very much.

902
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:14,925
You've spent the whole day
doing things I've always wanted to.

903
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,093
Why?

904
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,388
I don't know. It seemed the thing to do.

905
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,890
I've never heard of anybody so kind.

906
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,852
It wasn't any trouble.

907
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:28,396
Or so completely unselfish.

908
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:36,320
Let's have a drink at the bar.

909
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:43,910
There you are!

910
01:24:45,203 --> 01:24:48,706
I look for you a long time.
I think maybe you not come.

911
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,834
Off... All off!

912
01:24:51,918 --> 01:24:54,045
It's nice without, isn't it?

913
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:55,254
Cool.

914
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:56,755
Very, very good.

915
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:58,590
This is Mr. Bradley.

916
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,551
I, Mario Delani.

917
01:25:01,134 --> 01:25:02,135
Old friends?

918
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:06,139
Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon.
He invited me here tonight.

919
01:25:07,557 --> 01:25:09,684
Well, what did you say the name was?

920
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:11,144
Delani. Mario Delani.

921
01:25:11,227 --> 01:25:14,272
Mario Delani. I'm very glad to know you.

922
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:15,940
Me, too.

923
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:23,405
May I enjoy myself... The pleasure...
Do you mind?

924
01:25:23,447 --> 01:25:24,990
No, no. Go right ahead.

925
01:25:25,073 --> 01:25:26,408
Thank you.

926
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:53,057
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

927
01:25:53,099 --> 01:25:55,226
Who's Smitty dancing with?

928
01:25:55,309 --> 01:25:57,061
The barber.

929
01:25:57,144 --> 01:26:00,022
Cut her hair this afternoon.
Made a date for tonight.

930
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,232
The princess and the barber.

931
01:27:12,505 --> 01:27:13,881
What is it?

932
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,659
August.

933
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:54,377
Thank you!

934
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:00,007
Bye.

935
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,437
Your Highness.

936
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,440
You'll dance quietly
towards the entrance.

937
01:28:18,524 --> 01:28:20,234
There is a car waiting.

938
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:22,319
- No.
- Your Highness, please.

939
01:28:22,402 --> 01:28:23,862
You've made a mistake.

940
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,615
Let me go. Will you let me go?

941
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:31,035
Mr. Bradley! Let me go, will you?
Mr. Bradley!

942
01:28:57,685 --> 01:28:59,228
Let go!

943
01:29:00,437 --> 01:29:01,605
You...

944
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:49,065
Hit him again, Smitty!

945
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:01,326
- Joe, here are my car keys.
- The police. The police. Come on.

946
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,620
The other side of the bridge.

947
01:31:14,894 --> 01:31:16,061
All right?

948
01:31:16,145 --> 01:31:17,229
Fine. How are you?

949
01:31:17,313 --> 01:31:18,439
Fine.

950
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:26,655
Say, you know,
you were great back there.

951
01:31:26,738 --> 01:31:28,865
You weren't so bad yourself.

952
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,728
I guess we'd better get Irving's car
and get out of here.

953
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,124
This is The American Hour from Rome,

954
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:27,127
continuing our program
of musical selections.

955
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:53,693
Everything ruined?

956
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:56,112
No. They'll be dry in a minute.

957
01:33:00,073 --> 01:33:01,491
Suits you.

958
01:33:01,533 --> 01:33:03,994
You should always wear my clothes.

959
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:06,204
It seems I do.

960
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:13,753
I thought a little wine might be good.

961
01:33:15,337 --> 01:33:17,298
Shall I cook something?

962
01:33:17,339 --> 01:33:20,384
No kitchen. Nothing to cook.
I always eat out.

963
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,053
Do you like that?

964
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:25,555
Life isn't always what one likes.

965
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:27,891
Is it?

966
01:33:29,434 --> 01:33:31,352
No, it isn't.

967
01:33:40,194 --> 01:33:42,112
- Tired?
- A little.

968
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:43,572
You've had quite a day.

969
01:33:43,655 --> 01:33:45,115
A wonderful day.

970
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:46,825
This is The American Hour from Rome,

971
01:33:46,866 --> 01:33:50,411
broadcasting a special news bulletin
in English and Italian.

972
01:33:50,495 --> 01:33:51,704
Tonight, there is no further word

973
01:33:51,788 --> 01:33:53,998
from the bedside
of Princess Ann in Rome,

974
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,374
where she was taken ill yesterday

975
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:58,502
on the last leg of
her European goodwill tour.

976
01:33:59,044 --> 01:34:01,922
This has given rise to rumors
that her condition may be serious,

977
01:34:02,005 --> 01:34:06,009
which is causing alarm and anxiety
among the people in her country.

978
01:34:09,804 --> 01:34:12,014
- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

979
01:34:12,098 --> 01:34:14,350
May I have a little more wine?

980
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:20,647
I'm sorry I couldn't
cook us some dinner.

981
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:23,316
Did you learn how in school?

982
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,193
I'm a good cook.

983
01:34:25,277 --> 01:34:26,861
I could earn my living at it.

984
01:34:26,903 --> 01:34:29,906
I can sew, too,
and clean a house and iron.

985
01:34:29,989 --> 01:34:31,032
I learned to do all those things.

986
01:34:31,074 --> 01:34:35,369
I just haven't had the chance
to do it for anyone.

987
01:34:39,748 --> 01:34:42,376
Well, it looks like I'll have to move

988
01:34:44,044 --> 01:34:46,713
and get myself a place with a kitchen.

989
01:34:51,676 --> 01:34:52,760
Yes.

990
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,869
I shall have to go now.

991
01:35:36,926 --> 01:35:38,135
Anya...

992
01:35:40,345 --> 01:35:44,307
There's something
that I want to tell you.

993
01:35:48,311 --> 01:35:49,729
No, please.

994
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,273
Nothing.

995
01:36:06,328 --> 01:36:08,371
I must go and get dressed.

996
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:51,202
Stop at the next corner, please.

997
01:36:51,244 --> 01:36:52,370
Okay.

998
01:37:09,594 --> 01:37:10,720
Here?

999
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:13,306
Yes.

1000
01:37:22,356 --> 01:37:24,357
I have to leave you now.

1001
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:34,909
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

1002
01:37:36,827 --> 01:37:39,538
You must stay in the car
and drive away.

1003
01:37:40,831 --> 01:37:43,792
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

1004
01:37:45,418 --> 01:37:48,088
Just drive away and leave me,

1005
01:37:50,131 --> 01:37:51,716
as I leave you.

1006
01:37:58,472 --> 01:37:59,848
All right.

1007
01:38:02,476 --> 01:38:04,936
I don't know how to say good-bye.

1008
01:38:08,314 --> 01:38:10,441
I can't think of any words.

1009
01:38:12,985 --> 01:38:14,362
Don't try.

1010
01:40:07,507 --> 01:40:14,013
Your Royal Highness,
24 hours, they can't all be blank.

1011
01:40:16,807 --> 01:40:18,309
They are not.

1012
01:40:19,768 --> 01:40:23,230
But what explanation
am I to offer Their Majesties?

1013
01:40:23,271 --> 01:40:26,358
I was indisposed. I am better.

1014
01:40:29,068 --> 01:40:33,990
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that I have my duty to perform,

1015
01:40:34,073 --> 01:40:37,284
just as Your Royal Highness
has her duty.

1016
01:40:37,368 --> 01:40:40,996
Your Excellency,
I trust you will not find it necessary

1017
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:42,956
to use that word again.

1018
01:40:43,749 --> 01:40:49,212
Were I not completely aware
of my duty to my family and my country,

1019
01:40:49,295 --> 01:40:51,839
I would not have come back tonight,

1020
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,680
or, indeed, ever again.

1021
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:12,859
And now, since I understand
we have a very full schedule today,

1022
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,112
you have my permission to withdraw.

1023
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:35,504
No milk and crackers.

1024
01:41:43,303 --> 01:41:46,431
That will be all, thank you, Countess.

1025
01:42:47,028 --> 01:42:49,155
Is it true? Did you really get it?

1026
01:42:49,197 --> 01:42:50,490
Did I get what?

1027
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:53,576
The princess story. The exclusive.
Did you get it?

1028
01:42:53,659 --> 01:42:54,827
No, no, I didn't get it.

1029
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,704
What? But that's impossible.

1030
01:42:56,787 --> 01:42:58,163
Have a cup of coffee or something?

1031
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:00,499
- Joe, you can't hold out on me.
- Who's holding out on you?

1032
01:43:00,582 --> 01:43:01,667
- You are.
- What are you talking about?

1033
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:03,001
I know too much.

1034
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:04,252
First you come into my office

1035
01:43:04,336 --> 01:43:06,171
and ask about
an exclusive on the princess.

1036
01:43:06,254 --> 01:43:07,714
Next, you disappear.

1037
01:43:07,797 --> 01:43:10,216
Then I get the rumor from
my contact at the embassy

1038
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,343
that the princess isn't sick at all
and she's out on the town.

1039
01:43:12,385 --> 01:43:13,803
What kind of a newspaperman are you?

1040
01:43:13,886 --> 01:43:16,138
You believe every two-bit rumor
that comes your way?

1041
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:18,724
Yeah, and a lot of other rumors

1042
01:43:18,807 --> 01:43:21,101
about a shindig on a barge
down by the river

1043
01:43:21,184 --> 01:43:22,936
and the arrest of
eight Secret Service men

1044
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,230
from a country which shall be nameless.

1045
01:43:25,313 --> 01:43:28,358
And then comes the news
of the lady's miraculous recovery.

1046
01:43:28,441 --> 01:43:29,984
It all ads up.

1047
01:43:30,568 --> 01:43:33,529
And don't think by playing hard to get
you'll raise the price of that story.

1048
01:43:33,613 --> 01:43:35,114
A deal's a deal.

1049
01:43:35,197 --> 01:43:38,367
Now, come on, come on,
where is that story?

1050
01:43:39,785 --> 01:43:41,411
I have no story.

1051
01:43:43,163 --> 01:43:45,582
- Then what was the idea of...
- Joe!

1052
01:43:47,417 --> 01:43:49,919
- Man, wait till you see these.
- Irving...

1053
01:43:50,003 --> 01:43:52,046
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy.
You got here at the right time.

1054
01:43:52,088 --> 01:43:54,757
- Irving...
- Wait till you get a look...

1055
01:43:55,925 --> 01:43:56,926
What's the idea?

1056
01:43:57,009 --> 01:43:59,678
What do you mean charging in here
and spilling things all over my place?

1057
01:43:59,762 --> 01:44:00,804
Who's spilling?

1058
01:44:00,888 --> 01:44:02,723
You did.
I spoke to you about that once before.

1059
01:44:02,806 --> 01:44:04,558
Don't you remember?

1060
01:44:04,599 --> 01:44:05,600
Joe, look at my pants.

1061
01:44:05,684 --> 01:44:07,727
Yeah, you'd better come in here
and dry them off, Irving.

1062
01:44:07,769 --> 01:44:09,395
Nuts to that.

1063
01:44:09,938 --> 01:44:11,481
- Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?
- Irving...

1064
01:44:11,564 --> 01:44:12,690
Smitty?

1065
01:44:12,773 --> 01:44:13,899
- Mr. Hennessy...
- Irving...

1066
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,359
Wait till...

1067
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:17,736
There you go again, Irving.

1068
01:44:20,614 --> 01:44:21,698
Joe.

1069
01:44:22,282 --> 01:44:23,825
- All right, save that till later.
- Listen...

1070
01:44:23,909 --> 01:44:27,579
You're here early, anyway.
Why don't you go home and shave?

1071
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,621
Shave?

1072
01:44:28,705 --> 01:44:32,333
Yeah, or else keep quiet till
Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.

1073
01:44:32,416 --> 01:44:34,960
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1074
01:44:35,044 --> 01:44:37,087
What are you two guys up to?
Who's Smitty?

1075
01:44:37,129 --> 01:44:39,298
He's a guy that we met.
You wouldn't care for him.

1076
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:40,507
What am I supposed to look at?

1077
01:44:40,591 --> 01:44:44,344
No, just a couple of Irving's dames.
You wouldn't like them.

1078
01:44:44,594 --> 01:44:45,971
Maybe you would.

1079
01:44:46,054 --> 01:44:49,265
Don't change the subject. When you
came back into my office yesterday...

1080
01:44:49,307 --> 01:44:51,392
Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon,
I thought I had a good lead,

1081
01:44:51,476 --> 01:44:52,935
but I was wrong.

1082
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:55,980
That's all there is to it.
There is no story.

1083
01:44:58,732 --> 01:44:59,858
Okay.

1084
01:45:00,192 --> 01:45:03,695
She's holding the press interview today.
Same time, same place.

1085
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:06,281
Maybe that's one story you can get.

1086
01:45:07,991 --> 01:45:09,951
And you owe me 500 bucks!

1087
01:45:09,993 --> 01:45:11,994
Take it out of my salary,
50 bucks a week.

1088
01:45:12,036 --> 01:45:13,829
Don't think I won't.

1089
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:18,792
Hey, what gives?

1090
01:45:19,376 --> 01:45:20,460
Have we had a better offer?

1091
01:45:20,502 --> 01:45:24,798
Irving, I don't know
just how to tell you this, but...

1092
01:45:26,341 --> 01:45:28,176
Wait till I sit down.

1093
01:45:30,428 --> 01:45:35,307
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these,

1094
01:45:37,226 --> 01:45:38,936
there is no story.

1095
01:45:40,854 --> 01:45:42,147
Why not?

1096
01:45:43,899 --> 01:45:46,484
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1097
01:45:58,537 --> 01:46:02,958
Hey, the pictures came out pretty well.
You want to have a look at them?

1098
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,471
How about a blowup
from a negative that size?

1099
01:46:20,057 --> 01:46:22,684
- That's her first cigarette.
- Oh, yeah. At Rocca's.

1100
01:46:22,768 --> 01:46:24,769
Hey, the mouth of truth.

1101
01:46:26,813 --> 01:46:28,857
Oh, you want to know
the caption I had in mind there?

1102
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:30,608
"Barber cuts in."

1103
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:35,905
Well, here's the one I figured
would be the key shot for the layout.

1104
01:46:35,988 --> 01:46:38,198
"The wall where wishes come true."

1105
01:46:38,282 --> 01:46:39,825
Joe, that's good.

1106
01:46:39,908 --> 01:46:43,203
Lead off with that,
then follow up with the wishes.

1107
01:46:43,995 --> 01:46:45,914
I dug that up out of the file.

1108
01:46:45,997 --> 01:46:47,999
"Princess inspects police."

1109
01:46:48,082 --> 01:46:49,209
Yeah.

1110
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:52,211
"Police inspects princess."

1111
01:46:53,588 --> 01:46:55,047
How about it?

1112
01:46:55,089 --> 01:46:58,092
- Joe, I got a topper for you.
- Pretty good...

1113
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:00,677
Wow!

1114
01:47:00,761 --> 01:47:02,137
- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1115
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,014
Is that a shot, Joe?

1116
01:47:04,514 --> 01:47:06,224
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1117
01:47:06,308 --> 01:47:08,268
Yeah. No, how about this?

1118
01:47:08,351 --> 01:47:10,269
"Crowned head."

1119
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:13,356
I get it! That's... Joe, you got...

1120
01:47:19,945 --> 01:47:21,738
She's fair game, Joe.

1121
01:47:22,364 --> 01:47:25,033
It's always open season on princesses.

1122
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,662
You must be out of your mind.

1123
01:47:29,746 --> 01:47:31,789
Yeah, I know, but...

1124
01:47:31,873 --> 01:47:36,335
Well, look, I can't prevent you from
selling the pictures if you want to.

1125
01:47:36,794 --> 01:47:39,588
- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah!

1126
01:47:46,845 --> 01:47:48,972
You going to the interview?

1127
01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:50,390
Are you going?

1128
01:47:50,473 --> 01:47:53,017
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1129
01:47:53,768 --> 01:47:54,894
Yeah.

1130
01:47:59,982 --> 01:48:01,483
I'll see you.

1131
01:48:16,956 --> 01:48:19,166
It ain't much, but it's home.

1132
01:48:30,051 --> 01:48:33,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
please approach.

1133
01:49:02,122 --> 01:49:03,874
Her Royal Highness.

1134
01:49:33,025 --> 01:49:37,696
Your Royal Highness,
the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

1135
01:50:14,438 --> 01:50:15,731
Ladies and gentlemen,

1136
01:50:15,815 --> 01:50:18,901
Her Royal Highness will now
answer your questions.

1137
01:50:18,984 --> 01:50:21,570
I believe at the outset, Your Highness,

1138
01:50:21,653 --> 01:50:25,073
that I should express
the pleasure of all of us

1139
01:50:25,115 --> 01:50:27,951
at your recovery from the recent illness.

1140
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:31,746
Thank you.

1141
01:50:32,914 --> 01:50:35,958
Does Your Highness believe
that federation would be

1142
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:39,586
a possible solution
to Europe's economic problems?

1143
01:50:41,421 --> 01:50:44,090
I am in favor of any measure

1144
01:50:44,174 --> 01:50:47,719
which would lead to
closer cooperation in Europe.

1145
01:50:49,178 --> 01:50:52,056
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness,

1146
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:55,434
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

1147
01:50:56,644 --> 01:50:58,645
I have every faith in it,

1148
01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:05,068
as I have faith in relations
between people.

1149
01:51:10,615 --> 01:51:16,203
May I say,
speaking for my own press service,

1150
01:51:16,287 --> 01:51:20,832
we believe that Your Highness's faith
will not be unjustified.

1151
01:51:24,503 --> 01:51:27,130
I am so glad to hear you say it.

1152
01:51:30,133 --> 01:51:33,970
Which of the cities visited
did Your Highness enjoy the most?

1153
01:51:43,186 --> 01:51:45,105
Each in its own way...

1154
01:51:48,233 --> 01:51:52,570
Each in its own way was unforgettable.

1155
01:51:53,362 --> 01:51:55,489
It would be difficult to...

1156
01:51:57,992 --> 01:51:59,118
Rome.

1157
01:51:59,993 --> 01:52:02,454
By all means, Rome.

1158
01:52:05,832 --> 01:52:12,088
I will cherish my visit here
in memory as long as I live.

1159
01:52:18,886 --> 01:52:21,930
Despite your indisposition,
Your Highness?

1160
01:52:24,266 --> 01:52:25,767
Despite that.

1161
01:52:26,851 --> 01:52:29,062
Photographs may now be taken.

1162
01:52:58,088 --> 01:53:01,883
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

1163
