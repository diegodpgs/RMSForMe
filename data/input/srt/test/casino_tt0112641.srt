00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,300
All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

153
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,300
who barely had
enough gas money...

154
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,400
to come and pick up
his own fuckin' check.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
And of course it was
the bosses' man...

156
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,300
Andy Stone,
who gave all the orders.

157
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,700
Not the chairman
of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.

158
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,800
I understand.
I understand.

159
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,900
Now all they needed was...

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,900
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,200
And who better than Ace? I mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

162
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,200
and he had
the fuckin' place clocked.

163
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,800
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin' a casino...

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
I don't know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

166
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

167
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,600
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

168
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,200
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

169
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,300
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

170
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,500
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

171
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
while they're processing
your application.

172
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,500
They got a ten-year backlog.

173
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
What happens when
they do find out?

174
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,400
Why would they
want to find out?

175
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,300
We're puttin' a hundred million
into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?

176
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,000
They'll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

177
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,500
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

178
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,600
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

179
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I know guys been workin' there
for 30 years, don't have a license.

180
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

181
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,900
You know if I did it,
l'd have to run it my way.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,700
You got it.

183
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm serious, no interference.

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Nobody's gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

185
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,700
I guarantee it.

186
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,100
[ Nicky ] And that's how
they got Ace to take over.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,800
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

188
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,700
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

190
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,000
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

192
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,700
But he didn't bet
like you or me.

193
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,400
You know, havin' some fun
with it, shit like that.

194
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

195
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,200
He bet like a fuckin'
brain surgeon.

196
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Place the checks properly.

197
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
He had to know everything,
this guy.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,100
He'd find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

200
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,800
and that's what he'd put
his money on.

201
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Even back home, years ago...

202
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,500
when we were first hangin' out...

203
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,100
he'd know if the quarterback
was on coke...

204
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
I'll take Columbia for 20.

205
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,200
He'd get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

207
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
He even figured out
the different bounce...

208
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,900
on college basketball courts,
you know?

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
He'd be workin'
on this shit day and night.

211
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,000
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn't know.

212
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,400
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

213
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,100
Season after season...

214
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,700
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
But he was so serious
about it all...

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,900
that I don't think
he ever enjoyed himself.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But that's just the way he was.

218
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,700
But back then, the bosses
didn't give a fuck...

219
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,700
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

220
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
To them, he was
a cash register.

221
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,300
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

222
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,000
Especially Remo...

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,300
who was a fuckin' degenerate
gambler who always lost...

224
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,200
Cazzo!
[ Mumbles In ltalian ]

225
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,800
All those fuckin' sweeps.

226
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,700
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

227
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

228
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

229
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,100
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

230
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,800
I mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

231
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,000
crooked fuckin' zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

232
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,900
He told fuckin' Remo everything.

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

234
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money...

235
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,300
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,300
Son of a bitch!

How the hell did you get
Oklahoma-Michigan?

238
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi--
How the hell'd you do it?

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,500
Well, that's why
they paid so well.

240
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
You see?
Never tells me nothin'.

241
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,600
What do we got on
for next week?

242
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,500
Well, it's a little too early.
l'd say Thursday would be good.
Is that all right?

243
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,300
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.

244
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,200
7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up? Okay, Ace?

245
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Hey, Nick. Vien acca.

246
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,700
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.

247
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,700
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

248
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,600
He's makin'
a lot of money for us.

249
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,700
And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of
money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

Not like your fuckin' friends

- Okay?
- All right.

- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah. Want me to take this for you?

253
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,800
[ Nicky ] So now,
on top of everything else...

254
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around
with the golden Jew.

Yeah, we made a great pair.

I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

258
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,700
The old men loved us,
and why not?

259
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
- They all made money with us.
- They payin'?

260
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week,
like they're supposed to.

261

- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don't see any money.

Who's this guy?

264
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,300
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine. I laid nine.
- It was eight.

265
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Ace, tell him the line
on the Bear game.

266
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,300
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.

267
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?

- Is this yours? Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,500
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.

273
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,800
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen...

274
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
and shove it up your ass,

You hear a little girl, Frankie?

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little fuckin' girl?

281
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,900
What happened
to the fuckin' tough guy...

to figure out why the guy was saying...

285
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,100
what he was saying,
Nicky just hit him.

286
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,500
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

287
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,800
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

288
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,200
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

289
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,700
And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

290
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,400
because he'll keep coming
back and back...

[ Nicky ] Listen,
with me protectin' Ace...

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,700
he made a fortune
for the bosses.

294
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,900
I mean, that's
what got him to Vegas.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,700
He was a money machine.

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,400
A tremendous earner
for these guys.

297

As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin' drop.

With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

301
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
# Don't you mess with me #

302
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,700
# But you know I'm down #

303
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
# Everybody knows I'm down ÷÷

304
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,900
[ Ace ] In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

305
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,100
I mean, without us, these guys,
they'd still be shoveling mule shit.

307
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Ward, you've got to keep
a cleaner space.

308
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
If you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Won't happen again, Sam.

310
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,500
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won't
happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

311
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
Is this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What's the story?

312
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,900
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

314
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,400
I wouldn't give the bum
a mop job.

315
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,900
These yokels ran the state.

317
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,400
Thank you very much,
Senator.

318
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
- They passed the laws,
they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.

319
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,100
- I had dozens of politicians
and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

320
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
coming through that place
every week.

321
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,900
- Help the Senator,
get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,300
Why not make him happy?

323
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,800
...the Presidential Suite.

324
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,900
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

325
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,600
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

326
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,900
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,300
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

328
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,700
It's a whale
like K.K. lchikawa...

329
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,500
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

330
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,500
that's the one
you really gotta watch.

331
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

332
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,700
to turn out your lights.

333
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,600
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman lslands.

334
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,600
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

335
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,700
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

336
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,300
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

337
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,300
free private jets and
two million of our money.

338
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
But we got him back.

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

340
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.

341
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,400
I can't understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,900
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

344
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,600
I can't believe that there's
a convention; there's no room.

345
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,600
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

346
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

347
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, no. No gambling.

348
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,200
And once he was back,
he played small.

349
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,100
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

350
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,900
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa...

352
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,900
was that they can't bet
small for long.

353
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
He didn't think of it
as winning 10,000...

354
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,100
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

355
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,900
So, he upped his bets.

356
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,800
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

357
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,900
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

358
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and keep them coming back.

359
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,400
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

360
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,600
In the end, we get it all.

361
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,500
# Goddamn it
Trying to make it real #

362
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,400
# Compared to what #

363
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
# Sock it to me #

364
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,200
In Vegas, everybody's
gotta watch everybody else.

365
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,500
Six. All right,
who's gonna give me that?

366
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

367
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
Each and every roll,
all right.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,800
- the dealers are watching
the players...
- Six.

369
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,500
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.

370
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,300
the floormen are watching
the boxmen...

371
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,000
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

372
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

373
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,700
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

374
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm watching the casino manager...

375
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,000
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

376
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

377
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,500
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

378
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,400
# Tryin' to make it real
compared to what #

379
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes!

380
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,500
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

381
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,900
Lookin' good.
Lookin' good.

382
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,800
Let's go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

383
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,700
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

384
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,700
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

385
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,100
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

386
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,300
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice--

387
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,100
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

388
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

389
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

390
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,700
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

391
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

392
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,900
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

393
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
What money? I've seen
you stealing from me.

394
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

395
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,100
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.

396
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,500
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

397
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,200
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

398
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

399
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,300
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

400
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,500
# Slippin' and a-slidin' #
Changin' and a-hidin' #

401
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
# Been told a long time ago #

402
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,500
# I been told
Baby, you've been born #

403
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
# I won't be your fool no more
Oww #

404
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,600
# Baby, oh, baby #

405
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,400
# My sweet baby #

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,600
# You're the one #

407
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
[ Ace ] What a move.

408
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
I fell in love right there.

409
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,800
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

410
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,600
# What's different about him #

411
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,200
# I don't really know #

412
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

413
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,100
# No matter how I try #

414
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,700
# I just can't make him cry #

415
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,600
- [ Ace ] Ginger's mission
in life was money.
- I'll be right back.

416
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,500
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

417
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,200
She was a queen
around the casino.

418
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,900
She brought in high rollers...

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

420
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

421
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,500
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,300
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

423
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,900
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

425
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,500
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

426
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

427
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

428
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

429
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,600
# You only make me glad #

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,600
# Better listen, little girl #

431
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,200
# You're goin' walkin'
down the street #

432
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,800
# I ain't got no love #

433
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,300
Any change?

434
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,100
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

435
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,800
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

436
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,200
# This heart of stone #

437
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,600
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.

438
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

439
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,100
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

440
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,100
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

441
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
And that's what Vegas
is all about.

442
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

443
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,800
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.

444
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Thank you. You too.

445
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,300
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

446
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
pit bosses, floor managers...

447
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,300
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

448
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,700
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

449
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,400
Ginger took care of the parkers...

450
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
because they took care
of the security guards...

451
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,000
- who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

452
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,300
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

453
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

454
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,800
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

455
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
But one thing
I just could never understand...

456
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,800
was that she could have
everything under control...

457
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,900
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

458
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,800
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

459
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

460
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,800
in this thing, okay?

461
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,100
You're gonna get yours back,
and you're gonna get back first, okay?

462
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,300
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

463
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,600
Where are you? You're
in that place. Where are you?

464
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,600
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.

465
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,000
Where are you?
Where are you?

466
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm always here for you.

467
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,400
- You're my woman.
- I know.

468
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,300
[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn't
even look at this creep.

469
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

470
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

471
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,900
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

472
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,500
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

473
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

474
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

475
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,200
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

476
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
Somebody had
to take care of him.

477
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,200
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

478
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,100
If you find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

479
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,000
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

480
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,600
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

481
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,500
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

482
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
- Look at me, pal,
I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

483
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
# Volare #

484
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

485
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,800
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

486
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,000
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,100
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

488
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,200
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

489
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,400
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

490
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,900
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster.

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,100
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

492
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,600
Look at this. Beautiful!

493
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,900
I mean, that's what worried me.
'Cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

494
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,600
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.

495
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,800
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.

496
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,800
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.

497
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,300
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

498
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
What's that?
Huh, what's that?

499
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,000
There's no more.
Thanks, hon.

500
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,900
[ Nicky ] I couldn't wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

501
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
But the bosses didn't send me
out there to have a good time.

502
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

503
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin' skim.

504
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,200
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?

505
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
Hey, Sammy.

506
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,300
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.

507
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,500
Welcome to Vegas.

508
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

509
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,700
Ginger.

510
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,900
Holy shit. What've you
been doing out here?

511
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,700
Honey, come here.

512
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,600
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they're dear friends of mine.

513
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,000
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

514
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, Sammy.

515
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,800
[ Ace ] After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

516
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,000
and we took a ride to talk.

517
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,000
And then, he hit me with it.

518
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,600
What do you think about me
moving out here?

519
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,000
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?

520
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,000
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

521
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,800
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

522
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,700
it's no joke out here,
it's no joke.

523
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You gotta keep a low profile.

524
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,500
It's not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don't like guys like us.

525
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,900
And this sheriff's
a real cowboy.

526
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Even the coppers aren't afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

527
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,300
I don't care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

528
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm tired of that shit
back there.

529
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Look at this place.
It's made of money.

530
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,500
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

531
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,400
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

532
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,500
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

533
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,400
I really gotta be careful.

534
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm running a licensed place,
everything's legit.

535
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

536
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,300
I'm especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

537
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,900
[ Nicky ]
Ace saw Vegas one way...

538
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,000
- You call this guy
and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.

539
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
but I saw it another.

540
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,000
I saw it as untouched.

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

542
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and drug dealers
I could shake down.

543
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
So I started gettin'
everybody in line.

545
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,400
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

546
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,900
I figured out a way
not to lose.

547
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,100
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

548
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,100
It wasn't very scientific,
but it worked.

549
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,000
When he won, he collected;

550
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,600
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

551
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,900
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

552
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,400
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?

553
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,600
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

554
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Oh, Nicky. I thought
you was layin'.

555
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
No, no, I'm takin'.
I was takin'.

556
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,400
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

557
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,200
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?

558
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Maybe if I stick your fuckin'
face through this window...

559
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,700
you'll get unconfused.

560
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.

561
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,500
I didn't mean anything by it.

562
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,100
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?

563
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,600
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.

564
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,300
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

565
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,000
George Washington was born--

566
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,800
[ Ace ] But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

567
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,300
Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

568
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,500
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

569
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,500
Beautiful, you got
a beautiful swing.

570
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,000
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

571
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,700
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

572
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,800
was a fuckin'
metro intelligence cop.

573
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,800
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.

574
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
He's gotta realize that everything
can't be a home run that he does.

575
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,100
That's exactly what
I keep tellin' him...

576
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,600
but that's the kind of kid he is.

577
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,600
[ Ace ] And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,000
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

579
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,300
people got the message.

580
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
[ Nicky ] Me, that's why
the bosses sent me out here.

581
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,800
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

582
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,300
Like these two fuckin'
balloon heads over here.

583
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,000
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin' grand...

584
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,900
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey! How are you?

585
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
How are you?
What are you doing here?

586
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
I'm over here now.

587
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,300
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.

588
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,500
We're waiting on Carmine.

589
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah, we're looking
for Carmine.

590
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,900
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

591
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,100
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

592
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,000
He's gone?

593
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
He's not here?

594
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,300
Carmine's out?

595
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,500
I think maybe he went
across the street...

596
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,700
or somewhere else
or somethin'.

597
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,200
Well, listen, good luck

But I didn't mind,

[ Lester ]
Can you feel my eyes on you?

752
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,300
Can you feel me
look into your heart?

753
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,200
Can you feel me
in the pit of your stomach?

Can you feel me in you?

Don't make me come there.

[ Ginger Crying ]
I love you.

But, baby, do you know
that I love you too?

760
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,500
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?

761
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,400
This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now.

[ Lester ] That's right.
So it's going to be okay.

You have real security.

I see you 14 years old.

I see you the first second
I ever saw you.

- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you,
that's what I see.

Talk to you later.

I'm not crying.
[ Sniffles ]

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,400
Maybe you shouldn't
drink so much.

You just have to understand.

791
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,800
I've been with Lester
since I was a kid.

792
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,200
I just wanted to say good-bye.

it's too much...

if I wear these
all on the same day?

Do I keep my promises or
do I keep my promises?

So wonderful. The jewelry's
not so bad either.

827
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,300
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.

Come on. Can I keep this one
in the house?

- What I'm gonna tell you
is very important.
- Okay.

All this stuff
doesn't mean anything.

Money, this doesn't mean
anything without trust.

to trust you with my life.

to have a lot of payoff cash around.

under the name
of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.

00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,200
Wanna do me a favor? Take your feet off
the table and put your shoes back on.

905
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,100
Fuck you!

906
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,700
I want you to exit this guy
off the premises...

907
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,100
and use his head
to open the fucking door.

908
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,900
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?

909
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,700
Bullshit. I ain't goin'
anywhere with you.

910
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,900
- Bullshit. You're outta here.
- Fuck you!

911
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,200
You know who you're
fucking with? Do you?

912
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,100
You fucking faggot! Do you know
who you're fucking with?

913
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,500
Leave me alone!
[ Grunting ]

914
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,000
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!

915
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,300
Sure enough, an hour later,
I get the call.

916
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,100
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

917
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?

918
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,400
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

919
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,100
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?

920
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,400
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.

921
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,200
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?

922
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,400
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?
- [ Grunting ]

923
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,000
[ Grunting Continues ]
Come here. Come here.

924
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,400
You go over there.
You apologize.

925
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,600
You better hope
he lets you back in.

926
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,500
If you get outta line again,
I'll smash your head so hard...

927
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,400
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on.

928
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,800
Fuckin' hick.
Sammy, listen.

929
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,800
This guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

930
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,300
He doesn't know that
we're dear friends.

931
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,500
I mean, he's already
very sorry.

932
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,200
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

933
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,400
I swear he'll never
get out of line again.

934
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,800
If he does it again,
he's out for good.

935
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,400
I don't care what it is,
I'll never let him in the place again.

936
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm sorry about this, really.

937
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.

938
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,200
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

939
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,900
You shit-kickin',
stinky-horse-manure-smellin'
motherfucker, you!

940
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,600
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in the desert.

941
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,800
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.

942
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,700
[ Roaring ]

943
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,900
# You're dear to me
Yes, sirree #

944
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,400
[ Nicky ] You know,
Ace could be a very touchy guy.

945
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,700
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

946
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Like when he hired
that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

947
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,300
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

948
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,000
But I'll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

949
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,100
He knew all
the fuckin' angles.

950
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,000
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

951
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,000
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

952
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,200
He had to weigh 'em in
once a week to make sure
they didn't blow up like balloons.

953
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,100
She's still eight pounds over.

954
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

955
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,400
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

956
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,500
I'm trying to use respect.

957
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,900
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

958
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,600
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

959
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,600
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

960
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,300
I guess she's frightened. If she doesn't
lose weight she may get fired.

961
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,300
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

962
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,900
- It's been our policy--
- Just stop everything!

963
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,100
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem. She's lazy.

964
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,400
[ Nicky ] Hey,
I gotta give the guy credit.

965
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,600
I mean, he does
the most obvious thing.

966
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,000
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

967
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,200
So why not take advantage, right?

968
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,800
So, he took bookie joints
off the street...

969
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,400
and then opened them up
inside the casino.

970
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,600
Within a few years
by doing all of this...

971
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,200
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him.

972
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,400
[ Ace ]
Between my innovations...

973
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,400
# Look like they're taking
some cat to jail #

974
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,800
and Nicky's dedication
to his job...

975
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,200
# Steamboats are comin' and
they're splashing and goin' #

976
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
I soon had the best
operation on the strip.

977
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,600
# Moon is shinin'
on friends below #

978
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,500
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.

979
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,300
Why?
Somebody's complainin'?

980
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
I'm hearing things
from security.

981
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,700
The sheriff's lookin'
to put you in the Black Book.

982
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,000
That Black Book
is a bunch of bullshit.

983
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,000
They got two names
from the whole country...

984
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,000
and one of 'em
is still Al Capone.

985
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,300
If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

986
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,600
You will not be able
to walk into a casino.

that's all.

I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

it's my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein...

in jail for what I'm doing.

1002
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,100
But out here,
they're giving me awards.

1003
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,400
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

1004
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,900
for charitable donations
to greater Las Vegas.

1005

Congratulations, sweetheart.

1006
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,400
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

1007
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,700
But my greatest pleasure was watching
my wife, Ginger, work the room.

00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,200
- [ Chattering ]
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

1009
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,800
She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.

1010
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
People loved
to be around her.

You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

We'd love to have you there.

- Yes, okay.
- Great.

1014
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,600

- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?
- Hi.

1019
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,200
You're one of the most
gorgeous women I've ever seen.

1020
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,800
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Rothstein.

1021
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,000
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.

1022
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,300
He was a young kid
from the casino.

1023
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,500
Nice kid.
Bright boy.

1024
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,700
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.

1025
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,500
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

1026
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,100
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!

1027
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:50,200
Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

1028
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,900
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!

1029
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,300
they didn't know
what really moved her.

1030
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,100
Look at this. Look at this.
Daddy gave me this--

1031
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,500
And with Ginger happy, I was able
to concentrate on what I knew best.

1032
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,900
Loose machines are
right back over there.

1033
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.

1034
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,400
- Okay, I'll--
- What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1035
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,900
- Well--
- These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

1036
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,000
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.

1037
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,900
- The action is in the front.
Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.

1038
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,800
Listen to me very carefully. There are
three ways of doing things around here:

1039
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,500
the right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1040
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,200
- You understand?
- I do understand that.
I'll get right on it.

1041
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,700
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me. Just do it.

1042
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,800
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

1043
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,000
Dang, you are right,
Mr. Rothstein. I am so sorry.

1044

[ Ace ] So I ended up working--
what, 18-hour days.

1045
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,700
Ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of Vegas.

Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.

What did you say to that
fucking jerk, anyway?

1048
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,000
I told him I was
Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

as well get something out of it.

00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
[ Ace ]
Well, it wasn't long...

1051
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,000
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1052
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,800
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1053
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,600
And from then on,
I couldn't be seen talking
to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1054
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,500
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1055
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,400
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1056
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,400
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1057
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,800
every time he shows up.''

1058
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,000
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1059
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,400
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation--"

1060
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,100
Motherfucker!

1061
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,700
Is there any way
around this?

1062
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,400
No, there's no way.

1063
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,400
Let's say, for instance...

1064
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,900
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1065
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,800
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1066
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,400
Forget it. You can't even
set foot in the parking lot.

1067
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,800
That's how serious it is.

1068
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,100
In other words,
I'm fucked?

1069
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,400
In so many words, yes.

1070
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,500
It just didn't sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1071
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,300
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1072
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,800
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and FBl agent.

1073
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,400
I mean, you're listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

1074
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,000
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.

1075
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,700
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.

1076
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,000
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

1077
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,600
[ Nicky ]
So, once they pulled that shit...

1078
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,700
I started doin' my own things
nobody ever thought of doin'.

1079
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,500
To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my kid brother,
Dominick, and some desperados...

1080
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,400
and started knockin' over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1081
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,100
bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

1082
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,700
I had a good fuckin' crew goin'
for me, I'll tell you that.

1083
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,300
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1084
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,100
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1085
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,700
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1086
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,300
It was like old times.

1087
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,800
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1088
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,100
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1089
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,000
But I didn't like the people
I was rippin' off looking at me...

1090
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,700
so I used to turn
their fuckin' pictures around.

1091
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,600
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1092
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,700
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things
so you don't have to take 'em.

1093
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,500
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1094
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,900
Tell Pepe if he's
switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1095
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,200
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?

1096
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,400
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1097
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1098
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,300
- Yes. Don't worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1099
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,000
[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1100
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,600
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1101
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,700
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.

1102
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,600
Okay, I'll tell him.

1103
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,600
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1104
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,500
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1105
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,600
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1106
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,000
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1107
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,800
Car's coming.

1108
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,800
÷÷ [ Hard Rock ]

1109
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
They were very careful.

1110
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,400
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1111
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,700
if not, they'd drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1112
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,000
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1113
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,600
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1114
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,600
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1115
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,000
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael.

1116
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,800
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1117
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,100
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1118
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,500
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.

1119
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,800
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws.

1120
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,200
[ Nicky ]
Whenever we got local merch...

1121
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,300
we'd usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, I.A.

1122
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,800
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1123
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,300
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1124
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,500
I know his language.

1125
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,400
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1126
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,200
Twenty thousand.
That's my final offer.

1127
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,700
He suddenly talks English. Let's talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1128
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,500
[ Nicky ] I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vault...

1129
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,000
where I kept
the choice stuff.

1130
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,400
I couldn't leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1131
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,600
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1132
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,500
or if my crew got cute.

1133
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,400
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1134
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,200
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1135
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,800
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1136
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,000
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't
even supposed to be doin' it.

1137
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,800
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1138
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,000
that they didn't want anybody
makin' any waves for them.

1139
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,600
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1140
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,500
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1141
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,900
That's why there was
no real organized street stuff
in Vegas before I came here.

1142
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,700
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1143
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,100
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1144
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
that in a venture
of this kind...

1145
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,600
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1146
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:51,600
So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1147
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:55,200
You will try to push it through,
won't you, Mr. Clark?

1148
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,900
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.

1149
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,200
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1150
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,100
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.

1151
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,500
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1152
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,400
Fuckers.

1153
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,000
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1154
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,300
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1155
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,300
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1156
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,300
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?

1157
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,900
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1158
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,700
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1159
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,000
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1160
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,100
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1161
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,400
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1162
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,800
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1163
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,800
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1164
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,600
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1165
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,200
[ Ace ]
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1166
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,900
I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1167
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,100
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1168
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,100
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1169
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,200
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1170
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,600
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1171
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,100
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1172
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,900
Come on. I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1173
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,800
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1174
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,800
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1175
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,800
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1176
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,300
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1177
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,900
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1178
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,400
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1179
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,300
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1180
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,400
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1181
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,400
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?

1182
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,700
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1183
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,300
You know you're a lyin' lowlife,
motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?

1184
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,600
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1185
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,800
I gave you money to pay
the fuckin' rent...

1186
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,000
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1187
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,300
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin' heat's off.

1188
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,500
And you didn't gamble
that fuckin' money?

1189
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,400
- No? You didn't?
- I didn't--

1190
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,600
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.

1191
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,100
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn't gamble?

1192
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,300
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin' money...

1193
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,100
I'll give you the fuckin' money
to put the fuckin' heat on!

1194
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,400
Did you gamble? Huh?

1195
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,600
Fuckin' degenerate.

1196
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,400
Fuckin' kids at home.

1197
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,700
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,700
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1199
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,400
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.

1200
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,600
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1201
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,500
- Two.
- Two?

1202
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,400
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1203
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,800
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1204
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,800
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1205
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,600
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1206
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,300
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,200
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1208
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,200
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1209
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,900
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1210
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,700
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1211
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,900
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1212
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,100
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1213
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,100
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1214
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,100
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1215
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,000
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1216
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,600
The cops knew,
but they didn't give a fuck.

1217
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,600
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1218
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,200
I knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1219
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,400
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1220
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,700
I would carry things out
to a "T."

1221
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,800
Like the time Tony Dogs,
who's supposed to be
the new maniac tough guy in town...

1222
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,200
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1223
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,400
Here's a fuckin' guy
kills two of Remo's guys...

1224
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,700
and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just
workin' on her night off, of all things.

1225
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,000
I mean, this guy's just beggin'
to be made an example of.

1226
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,600
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1227
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,900
And I don't care what you have
to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?

1228
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.

1229
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,200
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1230
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,000
He was one of the toughest
lrishmen I ever met.

1231
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,400
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.

1232
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,800
For two days and two fuckin' nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1233
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,200
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1234
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,800
- Better give me a name soon,
or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1235
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,900
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.

1236
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,500
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin' head in a vise.

1237
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,200
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1238
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,100
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1239
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,100
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a
grapefruit if you don't give me a name.

1240
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,400
Don't make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1241
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,400
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1242
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,900
[ Straining ]
Fuck you!

1243
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.

1244
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,500
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1245
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,300
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?

1246
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,200
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1247
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,500
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!

1248
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,400
[ Straining ]
Charlie M.

1249
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,300
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1250
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,200
You make me pop your
fuckin' eye outta your head...

1251
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,000
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1252
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,000
You dumb motherfucker!

1253
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,100
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1254
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,400
You motherfucker, you!

1255
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,800
Frankie, do him
a fuckin' favor.

1256
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,200
[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally...

1257
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,100
there was a real
gangster in town.

1258
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,200
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1259
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,100
Charlie M.

1260
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,000
[ Bells Ringing ]

1261
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,200
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1262
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,600
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1263
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,000
It's gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1264
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,200
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?

1265
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,700
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

1266
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,300
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.

1267
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,500
Yes, there is.
They won!

1268
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,500
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1269
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,900
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.

1270
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,200
You know goddamn well somebody had
to get into those machines
and set those fuckin' reels.

1271
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,100
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1272
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,600
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.

1273
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,700
What's the matter with you?

1274
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,500
Didn't you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1275
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,700
I think you're overreacting.

1276
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,900
Listen, you fuckin' yokel. I've been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1277
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,300
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?

1278
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,700
I'm firing you.
No, I'm not firing--

1279
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,000
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.

1280
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,300
This is not the way
to treat people.

1281
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
If you didn't know,
you're too fuckin' dumb.

1282
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,800
If you did know,
you were in on it.

1283
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,100
Either way, you're out.
Get out. Come on. Let's go.

1284
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,100
The guy's history
as far as I'm concerned.

1285
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,500
But you can't fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1286
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Everybody with cowboy boots is
a fuckin' county commissioner
or related to a commissioner.

1287
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,800
This is his state.
His uncle's chief judge.

1288
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,200
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1289
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,100
You're in the finances,
you're upstairs.

1290
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,900
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.

1291
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,700
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.

1292
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,300
They're all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1293
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,800
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1294
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,400
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1295
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,200
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1296
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,900
Look at this.
There's nothing.

1297
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,300
Look how many blueberries
your muffin has.

1298
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,700
What are you talking about?

1299
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,100
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1300
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,600
- Where are you going?
- # How long can this go on #

1301
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,700
From now on, I want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1302
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,500
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1303
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,000
Do you know how long
that's going to take?

1304
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,800
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1305
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,300
Just a little.
That a girl.

1306
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,700
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1307
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,600
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.

1308
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,400
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1309
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,800
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1310
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,500
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

1311
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,800
Why don't you take it
out of your account?

1312
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,900
I would, you know, Sam,
it's just that--

1313
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,800
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1314
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,900
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?

1315
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1316
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,900
What's the difference?
I just need it.

1317
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,900
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.

1318
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,900
You're not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1319
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,400
We don't have to turn this
into a big deal.

1320
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,100
Okay? We don't have
to have a fight.

1321
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,800
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.

1322
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,700
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.

1323
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,400
Why can't you tell me
what it's for? Huh?

1324
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,100
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1325
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,600
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1326
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,200
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.

1327
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,400
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1328
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,500
Sam, I've been independent
my whole life. I never had
to ask anybody for anything.

1329
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,500
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1330
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,000
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1331
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,000
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.

1332
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I want to just
be able to trust you.

1333
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,900
You know,

we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1486

What you're saying is libelous,
and you're in no position
to challenge my expertise.

I went way out of my way
to be very helpful to that kid.

He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.

You ain't home.

[ Nicky ] She was doin' pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1627
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,600
But before she could start
countin' her money...

1628
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,300
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1629
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,400
So they sent me.

1630
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,700
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1631
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,200
- What are you talking about?
- She was found
last night shot in the head.

1632
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,300
Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1633
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,400
Her lawyer said
you were partners.

1634
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,000
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1635
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,600
It was never a partnership.

1636
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,500
Did you ever hear
of the .22 Caliber Killer?

1637
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,400
[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1638
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,600
they started looking
at Green too.

1639
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,300
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1640
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,200
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1641
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,400
the casino
was on the up-and-up.

1642
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,000
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1643
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,700
Green's here about
two or three times a month...

1644
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,100
and he's busy
with real estate deals.

1645
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,100
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1646
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,100
I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

1647
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:16,400
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1648
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,600
So day-to-day, then,
you're the boss?

1649
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:22,200
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1650
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,900
when Mr. Green is away.

1651
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
You could say that.

1652
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,500
Hmm, have you read this?

01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,300
Did he really say that?

1658
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,400
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.

1659
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,300
Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1660
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,000
I don't know.
We have to check the files.

1661
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,400
Without gettin' your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?

1662
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:00,400
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass outta town.

- You can't.

until his own lawyers

Maybe he could run things with another

I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

maybe it's time he should quit.

was totally unconstitutional.

about the Supreme Court.
They want you to walk away.

How can I walk away?
Don't you see what's at stake?

The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1959
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,200
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

Not only should you quit,
you should run.

01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,900
Maybe he should get lost
for awhile. Would that be so bad?

- They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break...

1968
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,600
it would give everybody
time to maneuver.

[ Ace Narrating ] Getting a call
from Nicky wasn't easy.

1976
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,800
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

Nicky started out before me...

1989

because it wasn't that easy
for him to get around.

before he could shake all his tails.

[ Ace Narrating ] Meeting in the middle
of the desert always made me nervous.

1996
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,100
It's a scary place.

1997
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,600
I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

1998
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:53,200
And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

1999
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,800
Normally, my prospects
of comin' back alive...

2000
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,700
from a meetin' with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

2001

But this time, when I heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road...

2002
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,200
I gave myself 50-50.

After Ginger took off,
she wasn't much help to anybody.

2882
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:22,300
She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies and bikers in I.A.

2883
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:25,800
In a few months, they went through

After they found her body...

2887
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:55,900
I had a private doctor
do another autopsy.

He said they gave her
a hot dose.

it was amateur night,

Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger side.

But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2894
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:46,800
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver's seat.

It's the only thing
that saved my life.
