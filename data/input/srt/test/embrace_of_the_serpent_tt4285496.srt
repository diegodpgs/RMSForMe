1
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,376
"It is not possible for me to know
if the infinite jungle has started on me

2
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:07,251
the process that has taken many others
to complete and irremediable insanity.

3
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,584
In this case, I can only apologize
and ask for your understanding,

4
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,626
for the display I witnessed
in those enchanted hours was such

5
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,209
that I find it impossible to describe
in words its beauty and splendor;

6
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,459
All I know is that, when I came back,
I had become another man."

7
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:21,942
Theodor von Martius, Amazonia, 1909

8
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,334
Yukuna?

9
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,084
Tukano?

10
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,501
Wanano?

11
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,126
- Kobeu?
- Go away.

12
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,709
Go away!

13
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:12,459
Are you Karamakate, the world mover?

14
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,251
What do you want?

15
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:29,209
I am Manduca, son of Rúibukuri,
of the Maloka Komeilemong.

16
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,959
- I am Bará of the river...
- I know the Barás.

17
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,501
You submitted to the whites
without a fight.

18
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,001
What do you want?

19
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,126
This is Theodor von Martius,
my friend and travel partner.

20
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,792
He is very sick.

21
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:50,792
All of the nearby shamans
tried to heal him. No one could.

22
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,792
They all said you were the only one
who could help us.

23
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,334
I'm not like you.

24
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,542
I don't help the whites.

25
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,834
He is a wise man,
who has come to learn.

26
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,542
He'll die if you don't help him!

27
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,167
Where did you get this?

28
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:14,667
Let go of him!

29
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,042
- Where did you get this?
- What?

30
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,709
The necklace!

31
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:24,167
It was a gift from a Cohiuano shaman.

32
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,376
Liar! The Cohiuano don't exist!

33
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,501
They do exist,

34
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:34,376
I was with them a few years ago.

35
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,542
Liar!

36
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,876
<i>Ayúmpari.</i>

37
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,542
I'm not lying.

38
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,209
Some of them remain,
by the edge of the Yari river.

39
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,917
They are few, but they are still there.

40
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,792
The Cohiuano don't exist anymore.

41
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,417
You killed them all.

42
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,042
I won't help you.

43
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:56,751
It's okay, Manduca. It's okay.

44
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,667
Let's go.

45
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,209
Only yakruna can save you.

46
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:08,334
If the Cohiuano still exist,
then they'll have it.

47
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,209
If not, you will die.

48
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,792
This plant can cure me?

49
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,501
Do my people still exist?

50
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:24,334
The jungle is fragile,
and if you attack her, she strikes back.

51
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,857
The only way she will allow us to travel
is if we respect her.

52
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:29,709
We must not eat meat or fish

53
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:32,376
until the rains begin

54
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,209
and we ask for permission
to the Owners of Animals.

55
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,584
We can't cut any tree from its root.

56
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:41,667
If a woman is found, no intercourse
until the change of moon.

57
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,251
Do you accept?

58
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,626
Theo,

59
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,209
you're in no condition to travel.

60
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,334
I can't die here.

61
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,626
Do you accept?

62
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:01,459
You better be telling the truth.
This medicine only heals momentarily.

63
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:05,626
When it returns,
it will come back stronger.

64
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,459
It's the truth.

65
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,042
I've been with them.

66
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:45,042
EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT

67
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,626
Tukano?

68
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,001
Andoke?

69
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,417
Karihona?

70
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:44,667
Muinane?

71
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,876
You can see me?

72
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,751
Many years ago, this man,

73
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,417
Theodor von Martius,

74
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,501
was here and he wrote
about the plant I'm looking for.

75
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:08,334
I want to know if his writings are true.

76
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,209
I devote my life to plants.

77
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,959
You devote your life to plants?

78
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:17,876
That's the most reasonable thing
I've ever heard a white say.

79
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,001
My name is Evan.

80
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,834
My name was Karamakate.

81
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:30,126
I come downriver from the Maloka
of the Wanano people.

82
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm looking for a plant.

83
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,084
Yakruna.

84
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:35,876
Which plant is that?

85
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,667
I know very little of it.
I don't even know if it exists.

86
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,501
I want to learn about it.

87
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:46,167
Von Martius described it as
a sacred plant that can heal diseases.

88
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:50,626
That grows on the rubber
and raises its level of purity.

89
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,126
Is that why you want it?

90
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,751
Is that mambe?

91
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,209
Do you like our coca?

92
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:18,292
Do you want to take yakruna too?

93
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,167
I can give you a lot of money
if you help me.

94
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,209
It's a lot of money.

95
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,876
Ants like money.

96
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:44,542
I don't. It tastes bad.

97
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,167
I've never dreamt.

98
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,001
Neither awake nor sleeping.

99
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:59,126
Not even

100
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,584
caapi has had any effect on me.

101
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,751
The shamans from the Barás,

102
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,042
Tukano and Siriano villages

103
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,167
said only yakruna

104
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,542
could help me.

105
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,542
I had a dream once of a white spirit.

106
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,334
He was sick,

107
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:27,917
and the only way he could heal
was by learning to dream.

108
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,667
But he couldn't.

109
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,126
Are your dreams
worth a lot of money to you?

110
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,709
Do you know where to find yakruna?

111
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,209
Do you have more mambe?

112
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,292
I have some coca.

113
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,001
Is something wrong?

114
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,876
I forgot mambe existed.

115
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:49,376
Now I don't know how to make it.

116
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:42,501
Will you help me find yakruna?

117
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,626
You are not one.

118
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,209
You are two men.

119
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:56,751
I want to see yakruna.
I'll go with you.

120
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,501
Do you know the way?

121
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,542
I don't remember.

122
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,334
You will take me.

123
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,042
Did you make all these?

124
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,251
What do they mean?

125
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,459
I don't know.

126
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,251
I can't remember.

127
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,376
These rocks used to talk to me.

128
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,209
They answered my questions.

129
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:49,042
The line is broken,
my memories are gone.

130
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,751
Rocks, trees, animals,

131
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,417
they all went silent.

132
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,709
Now they're just pictures on rocks.

133
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,001
Now I'm empty,

134
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,667
I'm a chullachaqui.

135
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:20,209
This is similar
to a drawing I saw of yakruna.

136
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,709
These are mountains.

137
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:39,542
A group of mountains.

138
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,667
It is the "Workshop of the Gods".

139
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,167
That's where

140
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,459
yakruna grows.

141
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,584
How could I forget the gifts
that the Gods gave to us?

142
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:29,251
I've even forgotten
how to make the mambe.

143
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:35,834
What have I become?

144
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,542
We're too heavy.

145
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,292
We need to drop these boxes.

146
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:48,292
No, they're mine. I need them.

147
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,834
They'll drag us down.

148
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,542
- Throw them away.
- They're useful.

149
00:20:58,376 --> 00:20:59,876
You can look at them if you want.

150
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,001
That's not him.
That's his chullachaqui.

151
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,542
What?

152
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:23,292
His chullachaqui.
It looks just like him.

153
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,376
It's a picture.

154
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,042
It happened to us both.
We turned into chullachaquis.

155
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,417
Did you meet him?

156
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:46,167
Do you know what he's like?

157
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:50,001
Is he an old man like me?

158
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,501
No,

159
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:59,417
he died in this jungle.

160
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,459
He never came back from his trip.

161
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,792
How did he give you this?

162
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:11,626
Manduca, his travel partner,
sent his diaries

163
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,251
to Germany.

164
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,084
They were published there.

165
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,876
Manduca, do we have something
to exchange for provisions?

166
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,334
Not a lot.

167
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,376
Are you okay?

168
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,126
Are you better?

169
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,709
The world mover?

170
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,126
This is Karamakate.

171
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,584
He agreed to help me.

172
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:31,501
I have to keep the prohibitions.

173
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,709
You need strength for the travel.
You can eat it.

174
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:40,417
Can I?

175
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:03,709
How do we reach the Yari
from here, then?

176
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:07,834
You must follow the Uraricoera star
all the way to the Igara River.

177
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,251
Which star is that?

178
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,584
The one that is visible
during the sunset, that way.

179
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:15,542
That way?

180
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,876
What is that?

181
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,209
It's a compass.

182
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,292
It always points

183
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,001
to the Auakaruna star.

184
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:39,209
The needle is attracted
by the Earth's magnetic field.

185
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,459
Why?

186
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:45,209
It will always point to the direction
that the Earth's energy indicates.

187
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:47,876
Theo, sing your song!

188
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,792
No! Not again!

189
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,376
Manduca, I will not sing alone.

190
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:00,876
Sing with me!

191
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,876
Come.

192
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:17,876
Who are you?

193
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:24,376
How can you live alone
in the jungle like this?

194
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,834
Manduca,

195
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,626
do you have the compass?

196
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:01,251
Did you leave it in the maloka?

197
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,792
Did any of you take my compass?

198
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,376
Did any of you take my compass?

199
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,084
Give it back.

200
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:33,751
Give it back, you thieves!

201
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:35,834
Which one of you has it?

202
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,542
Leave him, Theo.

203
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,792
I can't leave a compass here, Manduca.

204
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:49,292
Tuschaua, tell them to give it back.

205
00:29:56,417 --> 00:30:00,209
Please, Tuschaua, I need it.

206
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,209
I'm not going to exchange it.

207
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:05,501
Please give it back.

208
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:13,042
Please, Tuschaua, I need it.

209
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:21,792
Let's go.

210
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:25,667
I told you,
I can't leave a compass here.

211
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,376
What?

212
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,876
You're nothing but a white.

213
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,959
Their orientation system is based on
the winds and the position of the stars.

214
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:54,292
If they learn how to use a compass,
that knowledge will be lost.

215
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:57,167
You cannot forbid them to learn.

216
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:00,167
Knowledge belongs to all men.

217
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,667
But you can't understand that,
because you're nothing but a white.

218
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,501
Are you all right?

219
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,459
Leave all that.

220
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,501
They're just things.

221
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,334
No.

222
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:26,126
Why do you whites
love your things so much?

223
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,292
They're not just things.

224
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,292
They are my only bond
to my people in Germany,

225
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:37,626
to my town, my wife, my children.

226
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:41,709
These boxes contain
all the knowledge I've gathered

227
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,542
in four years of travel.

228
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:48,376
I have to keep them,
otherwise nobody will believe me.

229
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:59,667
Leaving them is leaving everything.

230
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,709
You're insane.

231
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,042
I know.

232
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:52,334
The rubber barons gave you those scars?

233
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:55,876
Yes, but I'm a free man now.

234
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:04,959
Is this the spot where the anaconda
descended from the Milky Way,

235
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:07,167
carrying our Karipulakena ancestors?

236
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:31,709
Damn rubber!

237
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,292
Do you understand what he's saying?

238
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,084
He's asking you to kill him.

239
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,959
You brought a gun?

240
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,376
You can't kill him!

241
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:09,501
Manduca, stop it!

242
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:10,876
What are you doing?

243
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,626
If I don't do it,
they'll torture him to death.

244
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,167
Don't do this.

245
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,292
Don't do this!

246
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,834
Nobody deserves this hell.

247
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,542
Manduca, stop.

248
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:05,126
Karamakate.

249
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:15,834
Let's go.

250
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,251
I'm not going.

251
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:21,876
What's wrong?

252
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,959
Whites can't be trusted.

253
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:32,251
I have no reason to trust you either.

254
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,459
So, what do we do?

255
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,292
Is this your knowledge? Shotguns?

256
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,542
All your science only leads to this,
violence,

257
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:43,459
death.

258
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,001
You're wrong.

259
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:48,334
What else are you stealing? Coca?

260
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,459
Quina? Rubber?

261
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:56,334
That's why you want to steal yakruna?
What else are you going to turn into death?

262
00:39:56,417 --> 00:40:00,042
Don't talk to him like that.
He's done more for our people than you.

263
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:03,126
And you? Look at your clothes.
The same as the white men.

264
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,709
How could you let them
culture you like this?

265
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,459
You think like the white men,
you think nothing.

266
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,459
What side are you on? You're a caboclo.

267
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,751
I've never met anyone
more loyal than Manduca.

268
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,501
He has never stopped
defending his people. And you?

269
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,251
What have you done?
Run away from the world,

270
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,001
isolate yourself, like a madman.

271
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,459
I'm not stealing anything.

272
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:35,334
Look!

273
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,334
This is my knowledge.

274
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,792
You try to understand
the world around you too.

275
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,584
You tell stories as well.

276
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:54,584
I send them to my wife,
my people in Germany.

277
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:58,876
This is not death, this is life.

278
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,001
This is my song.

279
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,667
What is this?

280
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,001
It's a drawing I made.

281
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,126
Where did you see it?

282
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,542
In a dream.

283
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,501
A dream of caapi?

284
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:21,834
No. I've never been allowed
to drink caapi.

285
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,626
This is the only dream I've ever had.

286
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:35,542
I ain't no caboclo.

287
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:22,376
If those rubber barons are men,
I am a snake.

288
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,376
Is that a fire?

289
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:29,459
No. It's the Peruvians.

290
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,334
Come.

291
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,459
We must talk to Master Caapi.

292
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,209
- He's the only one who can explain.
- What are you talking about?

293
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,001
The drawing you made. I dreamt it.

294
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,917
But that is not possible.

295
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,417
Of course it's possible.

296
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,459
Do you feel ready to drink?

297
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:11,792
Am I allowed?

298
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,751
Drink without fear.

299
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,501
It's already cleaned you inside.

300
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:29,209
You can drink again.

301
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,709
Drink.

302
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:15,542
You have to let go.

303
00:45:34,376 --> 00:45:35,709
Watoíma.

304
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:39,834
I don't want to die.

305
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,792
I don't want to die.

306
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,126
Why wouldn't Master Caapi
speak to me?

307
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:04,209
I don't understand.
It's never happened before.

308
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,167
What did you see?

309
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,709
The Master took me to see the jaguar.

310
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:20,126
He told me that Watoíma transformed
into a boa when it hit the ground.

311
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:21,959
It has a mandate.

312
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,667
What mandate?

313
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,042
To kill you.

314
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,876
Is this boa my disease?

315
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:43,251
No. It's something else.

316
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,626
If Master Caapi wouldn't talk to me,

317
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:48,209
will yakruna still help me?

318
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:52,334
He spoke to you, but you couldn't listen.
I'll have to show you.

319
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,876
Did the jaguar say something about me?

320
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:03,501
He asked me to protect you.

321
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:16,876
<i>Last night, I finally found
the opportunity to clear that vision</i>

322
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,292
<i>I had back in Germany,</i>

323
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:21,542
<i>lying next to you,</i>

324
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:23,417
<i>all those years ago.</i>

325
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:26,876
<i>I finally had a chance to understand</i>

326
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:29,834
<i>why I imagined a jaguar.</i>

327
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,501
<i>But no matter</i>

328
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:34,667
how hard I tried,

329
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,084
how much I wanted to,

330
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:42,667
I remained completely immune
to the effect of caapi.

331
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:47,292
I feel that I have failed, my love.

332
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:52,834
I will be forced to accept
that my colleagues were right

333
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,542
when they criticized my journey.

334
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:59,917
I fear that I drifted away from you

335
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:03,876
only to die thousands of miles
from our home.

336
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:06,126
I can only hope that this disease

337
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:09,459
is caused by the deep nostalgia

338
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,459
of not having you beside me,

339
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:16,792
and I beg you to forgive me
for expressing these dark feelings.

340
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:22,167
But I also hope, my love,

341
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,042
that you will find in my honesty,

342
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:35,084
another proof of my affection...

343
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:40,209
What is it? Can you understand me?

344
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,459
No, but you look like
you're about to cry.

345
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,376
He's writing to his woman.

346
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,834
I enjoy expressing my affection to her.

347
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:56,334
To a woman?
Before or after you cry?

348
00:48:57,876 --> 00:48:59,209
You cannot understand.

349
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:03,792
And when you go back, are you going
to express your affection to me too?

350
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:07,792
What are you doing?

351
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,667
I have to keep it.

352
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,209
But it's me.

353
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,167
It's not you. It's an image of you.

354
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,209
Like a chullachaqui?

355
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,834
A what?

356
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,917
A chullachaqui.

357
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,126
We all have one.

358
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:36,501
He looks just like you,
but he's empty, hollow.

359
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:40,792
This is a memory.
A moment that passed.

360
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:46,084
A chullachaqui has no memories.

361
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:49,167
It only drifts around in the world,

362
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:51,792
empty, like a ghost,
lost in time without time.

363
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:01,834
Are you going to show my chullachaqui
to your people?

364
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:03,834
If you allow me.

365
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:38,209
The necklace is part of a Cohiuano.
It cannot be exchanged.

366
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,376
You have to stick the paddle
closer to the boat.

367
00:52:44,376 --> 00:52:46,584
Listen, the river can tell you when to row.

368
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:50,376
Like this?

369
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:08,167
Why didn't you go back
to your people before?

370
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,876
The Colombians razed everything.
Nothing was left.

371
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,459
Didn't you ever wish to go back and see?

372
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:26,792
I was only a child.

373
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,876
How did you survive?

374
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:06,167
Another rubber plantation?

375
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:08,501
Not anymore.

376
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:12,751
It says here it's a Mission.

377
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:16,959
We should stop and get some supplies.

378
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,792
No. Let's keep going.

379
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,042
I know this place.

380
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,084
How are our supplies?

381
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:29,542
Not so good.

382
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:34,542
We're stopping.

383
00:55:04,626 --> 00:55:06,501
Hello, little brother.

384
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:07,959
What's your name?

385
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:10,626
Manhekanalienípe.

386
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,959
That's not your name! We're not allowed
to speak in pagan language.

387
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:16,959
My name is Jeremías.

388
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:20,709
Where is the priest?

389
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:26,376
Where is the priest?

390
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,876
Go away!

391
00:56:22,709 --> 00:56:24,667
We don't have any rubber!

392
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,834
We don't want rubber.

393
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,084
What do you want?

394
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,917
My name is Theodor von Martius,

395
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:36,042
I am an ethnographer
of the University of Tübingen

396
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,876
and the Museum of Stuttgart, Germany.

397
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:44,459
These are my travel mates,
Manduca and Karamakate.

398
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,001
What do you want?

399
00:56:47,376 --> 00:56:50,459
We are conducting an expedition

400
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,376
and we are looking
for supplies to trade.

401
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:56,376
Fruits, mandioca, whatever.

402
00:56:56,459 --> 00:56:58,376
Not interested. Go away.

403
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:01,292
I have money. I can pay.

404
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,917
Go away!

405
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:05,626
Let's go.

406
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:08,667
What did he say?

407
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,042
Pagan languages
are not permitted here.

408
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,542
"If thou shall judge me fair to the Lord,

409
00:57:16,626 --> 00:57:19,209
come to my house and stay in it."

410
00:57:19,876 --> 00:57:20,876
Easy.

411
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,584
We can't keep going our way
without food.

412
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:26,501
You're a capuchin, right?

413
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:31,001
Please, help us.

414
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,792
We will stick to your rules.

415
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,751
We will speak nothing but Spanish.

416
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,334
We are men of science.

417
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:42,001
Like St. Thomas Aquinas.

418
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:45,459
"Do not forget to show hospitality,

419
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:49,126
for because of it...

420
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:51,459
...Many unknowingly

421
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,376
hosted my angels."

422
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,459
I doubt you're angels.

423
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:05,376
But it is not for me to refuse
hospitality in the house of God.

424
00:58:06,709 --> 00:58:10,876
Be welcome to the Mission
of San Antonio de Padua in Vaupés.

425
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:52,209
It's forbidden to eat fish
before the rains come.

426
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,667
How long have you been here?

427
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,751
I came after the massacre
of the Peruvians.

428
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,292
It will be ten years soon.

429
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,167
Have you been alone all this time?

430
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:14,042
No.

431
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:19,626
Brother Marcelino and the elders

432
00:59:19,709 --> 00:59:23,417
went looking for new disciples
two years ago

433
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:25,001
and they haven't returned.

434
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:28,501
Didn't you see them downriver?

435
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:36,084
Do you only steal boys?

436
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,709
Our mission is sacred.

437
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:45,167
We must save the souls
of the orphans of the rubber war,

438
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:49,834
and keep them away
from cannibalism and ignorance.

439
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:03,501
IN RECOGNITION OF THE COURAGE OF
THE COLOMBIAN RUBBER PIONEERS

440
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:07,001
WHO BROUGHT CIVILIZATION
TO THE LAND OF CANNIBAL SAVAGES

441
01:00:07,084 --> 01:00:09,626
AND SHOWED THEM THE PATH OF GOD
AND HIS HOLY CHURCH.

442
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:12,292
RAFAEL REYES
PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA, AUGUST 1907

443
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:26,626
Hand me a pot.

444
01:00:33,584 --> 01:00:36,334
I know what it's like in here.

445
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:39,209
Whites are crazy.

446
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:50,126
Come.

447
01:00:52,709 --> 01:00:53,709
Come. Don't be afraid.

448
01:01:01,584 --> 01:01:05,251
Look. This is chiricaspi.

449
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,899
A gift that our Karipulakena ancestors
received from the gods.

450
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:11,459
We received the sun's semen when Yeba,

451
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,459
the sun's daughter, scratched his penis

452
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:17,209
and ground the semen to dust.

453
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:21,167
We must do the same
with this plant before boiling it.

454
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,042
Help me.

455
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:34,042
This is the strongest defense
we have against any disease.

456
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,959
It will help you endure.

457
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,542
Priests picked me up too,
when the rubber barons killed my people.

458
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,001
They didn't surrender to them,

459
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:50,292
they fought.

460
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:52,042
That's what you have to do.

461
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:56,626
Don't believe their crazy tales
about eating the body of their gods.

462
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:59,667
They give you food,

463
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:03,001
but they don't respect the prohibitions.

464
01:02:03,084 --> 01:02:06,459
One day they will finish
all the food in the jungle.

465
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:12,292
You are still small,
so the jungle will forgive you.

466
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:14,417
Master Caapi will guide you.

467
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:18,792
Every plant, every tree,
every flower is full of wisdom.

468
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:24,209
Never forget who you are
or where you came from.

469
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:27,042
Don't let our song fade away.

470
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:49,709
Don't touch me!

471
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:53,542
You brought the devil to the community!

472
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,709
You pervert the innocents!

473
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:18,251
We have to go.

474
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:22,292
- We must take them.
- We can't.

475
01:04:25,459 --> 01:04:26,917
The others will kill them.

476
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:31,959
We can't feed them.

477
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,042
Run.

478
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,626
Run.

479
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,792
Which way?

480
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,417
I don't know. You're the guide.

481
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,001
You could help me.

482
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:33,709
You won't find anything in there.

483
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:16,584
Are you interested in rubber?

484
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:22,126
I've never seen a strain like this.

485
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:24,292
Rubber means death.

486
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:26,959
But it's what you're looking for, right?

487
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:28,959
You are two men.

488
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:30,167
What are you talking about?

489
01:08:30,251 --> 01:08:32,167
Why do you insist on coming with me

490
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:35,876
if you're not going to help me?

491
01:08:37,376 --> 01:08:39,001
I've... remembered.

492
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:41,001
What did you remember?

493
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:46,042
Did you remember where to find yakruna?

494
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:50,417
I remembered something.
I don't know what it means.

495
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:55,167
Maybe I'm not a chullachaqui anymore.

496
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:57,626
Which way?

497
01:08:58,917 --> 01:08:59,917
Right.

498
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:28,042
We're finding what you're looking for.

499
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,251
We have to go back!

500
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:46,042
We can't.

501
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:49,084
They're already here.

502
01:10:00,584 --> 01:10:03,376
I've been here before.

503
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,376
The Messiah is not taking visitors.

504
01:10:48,584 --> 01:10:50,126
We don't want to visit him.

505
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,417
We just wish to go on our way.

506
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:53,751
That is not possible.

507
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,376
The Eden of our community
depends on its secret.

508
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:59,709
We won't tell anyone.

509
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,209
Show me that.

510
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,334
Is this a gift?

511
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:44,542
Are you the wise men of the East?

512
01:11:51,126 --> 01:11:53,959
But there's only two of you...
Balthazar... and Melchior...

513
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:56,459
Where is Caspar?

514
01:11:57,501 --> 01:11:59,709
He... lost his way.

515
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,828
He was invited to suicide
for causing with his betrayal

516
01:12:28,876 --> 01:12:33,501
the sickness that saddens our Eden.

517
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,709
I'm not doing miracles today!

518
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,376
So you're the Wise Men of the East?

519
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,751
We are scientists,

520
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:01,834
looking for sacred plants.

521
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:03,959
Sacred plants?

522
01:14:04,876 --> 01:14:08,126
The only thing sacred
in this jungle is me!

523
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:46,501
Cure her.

524
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:05,292
You have to take her to a hospital.

525
01:15:22,876 --> 01:15:27,209
This girl has leishmaniasis.
You won't be able to cure her.

526
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:01,876
The Messiah is in a bad mood today.

527
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:07,042
But you have to understand,
his wife is sick. I would be upset too.

528
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:20,376
I hope he can cure her.

529
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:25,292
I wouldn't want for you
to be invited to suicide.

530
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:31,542
This is madness.

531
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,042
Don't you care?

532
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:49,334
I do. Something went wrong.

533
01:17:57,917 --> 01:17:59,126
They are now

534
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:04,251
the worst of both worlds.

535
01:18:31,959 --> 01:18:34,459
Grátias agens benedíxit.

536
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:38,501
Accípite et bíbite ex eo omnes:

537
01:18:38,584 --> 01:18:41,376
Hic est enim calix

538
01:18:42,209 --> 01:18:44,751
Mei sánguinis sed aetérni.

539
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:53,792
Quiet!

540
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:57,001
Quiet!

541
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:06,584
Oh, Great Wise Men of the East

542
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:10,251
who have found
the holy path to Bethlehem.

543
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,876
Bless our drink!

544
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,292
He cured my wife,

545
01:19:54,376 --> 01:19:57,292
now he will cure us all!

546
01:20:04,584 --> 01:20:09,334
Let us celebrate this day, brothers!

547
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:47,209
Drink!

548
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:50,876
Drink!

549
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:55,167
I am not worthy of drinking
from the same cup as the son of God.

550
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,001
The son of God.

551
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:04,042
The son of God, I am the Messiah
and Redeemer of the Indians,

552
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:07,709
Manducate ex hoc omnes! Selvus Rex!

553
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,542
The son of God, Agnus Dei!

554
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:13,042
Eat! Eat!

555
01:21:14,084 --> 01:21:15,376
Eat me!

556
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:30,501
Everyone, eat me!

557
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:33,667
Let us eat the body of the Lord!

558
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:28,209
There's too much weight.

559
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:41,042
What the hell are you doing?

560
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:43,792
Stop bothering me!

561
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,876
What's your problem with these boxes?

562
01:22:47,959 --> 01:22:51,792
Your things will only lead you
to madness and death.

563
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:55,792
What are you talking about?
You poisoned them!

564
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:57,334
I didn't poison them

565
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:59,459
I just gave them something
to think better.

566
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:04,167
They are Makús.
They were not born of the anaconda.

567
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:09,334
They are less than human.

568
01:23:09,876 --> 01:23:12,917
You sound like
one of those rubber barons.

569
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:19,001
You're just like them.
And you're lying to me.

570
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:22,709
You remember everything.

571
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:37,792
Don't. Please, stay.

572
01:23:39,751 --> 01:23:42,459
I still feel like a chullachaqui.

573
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:44,792
But I'm starting to remember.

574
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:49,334
My mission was to give this knowledge
to my people.

575
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:54,834
But the rubber barons
and the Colombians came.

576
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:58,042
And I was left alone.

577
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,209
I need to remember.

578
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:04,501
I need to continue
the song of the Cohiuano.

579
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,876
Are you going to show me the way?

580
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,376
I don't know it.
You have to find it for yourself.

581
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:13,126
Throw away your luggage.

582
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:54,292
There. Happy?

583
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:57,542
Show me that box.

584
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:00,834
I'm not going to let you throw it away.

585
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:04,876
Then show it to me.

586
01:25:19,501 --> 01:25:21,084
What is it?

587
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:56,709
This sound calms me.

588
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:02,709
It takes me back to my father's house
in Boston, to my ancestors.

589
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:04,542
To become a warrior, every Cohiuano man
must leave everything behind

590
01:27:04,626 --> 01:27:08,876
and go into the jungle,
guided only by his dreams.

591
01:27:08,959 --> 01:27:10,334
In that journey,

592
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:13,876
he has to discover, in solitude
and silence, who he really is.

593
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:18,626
He has to become
a vagabond of dreams.

594
01:27:19,584 --> 01:27:24,209
Some get lost and never come back.

595
01:27:24,292 --> 01:27:28,126
But those that do,

596
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,376
are ready to face whatever may come.

597
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,542
Where are they?

598
01:27:41,376 --> 01:27:43,856
Where are the chants that mothers
used to sing to their babies?

599
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:46,292
Where are the stories of the elders,
the whispers of love,

600
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:48,292
the chronicles of battle?

601
01:27:48,959 --> 01:27:50,751
Where have they gone?

602
01:28:08,709 --> 01:28:09,709
You dreamed.

603
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,584
Tell me what you dreamed.

604
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:25,251
I didn't.

605
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,709
You're lying.
You saw the eyes of the jaguar.

606
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,917
I said I didn't dream!

607
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:41,501
You're afraid.

608
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:44,334
But you must listen.

609
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,667
I'm not afraid to dream.

610
01:28:53,209 --> 01:28:56,084
I'm afraid to die in this hellhole.

611
01:28:56,959 --> 01:28:59,959
You're messing with my head
with your dreams

612
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:02,626
and your prohibitions.

613
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:28,876
Stop. You can't fish.
There's no permission.

614
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:31,334
Permission from whom?

615
01:29:32,084 --> 01:29:33,251
Yours?

616
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,709
The Owner of the Fishes?

617
01:29:36,209 --> 01:29:40,292
I'm sick because of respecting
your ridiculous prohibitions!

618
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,834
Easy, Theo, you're delirious.

619
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:46,042
Let me go!

620
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,709
You want to kill me too?

621
01:29:52,209 --> 01:29:53,876
Drop the arrow.

622
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,584
This river is full of fish!

623
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:02,459
We cannot possibly end them!

624
01:30:34,001 --> 01:30:35,834
How can you help him?

625
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:39,376
Have you forgotten what they did to you?

626
01:30:39,459 --> 01:30:41,792
It wasn't him.

627
01:30:41,876 --> 01:30:44,042
He paid off my debt in the plantation.

628
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:46,709
Then you became his slave.

629
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:50,167
I ain't nobody's slave.

630
01:30:50,251 --> 01:30:53,417
I'm with him because we need him.
He can teach the whites.

631
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:56,667
How can he learn
if he doesn't respect the jungle?

632
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,084
He's afraid.
But he can learn.

633
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:02,459
He's a hero to his people. They all
admire him and listen to his stories.

634
01:31:02,542 --> 01:31:05,584
If we can't get the whites to learn,
it will be the end of us.

635
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:08,042
The end of everything.

636
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:26,501
Kariauatinga, are you all right?

637
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:47,584
They're like ants.

638
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,334
They'll eat anything, and they die fat.

639
01:32:03,709 --> 01:32:06,751
You have no discipline!

640
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:10,042
You'll devour everything!

641
01:32:18,084 --> 01:32:19,584
How is he?

642
01:32:22,459 --> 01:32:23,626
Better.

643
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:26,501
Give him the Sun's semen.

644
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,834
You have to help him!
You can't keep this resentment!

645
01:32:32,001 --> 01:32:36,251
His body's dirty again.
It would be like giving him poison.

646
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:41,792
We have to arrive with my people soon.

647
01:32:41,876 --> 01:32:44,876
We have to talk to yakruna.
Ask it to forgive him.

648
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:48,292
We are so close.

649
01:32:49,126 --> 01:32:52,042
You'll feel better tomorrow. Eat.

650
01:34:03,417 --> 01:34:05,126
It's here.

651
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:08,417
To the left.

652
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:52,959
Freeze!

653
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:54,542
Colombian?

654
01:35:57,876 --> 01:35:59,667
Stop! Freeze!

655
01:36:04,209 --> 01:36:06,084
Are you Colombians?

656
01:36:07,042 --> 01:36:08,376
I don't know.

657
01:36:08,876 --> 01:36:10,876
Get out of here!

658
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:34,376
Sirgú is here.

659
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:48,709
Have a drink of yakruna.
We're toasting to the end of the world!

660
01:37:03,542 --> 01:37:05,709
How can you allow this?

661
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:07,834
Why?

662
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:57,126
Yakruna must not be cultivated...

663
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,876
I misunderstood the signs.
They were clear.

664
01:38:04,792 --> 01:38:06,459
You're the one with the mandate!

665
01:38:06,876 --> 01:38:09,376
- You are the snake!
- Calm down!

666
01:38:10,876 --> 01:38:12,792
Give it back to me!

667
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,042
You're not worthy of this!

668
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:22,001
You bring hell and death to earth!

669
01:38:31,626 --> 01:38:33,626
The Colombians are coming!

670
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:54,334
This is yakruna!

671
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:57,959
The greatest knowledge
of what my people once were!

672
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:00,459
I won't let you take it away.

673
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:02,751
Never!

674
01:39:11,376 --> 01:39:13,709
The Colombians are coming!

675
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,584
What story is it telling?

676
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:50,126
How God created the world.

677
01:43:51,084 --> 01:43:54,459
This is the way you seek. Listen to it.

678
01:43:55,709 --> 01:44:00,126
It's beautiful,

679
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:02,209
but it is only a story.

680
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:03,959
It's not a story.

681
01:44:04,834 --> 01:44:07,459
It's a dream. You must follow it.

682
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:10,792
I am a man of science.
Of real, palpable facts.

683
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:14,834
I can't be guided
by dreams that I don't have.

684
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:17,542
You do follow them.

685
01:44:19,917 --> 01:44:22,042
How many edges does this river have?

686
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:24,792
Two.

687
01:44:24,876 --> 01:44:26,292
How do you know that?

688
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:30,792
There's one, and there's another.

689
01:44:32,084 --> 01:44:34,084
One plus one equals two.

690
01:44:34,584 --> 01:44:36,251
How can you know that?

691
01:44:39,959 --> 01:44:43,876
Because! One plus one equals two.

692
01:44:44,834 --> 01:44:48,334
Well, you're wrong. This river
has three, five, a thousand edges.

693
01:44:48,667 --> 01:44:52,626
A child can understand that easily, but
not you. The river's the anaconda's son.

694
01:44:54,292 --> 01:44:57,042
We learn that in our dreams,
but it's the real truth,

695
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,001
more real than what you call reality.

696
01:45:22,584 --> 01:45:24,751
What do you see?

697
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:29,667
The world is like this, huge.

698
01:45:30,126 --> 01:45:32,376
But you choose to see just this.

699
01:45:33,001 --> 01:45:36,209
The world speaks.
I can only listen.

700
01:45:36,751 --> 01:45:39,376
Hear the song of your ancestors.

701
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,334
This is the way you're looking for.

702
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:43,876
Listen for real.

703
01:45:44,292 --> 01:45:47,292
Not only with your ears.

704
01:46:05,334 --> 01:46:07,084
Can I have some?

705
01:46:08,626 --> 01:46:11,876
You're not having anything
until you decide to listen.

706
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:18,042
Can I have some caapi?

707
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:25,251
Caapi won't help you
if you don't want to believe.

708
01:46:33,001 --> 01:46:34,542
You can help me.

709
01:46:37,584 --> 01:46:39,834
This is all I can do.

710
01:47:06,417 --> 01:47:08,792
Which way?

711
01:47:15,709 --> 01:47:17,126
How do you know?

712
01:47:19,126 --> 01:47:20,459
I know...

713
01:47:24,001 --> 01:47:25,376
I believe...

714
01:48:09,584 --> 01:48:11,417
Is that the Workshop of the Gods?

715
01:48:14,792 --> 01:48:16,792
This is where we had to come.

716
01:49:57,417 --> 01:49:58,876
Look!

717
01:50:17,417 --> 01:50:19,084
It is ready.

718
01:50:20,584 --> 01:50:22,417
What are you doing?

719
01:50:22,917 --> 01:50:25,751
Don't damage it. We have to store it.

720
01:50:25,834 --> 01:50:27,209
No.

721
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:33,501
We have to make it into caapi.

722
01:50:37,709 --> 01:50:42,001
This is the last yakruna plant
in the world.

723
01:50:42,667 --> 01:50:44,876
You have to become one with it.

724
01:50:45,709 --> 01:50:46,959
How do you know that?

725
01:50:47,834 --> 01:50:50,084
I destroyed all the others.

726
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:54,459
It is our last hope,

727
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:58,042
my gift to you.

728
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:02,292
I didn't come here for this.

729
01:51:02,376 --> 01:51:04,001
Yes, you did.

730
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:06,542
No.

731
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:17,084
There's a war out there.

732
01:51:23,084 --> 01:51:26,542
My people need rubber.
High-purity rubber.

733
01:51:29,459 --> 01:51:31,209
I have to take it with me.

734
01:51:31,626 --> 01:51:33,626
Did you lie to me again?

735
01:51:35,126 --> 01:51:39,292
You want to make weapons with yakruna?
You want to turn it into death?

736
01:51:41,167 --> 01:51:42,376
Give it to me.

737
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:05,542
Do it. Do it!

738
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:08,167
I don't care.

739
01:52:08,792 --> 01:52:10,751
It is my duty to die,

740
01:52:11,584 --> 01:52:14,209
but yakruna dies with me.

741
01:52:14,667 --> 01:52:18,376
You are chullachaqui too,
and you will be one forever.

742
01:52:51,251 --> 01:52:53,167
Take off your shirt.

743
01:53:06,167 --> 01:53:07,917
Let me see your back.

744
01:53:23,209 --> 01:53:26,126
This is the Medora caapi.

745
01:53:26,209 --> 01:53:28,834
The most powerful of all.

746
01:53:29,667 --> 01:53:31,876
It existed before creation,

747
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:34,709
before the snake descended.

748
01:53:35,626 --> 01:53:38,709
It will take you to see her.

749
01:53:40,834 --> 01:53:43,626
She is enormous, fearsome.
But you must not fear it.

750
01:53:44,667 --> 01:53:47,834
You must let her embrace you.

751
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:53,209
Her embrace
will take you to ancient places,

752
01:53:55,376 --> 01:54:00,876
where life doesn't exist,
not even its embryo.

753
01:54:18,751 --> 01:54:20,209
Drink.

754
01:54:26,792 --> 01:54:28,792
I... tried to kill you.

755
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:31,209
I don't deserve this.

756
01:54:31,834 --> 01:54:33,709
I killed you too,

757
01:54:35,792 --> 01:54:41,334
before, in time without time,
yesterday, 40 years, maybe 100,

758
01:54:41,834 --> 01:54:43,792
or a million years ago.

759
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:47,834
But you came back.

760
01:54:48,709 --> 01:54:53,459
I wasn't meant to teach my people.
I was meant to teach you.

761
01:55:22,834 --> 01:55:25,334
Give them more than
what they asked for.

762
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:28,084
Give them a song.

763
01:55:28,167 --> 01:55:31,959
Tell them everything you see...
Everything you feel.

764
01:55:32,042 --> 01:55:34,834
Come back a whole man.

765
01:55:47,084 --> 01:55:49,001
You are Cohiuano.

766
01:59:28,251 --> 01:59:30,417
Karamakate!

767
02:00:54,459 --> 02:00:58,126
This film is inspired by
the travel diaries of...

768
02:01:05,209 --> 02:01:08,292
These diaries are the only known
accounts of many Amazonian cultures.

769
02:01:08,376 --> 02:01:11,751
This film is dedicated to all the
peoples whose song we will never know.
