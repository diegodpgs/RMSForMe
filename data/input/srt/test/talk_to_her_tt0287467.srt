1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,626
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,459
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:31,043
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:35,169
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,919
You get scared... They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,920
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:49,046
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:53,338
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:58,464
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:03,715
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, hundsome.

11
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,299
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

12
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,633
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,467
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:28,093
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:30,969
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,851
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,387
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,304
...and start dancing.

19
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,892
- She has her period.
- It's early.

20
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,903
Good evening.

21
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:32,821
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:36,572
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,781
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:43,531
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:47,823
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,782
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,290
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:56,325 --> 00:07:00,784
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:04,409
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,452
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,327
Thanks a lot.

32
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:18,078
- You cut off the intestinal food.
- She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:21,620
- We will try again tomorrow.
- Yes, go now.

34
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,954
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,164
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:42,165
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,833
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,625
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,417
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,810
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:59,168
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:03,043
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,419
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,587
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,296
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:20,629
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,963
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:26,964
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,673
- Nino Valencia...
- Enough!

50
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:33,798
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,549
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:42,091
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:45,265
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,259
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:52,516
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,885
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,969
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,553
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,137
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:12,012
I want to ask you something.

61
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:16,305
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:19,555
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:25,181
I would like to do something
deep.

64
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,474
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:30,733
- The woman has gone crazy!
- She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,984
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,651
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:32,743
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:37,285
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,702
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,328
- Or tell me where to send them.
- Send them at my place.

72
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:50,204
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,246
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:58,455
- Good evening.
- Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,830
- What glass do you prefer?
- A tall one.

76
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:09,748
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,791
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:20,167
- What are you saying?
- Can I talk to you?

79
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:26,709
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,918
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,504
- Who named you Lydia;
- My father.

82
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:49,004
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,588
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,172
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,006
But he died last year.

86
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,382
I am sorry.

87
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,549
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:12,341
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,884
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:20,968
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,802
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:28,719
- This is the impression I have.
- Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,886
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,345
Tell El Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:17,393
- Take me from here!
- What's going on?

96
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:21,269
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:24,769
- Give me the keys.
- The door is open.

98
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,353
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,368
My purse.

100
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,827
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,994
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:15,536
- To which hotel?
- To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,667
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,334
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,834
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,502
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:05,419
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,628
Thanks for everything.

109
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,757
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,258
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,848
Do you wash her?

112
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,098
What do you think?

113
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:29,557
- How was the night?
- normal.

114
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:33,683
- Give it to me. I will do it.
- I am going now.

115
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,267
- Good bye.
- Bye, Matilde.

116
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,851
It's so hot!

117
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,018
- Lets cut her hair.
- short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,144
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:53,436
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:56,561
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:59,228
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,354
- Why me?
- Because you need them.

123
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:06,813
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,688
So hot!

125
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,070
I took something from the
drugstore...

126
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:15,231
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:19,232
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,690
- What's it called?
- Perspirex.

129
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,025
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:36,359
- How are you?
- Naked.

131
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:44,819
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,903
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,487
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,029
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.

135
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,821
- You think I am crazy.
- Why?

136
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,738
- Because I don't want to go home.
- No, I understand.

137
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:05,489
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,031
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:13,615
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,240
So, you are separated.

141
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,991
I am alone.

142
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:23,700
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,411
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,329
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.

145
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,371
Indeed.

146
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,668
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

147
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:30,252
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:33,794
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,378
First they raped the locals.

150
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:40,253
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

151
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:43,962
And I admired them so much!

152
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,088
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:50,255
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

154
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,422
- What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
- Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,381
- How do the bulls look?
- Good, but fat.

156
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,090
- How much do you think?
- Over 500 kilos.

157
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:07,758
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:11,508
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,748
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,667
- How is it?
- Very bad.

161
00:25:47,702 --> 00:25:49,542
It tore her apart.

162
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,216
The father will be happy now!

163
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:56,627
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:02,086
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,419
Don't be upset.

166
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:07,587
What time is it?

167
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,004
It has been four hours.

168
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,338
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:17,886
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:21,714
Yes... I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:25,381
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,971
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:31,590
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,424
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:40,050
- Rest assured for that.
- We have to have faith.

176
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,891
I light some candles...

177
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:47,968
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:51,927
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,892
Not yet.

180
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:59,220
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:04,554
She never took them off.

182
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,890
I will get a vase.

183
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:43,935
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,644
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:52,019
And yet... the way things
stand here...

186
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:57,479
...I don't want to go.

187
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,814
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:26,441
No smoking here.

189
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:31,359
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:36,610
- Or rather, I talked.
- And what did you say?

191
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:40,152
Things that concern me.

192
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,951
Did she tell you anything
about me?

193
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:48,111
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

194
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:53,529
- It's my fault for what happened.
- No, it's my fault.

195
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:03,776
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,819
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:14,903
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,195
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,571
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:27,155
We were in Africa.

201
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:30,704
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:35,989
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:39,698
...and totally naked...

204
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,824
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:48,491
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,367
I hate that woman.

207
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,493
- I haven't seen her for years.
- Even worse.

208
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:00,618
What can I do to make you
forget her?

209
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:03,285
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:37,999
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:43,708
- Is Dr Vega here?
- He is in his office.

212
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,965
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:33,008
- She opened her eyes.
- That gives me the creeps!

214
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:36,466
- And when she yawns?
- I shit myself!

215
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:41,634
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:44,593
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,176
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,261
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:56,386
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:59,845
There is no hope?

221
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:04,887
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:07,221
RESUSCITATION

223
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:11,138
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,687
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

225
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:19,181
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:23,349
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:25,349
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,231
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:31,517
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

230
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,274
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,893
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:44,477
Her brain cell has been
completely destroyed.

233
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:49,811
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:54,812
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:57,694
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,105
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,524
Come in, please.

238
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:33,401
- My name is Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga

239
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,735
This is Alicia.

240
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:43,159
Was it your first night here?

241
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,278
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:48,369
Why these boots?

243
00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:51,946
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:56,696
- They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
- I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:00,489
- I know you.
- From my books?

246
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:06,281
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:12,866
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:19,617
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Caf?Muller".

249
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,367
I have to go.

250
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:27,910
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:31,285
- Maybe another time.
- Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,327
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:38,828
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:07,124
- Should I call Dr Vega;
- Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:25,210
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,169
...I found some
from your visit.

257
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,170
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:38,879
...that never took place.

259
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:42,796
- What about?
- Your sexual orientation.

260
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:49,256
- My sexual orientation?
- yes, your sexuality.

261
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:53,715
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:39:55,882 --> 00:40:00,007
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:04,341
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,092
...I think I look for men,
mostly.

265
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,718
- Is this why you came to see me?
- I can't remember now.

266
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:21,219
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:23,428
Do you have a partner?

268
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:29,220
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,887
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:40,930
Was her father here?

271
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,514
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:48,306
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,557
- What is my orientation?
- And what did you say?

274
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:54,266
- That I like men.
- Really?

275
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:57,433
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:01,183
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,559
- What does he care?
- I am glad I found out.

278
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:09,893
Did he ask the head nurseor you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

279
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:14,019
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:26,437
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

281
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:31,146
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

282
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:34,320
...a chorography
that thrills me.

283
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:38,231
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:41,523
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,523
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:48,691
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:53,733
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

288
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,859
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,860
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:06,985
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:11,194
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:15,112
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:16,535
Very good!

294
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,660
Alicia loved it.

295
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:22,904
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:26,988
the female emerges from
the male.

297
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,447
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:36,490
The beach?

299
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:41,116
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,741
The water?

301
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:46,575
The ethereal.

302
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,867
The ethereal...
the impreceptible, the ghost.

303
00:42:51,826 --> 00:42:56,035
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,452
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,786
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:08,453
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:12,662
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:16,246
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,288
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:30,290
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:33,290
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,792
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,293
- You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
- I will.

314
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,379
Look... We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:12,255
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:20,048
I love this room.

317
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:23,465
I will order everything.

318
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:32,591
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,384
How are you?... Shit down.

320
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:44,433
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:44:44,468 --> 00:44:47,427
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

322
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:52,594
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:55,428
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:59,095
Dancing teacher.

325
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,721
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:05,346
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:08,805
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:20,057
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:56,438
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,688
I am coming, mum.

331
00:46:47,654 --> 00:46:49,904
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

332
00:46:54,238 --> 00:46:58,364
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:04,365
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,039
- Where are you going?
- Home.

335
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:12,539
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:16,825
- Yes, but I am going home.
- Of course... It will do me good.

337
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:20,367
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:23,659
- Do you like dancing?
- Yes, of course

339
00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:26,041
But I don't follow it.

340
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,827
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:32,786
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,120
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:41,954
- Where do you go when you go out?
- I don't.

344
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:44,169
You should go out.

345
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:47,621
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:51,580
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

347
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,789
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:28,586
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,879
Twenty three.

350
00:48:35,837 --> 00:48:39,629
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,505
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:55,090
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,924
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:03,050
- Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
- Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:05,633
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:07,926
Your name?

357
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:29,012
- What do you want?
- I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:40,764
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:51,057
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:49:53,016 --> 00:49:57,350
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:49:57,683 --> 00:50:00,725
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:06,560
I started when I was little.

363
00:50:06,893 --> 00:50:11,435
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:17,020
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:20,853
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:25,271
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:27,813
But those by post.

368
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:31,855
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:35,939
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:39,106
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

371
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:42,774
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,482
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:50,400
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:54,650
- What did your father say?
- Nothing. What could he?

375
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,901
- Is he dead?
- God, no.

376
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,193
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,069
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:11,611
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,987
We are not in touch.

380
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:20,446
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

381
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:24,870
- What's your problem?
- Me? Nothing.

382
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:29,197
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:51:31,906 --> 00:51:34,573
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:40,658
Did you have a sexual
relationship with a woman?

385
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,492
- With a man?
- No, neither.

386
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:50,784
I will see you in a week.

387
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,847
- Am I not well doctor?
- That's not it...

388
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:58,563
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:02,244
- It wasn't special.
- It was. Very special.

390
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:06,620
And we must analyse it in depth.

391
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,829
Yes, lets analyse it.

392
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:16,996
- Should I come in a week?
- Very well.

393
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:19,914
I am glad.

394
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:56,220
- What are you doing here?
- I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,929
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:21,766
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:26,142
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:17,024
Can you be in charge?

399
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:37,444
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:41,612
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

401
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:45,320
It was raining during that
whole week.

402
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:54,905
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,697
What happened to her?

404
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:59,989
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:05,532
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:56:05,615 --> 00:56:08,241
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:13,200
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:18,742
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,868
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,077
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:29,077
Right, Alicia?

412
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,120
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

413
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:40,871
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:44,496
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:56:44,788 --> 00:56:47,955
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:56:49,164 --> 00:56:52,748
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:55,005
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,957
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,332
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:06,833
I can't touch her.

421
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,251
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:16,501
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,342
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:57:20,377 --> 00:57:23,426
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:25,878
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:57:26,128 --> 00:57:28,837
How are you so certain
about this?

427
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,170
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:36,546
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:40,922
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:45,131
...don't foget that she's alive
and that you love her.

431
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:49,423
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:57:51,007 --> 00:57:54,090
And what do you know
about women?

433
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,591
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,266
What do you know about women?

435
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:11,010
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

436
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:17,177
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

437
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:20,226
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:24,553
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,971
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:33,722
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

441
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:40,348
- Is he gay too?
- No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,682
- Is Benigno, you think?
- Rumours say so!

443
00:58:45,015 --> 00:58:48,661
- You are wrong.
- Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:52,210
- And where did he find out?
- From Alicia's father.

445
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:55,860
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:59,476
...but Vega told me not to
worry, becayse he is gay.

447
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:04,101
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:12,061
- She likes Benigno.
- She is not with her senses.

449
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:21,520
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,688
- Are you coming?
- I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:59:24,723 --> 00:59:27,647
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,314
This woman is not well.

453
00:59:32,564 --> 00:59:37,106
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:59:37,815 --> 00:59:40,649
lets see... Here...

455
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:48,066
- Did you talk to her?
- No, and don't insist.

456
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:57,360
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:03,027
Have a good time at work.

458
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,030
'Shrinked lover'.

459
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:36,741
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:43,658
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
01:00:43,693 --> 01:00:46,867
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,830
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
01:01:15,622 --> 01:01:20,581
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
01:01:23,123 --> 01:01:26,213
It was the love story...

465
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:30,791
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

466
01:01:31,624 --> 01:01:35,458
...kai Amparo's friend
who is a scientist.

467
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,417
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,876
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:46,918
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
01:02:14,256 --> 01:02:15,923
I found it!

471
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:27,883
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:02:36,343 --> 01:02:38,885
You still think I act
with selfishness?

473
01:03:11,348 --> 01:03:13,723
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:03:25,558 --> 01:03:29,267
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:39,526
Time was passing by...

476
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,644
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:46,520
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:03:51,312 --> 01:03:53,896
I will always love you.

479
01:03:55,105 --> 01:03:57,737
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:03:57,772 --> 01:04:01,647
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:05,065
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

482
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:09,315
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

483
01:04:09,607 --> 01:04:13,149
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

484
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:16,483
But the most important
thing is...

485
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:21,609
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

486
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:27,235
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:32,069
And goes there.

488
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:21,535
Hotel Youkali.
Room 15.

489
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:52,748
- Sleep, my darling.
- And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,688
And Alfredo...

491
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,148
...stays inside her...

492
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,398
...for ever.

493
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:02,819
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:09:03,903 --> 01:09:08,070
Come on, put your hands
correctly... This way...

495
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:17,113
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:20,655
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

497
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:24,114
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:09:24,906 --> 01:09:27,531
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,532
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

500
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:37,116
What do you think they say?

501
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:40,498
They have no shame.

502
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:44,034
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:49,493
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:10:26,415 --> 01:10:28,797
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:10:28,832 --> 01:10:33,125
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:40,168
Join your hands together...

507
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:44,835
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:52,378
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:56,170
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:10:56,545 --> 01:11:00,337
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:11:00,837 --> 01:11:05,088
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,714
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:14,381
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:11:14,798 --> 01:11:18,632
May your love last eternally.

515
01:11:19,215 --> 01:11:22,591
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:11:22,674 --> 01:11:26,883
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:11:27,175 --> 01:11:30,592
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:33,891
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:37,260
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:39,260
As you wish.

521
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,136
- Nice ceremony, right?
- Excellent.

522
01:11:51,345 --> 01:11:55,513
- I didn't expect her so young.
- You don't trust me right?

523
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:59,972
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:12:00,347 --> 01:12:04,639
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

525
01:12:05,222 --> 01:12:09,265
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,223
- Right.
- And you shouldn't have.

527
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,515
Don't you believe me?

528
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:19,141
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:12:21,392 --> 01:12:24,517
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:27,774
I travelled with Angela.

531
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:31,476
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:36,394
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:41,228
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,770
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:12:45,805 --> 01:12:50,021
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:52,771
Did you still love her?

537
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:58,606
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,773
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:06,774
What a sad story!

540
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:11,024
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

541
01:13:11,059 --> 01:13:13,566
...as the song says.

542
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:16,692
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:21,026
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.

544
01:13:21,776 --> 01:13:23,818
You're right.

545
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:53,656
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

546
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:57,073
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

547
01:13:57,531 --> 01:14:00,907
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:03,449
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:08,533
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:13,867
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:19,535
It was you she cried for.

552
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:26,369
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,668
Last time we spoke.

554
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:34,204
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:37,496
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:39,871
Like at your place.

557
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:20,169
I am alone again.

558
01:15:24,462 --> 01:15:27,052
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:30,296
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:35,297
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:37,880
And Lydia?

562
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:40,922
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:15:42,923 --> 01:15:45,006
Did you break up?

564
01:15:45,965 --> 01:15:48,972
You can call it that way.

565
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:53,133
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:59,425
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:15:59,759 --> 01:16:01,849
When are you going?

568
01:16:01,884 --> 01:16:04,885
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:16:05,176 --> 01:16:07,635
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:16:12,594 --> 01:16:15,678
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:21,762
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:16:23,262 --> 01:16:27,388
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:16:28,763 --> 01:16:31,222
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:47,516
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:52,475
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:16:53,684 --> 01:16:56,059
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:58,983
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:16:59,018 --> 01:17:02,435
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:17:02,935 --> 01:17:06,686
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:17:25,272 --> 01:17:29,023
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:17:30,773 --> 01:17:33,190
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:39,149
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:17:41,149 --> 01:17:43,400
Is there something wrong?

584
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:46,900
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:50,255
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,366
- It's not serious, I hope.
- I don't know.

587
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:57,485
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:17:58,527 --> 01:18:01,659
Brazil...

589
01:18:01,694 --> 01:18:04,028
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:18:04,903 --> 01:18:08,112
- I will read them to Alicia.
- They are guides.

591
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,494
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:14,155
- Are you travelling alone?
- Yes.

593
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:17,613
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:18:17,947 --> 01:18:21,239
- About what?
- loneliness.

595
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:23,781
I want to get married.

596
01:18:26,406 --> 01:18:29,573
- Alicia, of course!
- Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:18:29,608 --> 01:18:32,706
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:36,116
- Why shouldn't I marry her?
- Because she is in a coma!

599
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:41,575
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:18:41,992 --> 01:18:45,701
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:18:45,736 --> 01:18:47,583
Get in the car!

602
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:50,160
- What are you talking about?
- Get in the car!

603
01:18:56,411 --> 01:18:59,995
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:03,954
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:08,538
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:12,497
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,873
Promise!... If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,124
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:26,541
- Regardless of how much you like her...
- You like her too, right?

610
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:28,708
Of course I like her.

611
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:33,229
- She likes you too.
- She is virtually dead!

612
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:37,167
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:39,793
Understand that!

614
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:48,690
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:19:48,725 --> 01:19:52,378
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,545
...which bastard did it!

617
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,969
Everyone is upset.

618
01:19:58,004 --> 01:20:01,838
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,422
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:20:06,047 --> 01:20:08,339
Rosa, please.

621
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:13,465
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,007
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:20:18,215 --> 01:20:21,383
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:20:21,591 --> 01:20:24,716
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:20:24,966 --> 01:20:28,300
I was down with flu
during that week.

626
01:20:29,301 --> 01:20:32,384
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:20:32,634 --> 01:20:35,802
- It is your typewriting.
- Yes, it was me.

628
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:38,969
Why did you lie?

629
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,017
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:45,636
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

631
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:51,054
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:20:51,262 --> 01:20:54,596
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:56,895
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:20:56,930 --> 01:21:01,305
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:04,223
And who replaces her?

636
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:11,057
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:14,349
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:16,683
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:23,642
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:21:24,559 --> 01:21:27,733
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:21:27,768 --> 01:21:32,144
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:21:32,394 --> 01:21:34,352
Definitely not!

643
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,819
Last night I was
at the parkin lot...

644
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:46,813
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:21:46,938 --> 01:21:50,438
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:21:50,855 --> 01:21:54,814
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:21:57,731 --> 01:22:00,155
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:03,648
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:22:05,815 --> 01:22:09,441
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:22:25,819 --> 01:22:29,903
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:36,570
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:42,342
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:22:42,377 --> 01:22:44,947
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:22:46,072 --> 01:22:48,405
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

655
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,405
- And sister Rosa Lazaga;
- Who are you?

656
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,031
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I will put you through.

657
01:22:58,532 --> 01:23:01,616
- Who is it?
- Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:23:02,533 --> 01:23:05,700
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:23:05,735 --> 01:23:08,242
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:23:08,909 --> 01:23:11,367
You should have called me.

661
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:15,326
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:23:15,576 --> 01:23:18,827
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:22,452
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:23:25,411 --> 01:23:29,203
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,913
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

666
01:23:34,948 --> 01:23:37,003
Did you go see him?

667
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:39,955
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:23:40,205 --> 01:23:43,497
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:23:43,706 --> 01:23:47,206
- What prison is he in?
- In Zegovia.

670
01:24:38,089 --> 01:24:40,714
Wait for me here.

671
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:59,634
- I want to see a prisoner.
- In the visting section.

672
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:02,176
Through this door,on the left.

673
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,560
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:25:16,595 --> 01:25:19,721
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:21,929
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:25,561
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:25:25,596 --> 01:25:29,555
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

678
01:25:30,055 --> 01:25:33,306
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

679
01:25:33,723 --> 01:25:37,098
- Are you a relative?
- A friend.

680
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:41,057
- Marco Zuloaga is my name.
- Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:47,892
- Can I call him?
- He will call you.

682
01:25:48,183 --> 01:25:51,809
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:03,192
And remember.

684
01:26:03,227 --> 01:26:06,644
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:26:06,978 --> 01:26:10,937
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:14,479
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:20,147
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:26:21,188 --> 01:26:25,647
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:04,945
Marco, is that you?

690
01:27:05,862 --> 01:27:10,238
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:27:12,696 --> 01:27:15,030
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinique.

692
01:27:17,197 --> 01:27:21,281
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:27:21,948 --> 01:27:25,198
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:29,616
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:33,366
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:27:33,401 --> 01:27:35,700
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:38,242
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:27:38,367 --> 01:27:41,263
- I don't believe this.
- Neither do I.

699
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:44,160
But I am not surpised they
won't tell us.

700
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:48,035
- Are you still my friend?
- Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:27:48,244 --> 01:27:50,536
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:27:50,952 --> 01:27:54,369
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:27:54,578 --> 01:27:58,412
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:28:00,954 --> 01:28:05,580
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:11,330
- Did you find out anything?
- I will. Be patient.

706
01:28:11,664 --> 01:28:16,998
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:20,082
You must wait.

708
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:30,667
- What do you do during the day here?
- I work in the recovery room.

709
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:36,043
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

710
01:28:36,668 --> 01:28:40,168
- It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
- The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:28:40,627 --> 01:28:43,627
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:28:44,336 --> 01:28:48,461
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

713
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,879
This is good for the trail, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:28:56,296 --> 01:29:00,338
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:05,214
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:07,714
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:29:07,749 --> 01:29:09,715
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:29:10,923 --> 01:29:15,299
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:29:17,924 --> 01:29:22,133
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:29:22,592 --> 01:29:25,863
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:29:25,898 --> 01:29:29,134
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:29:29,926 --> 01:29:34,010
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

723
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:38,302
- Why during the nights?
- Because I study during the nights.

724
01:29:38,552 --> 01:29:41,344
I read all your guides.

725
01:29:41,511 --> 01:29:45,220
Like travelling with you
next to me...

726
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,720
...telling me things.

727
01:29:48,012 --> 01:29:51,179
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:53,763
I became one with those people...

729
01:29:53,846 --> 01:29:57,014
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:29:58,014 --> 01:30:01,181
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:04,348
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:30:04,383 --> 01:30:06,473
...waiting in vain...

733
01:30:06,973 --> 01:30:10,182
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:30:10,807 --> 01:30:13,891
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:30:32,644 --> 01:30:35,936
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:39,312
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:30:39,687 --> 01:30:44,521
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

738
01:30:45,354 --> 01:30:49,772
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:30:51,272 --> 01:30:55,398
- And I didn't want any money...
- It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:30:55,689 --> 01:30:59,482
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:08,316
Did you see him?

742
01:31:09,441 --> 01:31:12,317
- How is he?
- Well.

743
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:17,651
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:19,908
No publicity!

745
01:31:19,943 --> 01:31:24,235
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:28,028
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:31:28,063 --> 01:31:30,195
I would give them an interview!

748
01:31:30,445 --> 01:31:33,070
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,237
You are right.

750
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:37,862
The keys...

751
01:31:38,446 --> 01:31:43,030
Anyway... Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,781
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:31:48,364 --> 01:31:51,448
- Benigno is innocent.
- Yes, I know.

754
01:31:51,698 --> 01:31:54,740
- Innocent about what?
- I don't know.

755
01:31:55,115 --> 01:31:58,366
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:07,075
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:34:05,427 --> 01:34:09,386
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:34:11,928 --> 01:34:14,803
- How did the exercise go today?
- Very well.

759
01:34:14,838 --> 01:34:17,019
- Were you tired?
- A lot.

760
01:34:17,054 --> 01:34:20,679
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:24,763
We will do some stretches.

762
01:34:25,097 --> 01:34:28,931
- But I already did 100.
- We'll do a few more.

763
01:35:05,978 --> 01:35:08,770
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:35:13,271 --> 01:35:16,230
The boy was born dead.

765
01:35:16,355 --> 01:35:19,626
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:35:19,661 --> 01:35:22,897
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:35:23,356 --> 01:35:27,190
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:31,239
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:34,941
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:35:35,149 --> 01:35:38,073
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:35:38,108 --> 01:35:42,900
- Can he bail out?
- Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:36:11,572 --> 01:36:14,329
- You are wet.
- A little.

773
01:36:14,364 --> 01:36:19,198
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:34,784
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:40,076
Dld you see the new lawyer?

776
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:47,077
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:36:49,494 --> 01:36:53,161
- I will loose, right?
- Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:36:53,196 --> 01:36:56,829
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:36:57,287 --> 01:37:01,579
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:37:03,371 --> 01:37:05,663
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:37:09,581 --> 01:37:13,206
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

782
01:37:14,706 --> 01:37:18,415
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:20,541
I tried.

784
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:25,166
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:29,542
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:34,293
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:37:34,626 --> 01:37:38,252
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:38:33,552 --> 01:38:35,469
Message!

789
01:38:39,595 --> 01:38:43,512
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:38:44,387 --> 01:38:47,241
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:50,096
...or they will put me
somewhere else

792
01:38:50,388 --> 01:38:53,103
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

793
01:38:53,138 --> 01:38:56,931
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:38:57,556 --> 01:38:59,973
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:39:00,264 --> 01:39:04,140
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:39:04,307 --> 01:39:06,932
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:39:24,768 --> 01:39:27,810
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:39:47,897 --> 01:39:51,356
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:39:51,647 --> 01:39:54,731
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:58,190
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,899
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:40:01,357 --> 01:40:03,983
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,026
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:40:27,653 --> 01:40:30,070
Wait, don't run.

805
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:38,238
In there at the end.

806
01:40:39,738 --> 01:40:42,947
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:40:43,614 --> 01:40:47,031
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:40:54,532 --> 01:40:56,789
Dear Marco...

809
01:40:56,824 --> 01:41:00,950
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:41:02,325 --> 01:41:06,034
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:41:06,534 --> 01:41:10,284
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

812
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,035
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:16,327
...and to be near her.

814
01:41:17,077 --> 01:41:19,661
You are my only friend.

815
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:24,078
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:41:25,995 --> 01:41:30,496
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:41:31,079 --> 01:41:34,955
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:41:35,788 --> 01:41:38,081
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,917
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:42:08,835 --> 01:42:11,211
You must sign here.

821
01:42:20,629 --> 01:42:22,837
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,922
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:42:33,672 --> 01:42:38,006
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:42:38,257 --> 01:42:40,799
...but it was too late.

825
01:42:40,924 --> 01:42:44,507
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

826
01:42:46,549 --> 01:42:49,217
And a photo of hers.

827
01:42:50,008 --> 01:42:53,134
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:42:54,009 --> 01:42:57,426
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

829
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:26,232
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:44:26,565 --> 01:44:28,274
I will bring some water.

831
01:44:57,570 --> 01:44:59,570
Are you ok?

832
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:04,571
I don't know...

833
01:45:07,071 --> 01:45:09,530
I am much better now.

834
01:45:22,824 --> 01:45:25,366
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:32,659
You tremble.

836
01:45:34,325 --> 01:45:35,867
Why?

837
01:45:47,244 --> 01:45:49,703
- What did you tell her?
- Noting.

838
01:45:49,738 --> 01:45:51,752
I saw you talking.

839
01:45:51,787 --> 01:45:55,287
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

840
01:45:57,204 --> 01:46:01,830
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,539
In Benigno's place?

842
01:46:06,164 --> 01:46:09,706
- Why do you stay there?
- Benigno is dead.

843
01:46:14,957 --> 01:46:18,249
One day, we should talk.

844
01:46:18,582 --> 01:46:22,166
Yes, and it will be simpler
than you thought.

845
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,583
Nothing is simple.

846
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,209
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple.
and nothing is simple.
