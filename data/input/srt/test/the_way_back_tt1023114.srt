1
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,975
Look at those poor men.

2
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,559
They've got night blindness.

3
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,645
I saw it in the transit camp.

4
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,651
It's vitamin deficiency from starvation.

5
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,681
Here, here.

6
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,141
You planning on surviving
on half rations, son?

7
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,266
Look, he's an old man.

8
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,893
I'm an old man.

9
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:13,441
I'll be alive in the morning.
He won't.

10
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,527
Kindness.

11
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,404
That can kill you here.

12
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,616
He's American.

13
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,292
In Here? How?

14
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:33,290
Stalin hates foreigners,

15
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,838
and that includes Poles.

16
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:37,503
You're Polish, no?

17
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,670
Uh-huh.

18
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,634
I like you Poles.

19
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,464
Your burning sense of injustice,

20
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,140
the yearning for freedom.

21
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:49,640
Khabarov-- Andrei Timofeyevich.

22
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,847
Weiszczek-- Janusz.

23
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,691
Your charge, may I ask, Janusz?

24
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,238
58-10.

25
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,030
A spy.

26
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,028
That's what they told me.

27
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,529
Ten years?

28
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,577
No. 20.

29
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,702
58-14. Sabotage. Ten years.

30
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,034
And you were on Soviet side of line,

31
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,710
and they arrest you.
They accuse you of spying.

32
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,171
Torture you, huh?

33
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,714
Did you sign confession?

34
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,208
No.

35
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:22,919
No, I wouldn't sign,

36
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:26,256
so they--they tortured someone else.

37
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:30,060
Forgive me.

38
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,224
I was actor.

39
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,768
Moving pictures.

40
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:38,522
In my last picture,
I played aristocrat.

41
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:40,854
They arrested me when the film
was released.

42
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,405
Why?

43
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,198
It was claimed

44
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:49,746
I was elevating the status
of the old nobility.

45
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,291
So you got ten years
for a performance in a film.

46
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:55,790
I've had better notices.

47
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:11,927
Nyet.

48
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:22,604
The Urki.

49
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,441
Do you know who these are?

50
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:28,117
Professional criminals.

51
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,445
Murderers and thieves.

52
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,451
Don't stare at them.

53
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,954
The guards let them run things in here,

54
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,580
and they are to be feared.

55
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,411
Then why would they
let them run things?

56
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,498
Because they are byproduct of
bourgeois society

57
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:43,584
and so friends of people.

58
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:49,799
We are political prisoners and
so enemies of people.

59
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:53,351
The Soviet Union
has become one vast prison.

60
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,429
Slave labor.

61
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:58,640
They are from far reaches of
Soviet Empire,

62
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:03,024
all caught up in same net.

63
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:06,277
And, uh, do any of them
wriggle out of the net?

64
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,406
No, Janusz. You must be more careful.

65
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,700
Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere,

66
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,285
even in here.

67
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,291
If you are not more careful,

68
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,543
you will die after one year.

69
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,216
If not literally,

70
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:31,306
then spirit.

71
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:35,055
And how long have you been in here?

72
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:38,889
Eleven months and 29 days.

73
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:17,510
You do for me.

74
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,215
You want me to draw you?

75
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,392
No. Not me.

76
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:38,426
Lice?

77
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,254
Eating me alive.

78
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:43,258
For that I have old folk remedy. Come.

79
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,640
The mine.

80
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,691
They blast at night.

81
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,104
What are you doing?

82
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,448
We must be quick.

83
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,947
Or this will not be
here in the morning.

84
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,370
You're going to
leave it here overnight? Why?

85
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,031
You'll see.

86
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:27,973
It can be done.

87
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:29,679
I know a way through the wire.

88
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,139
How?

89
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:33,099
Lazar, my associate,

90
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,185
he is overseer of construction.

91
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,486
He showed me.

92
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,315
If you ever escape the camps,

93
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:43,443
and I've been waiting
so long for someone like you,

94
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,620
someone with the strength,

95
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,822
the will to see it through.

96
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,828
But to go where?

97
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,001
I mean, we can't go west.

98
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,791
I mean, apart from the Germans,
there's the Soviets.

99
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:58,374
And east,
all Soviet right to the Pacific.

100
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,005
No, no, no, no.

101
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,673
North. Have to be-- have to be south.

102
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:03,470
Correct.

103
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:06,174
But do you know where we are?
I mean, exactly?

104
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:13,102
I beileve we are about 500 kilometers
north of Lake Baikal.

105
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,353
This is the lake.

106
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:16,854
Camp is here.

107
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,694
And the border is here.

108
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:20,859
We could follow the edge
of the lake here.

109
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,736
That runs due south.

110
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,193
Exactly. Then we cross the
Trans-Siberian Railway

111
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,826
to the Mongolian border and freedom.

112
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,577
Spring is already upon us.

113
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,249
We will have to wait till autumn.

114
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:33,542
No. Why wait?

115
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,582
Why?

116
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:38,380
Because it is a thousand kilometers
to the border, maybe more.

117
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:42,002
We need careful planning.
We need to stockpile food.

118
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,587
I've already begun trading, dealing.

119
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,422
You must do the same.

120
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,224
And in autumn,
the weather is more predictable.

121
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:57,191
We can use the new snow
to cover our tracks.

122
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,610
And we bring my friends.

123
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,562
Your friends? You trust them?

124
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,189
Of course.

125
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:06,071
They won't all survive.

126
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,153
But they will die free men.

127
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,706
Free.

128
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,689
That's a really brave man!

129
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,476
First we need big branches!

130
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,521
One on each side
and then one on the back!

131
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,816
Help me, Kazik.

132
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:32,740
These down there,
put it there on the branch.

133
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,317
Yes, yes.

134
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,902
Follow me. We'll both go like this.

135
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,031
What?

136
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:38,408
Good.

137
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,451
Yes.Put it there.

138
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,171
Zoran! Your blanket!

139
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:50,671
For a wind break.

140
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:53,468
Get in. Come on.

141
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,046
Come!

142
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,507
Please come with us! We have shelter!

143
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:15,821
I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz.

144
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:17,534
And he's Kazik.

145
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,610
Horodinsky.

146
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:19,786
They are Polish.

147
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:23,958
Voss. I'm Latvian.

148
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:27,036
It's a League of Nations.

149
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,337
And you are?

150
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,547
Smith.

151
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:32,170
And your first name.

152
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,547
Mister.

153
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:36,299
Mr. Smith.

154
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,800
That's right.

155
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:11,589
Might as well have shot us yesterday.

156
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:15,167
We're for the mines.

157
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:41,445
These collars same as used by
ancient Egyptian people.

158
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,406
Yes, but on their horses, probably.

159
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,283
No. No, no, no. Same for people.

160
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:48,709
How do you know?

161
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,082
I was professor of Egyptology,

162
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:53,789
Leningrad University.

163
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,648
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

164
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,270
I've got to get out of here.

165
00:24:58,365 --> 00:24:59,855
I have to get back.

166
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,987
I have to get back.

167
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:10,950
It can be done.

168
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,410
What can be done?

169
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:13,744
He knows a way through the wire.

170
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:17,752
He has a plan.

171
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:20,175
Shh. Who has a plan?

172
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,841
His name is Khabarov.

173
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:24,387
The actor.

174
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:25,931
Do you know him?

175
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:27,974
He has no intention of escaping.

176
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,054
What do you mean?

177
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,855
He's a liar.

178
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:36,524
He's been here for years.

179
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:38,860
Seeks out new arrivals.

180
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,983
Me, when I first came here.

181
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,862
He just likes to talk about escape.

182
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:45,658
I've known others like him.

183
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,862
Why should I believe you?

184
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:50,242
Nothing is for nothing in the camps.

185
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:54,418
From you he gets your energy,
your spirit.

186
00:25:54,505 --> 00:25:56,666
You feed his dream of escape.

187
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,543
You help keep him alive.

188
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,337
He's nothing but a leech.

189
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:03,714
You are a cold bastard, Mister.

190
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:07,845
I'm still alive, that's all I know.

191
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,221
But I won't be in another six months,

192
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:11,890
and neither will you. Not here.

193
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,311
Not in these mines.

194
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,615
But if you are serious--

195
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:29,571
really serious about
making a run for it--

196
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:33,249
I'm with you.

197
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,371
I thought you were a loner.

198
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,544
It can't be done alone.

199
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:41,749
Besides, you have a--a weakness.

200
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,216
You could be useful to me.

201
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:45,043
And what is that?

202
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,095
Kindness.

203
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,763
If anything happens to me,

204
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,803
I'm counting on you carrying me.

205
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,599
Khabarov.

206
00:26:58,694 --> 00:26:59,729
Khabarov, come.

207
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,855
What?

208
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,106
Come with me. Now.

209
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,232
What is it? What? What?

210
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,312
Come. Look at this.

211
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,739
Look at this.

212
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:08,613
We can go. We can go tonight.

213
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,656
The storm will cover our tracks.

214
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:12,284
No, no, no. What are you talking about?
It's a passing storm!

215
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,576
No, it's enough.

216
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,157
Janusz, that is impossible.

217
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:17,493
We need-- We need detailed preparation,

218
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:19,124
we need plans, we need maps.

219
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:21,296
No, no,
the timing will never be perfect.

220
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,089
Look, they won't expect it now.

221
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,508
Are you crazy?

222
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,426
What about the distances, huh?

223
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:28,754
It's, it's a thousand kilometers,
and we need food.

224
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,339
Plenty of food.

225
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:31,765
But, but we have food. You have food.

226
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:33,342
Look, the American is with us.

227
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:35,143
We've been trading, just like you said.

228
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,478
How long will that last?

229
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,850
Look, I've spent half my life

230
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,147
In the woods and mountains.

231
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:41,976
We can live off the land.

232
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:44,148
You don't understand.
You are too young.

233
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,191
It cannot be done.

234
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:46,317
What else is there?

235
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:47,485
You hear me?

236
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,611
To stay here and die?

237
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,238
It cannot be done.

238
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:52,160
Andrei!
How do we get through that wire?

239
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:54,329
I don't know
what you are talking about.

240
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,369
Your friend Lazar--

241
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,951
I mean, he knows, doesn't he?

242
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:00,661
You told me that.

243
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,101
Piss off now.

244
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:29,823
You can't see, can you?

245
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:34,528
Please don't leave me behind.

246
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,155
Promise me, Andrejs.

247
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,411
I can hold onto
your shoulder by night.

248
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:39,912
I can--I can see shapes.

249
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:42,710
By day I can see just fine.

250
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,382
I won't hold you up.

251
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:50,549
Please don't tell the others.

252
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:54,223
In here, I die.

253
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:21,992
Swiss.

254
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,794
There are no secrets here.

255
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,463
What do you want?

256
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,962
The game goes against me.

257
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:14,086
Small debt, they take fingers.

258
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,797
Big debt, they take head.

259
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:19,094
Me, big debt.

260
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,804
But I never gambie my Wolf.

261
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:24,350
In forest, you need knife,

262
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,978
and I need miracle. Get me out of here.

263
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,266
Come on! Come on!

264
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:53,101
Look! Keep going. Keep going!

265
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:54,527
We must keep going! Get up!

266
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,070
Get up!

267
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:57,898
Activity, or we die right now.

268
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,234
You know how fast the dogs are.

269
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,951
Run, damn you!

270
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,405
Mister, come on, look at me.

271
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,740
Is it time for me to carry you?

272
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:09,038
Come on. Come on.

273
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:10,494
Come on!

274
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:17,592
Janusz, we can't see anything!

275
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,546
The snow is blinding us!

276
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,301
Janusz!

277
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,353
I need your knife!

278
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,943
Give me the knife!

279
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,861
Your knife!

280
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:51,288
Janusz, we must take shelter!

281
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,661
We can't go on!

282
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,793
Don't you see? This is perfect!

283
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:57,465
They'll never find us like this.

284
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:58,709
Never!

285
00:33:29,668 --> 00:33:33,286
You stare at me like snake at rabbit.

286
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,496
He teach me English.

287
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:37,998
Speak good, huh?

288
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:43,383
Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy?

289
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:45,384
How far have we come?

290
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:49,013
Maybe 20, 30 kilometers.

291
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:50,560
That's all?

292
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,638
Less, if we've been going in circles

293
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,563
like chicken without head.

294
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,985
All right, let's see what we have.

295
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:01,988
Everyone, come on.

296
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:05,909
We share everything.

297
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,532
And you?

298
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:08,657
What?

299
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,363
Do you have?

300
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:18,918
And that coat.

301
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,374
It's not your coat.

302
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,504
That is Khabarov's coat.

303
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:25,838
Yes, he gave me.

304
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:26,967
And...

305
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,896
Huh? Huh?

306
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:37,064
See?

307
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,106
He was going to inform.

308
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:47,068
Don't worry. I talk to him.

309
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,488
Everything okay.

310
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,918
You've made a bargain with the devil.

311
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:02,249
You realize that?

312
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,750
Do you have a knife?

313
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:14,428
For direction he uses grass
and the mosses. What's that?

314
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,555
I swear to God
he better know what he's doing.

315
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,811
You should be grateful
you're here at all.

316
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:20,767
Grateful is for dogs.

317
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,615
What-- What's that?

318
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:34,288
Woives. It's only wolves.

319
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,032
Only wolves.

320
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,519
South.

321
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,021
To Lake Baikal.

322
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,360
You are the Pakhan.

323
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:54,490
Am I?

324
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,697
What is a Pakhan?

325
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,541
Boss of Urki.

326
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:01,834
We are not criminals.

327
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,207
We are escaping from criminals.

328
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:05,705
I have been watching you.

329
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,542
And I swear to God you win my respect

330
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:10,718
with your sticks and pine cones.

331
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:14,218
I'll come between you and death.

332
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,511
So you want to be my bodyguard?

333
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,093
It's the Urka way.

334
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:22,101
You have me, and you have the Wolf.

335
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,057
Huh?

336
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:26,564
Janusz,
how long till we get to the lake?

337
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:27,731
How long?

338
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,604
Three, four weeks.

339
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,485
Maybe more.

340
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,751
I have us here somewhere.

341
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,747
And down here,
the Trans-Siberian Railway,

342
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,082
and the border of Mongolia.

343
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:52,298
Mongolia seems so far away.

344
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:55,096
Mongolia? I go more.

345
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:58,425
To America.

346
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,435
It's like this--
we have food for another week.

347
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:04,935
We have no more matches.

348
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:08,063
But still we have Khabarov's flint.

349
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:09,610
We need meat.

350
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:11,775
I can make traps.

351
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:14,274
We'll be moving
too fast to wait for traps.

352
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,827
We find farms,
villages, get food there.

353
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:20,121
Look, there's a bounty on our heads.
Remember that.

354
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,915
We steal it. At night.
They never know.

355
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,458
We are not thieves.

356
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:27,295
Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat.

357
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:28,462
You can watch.

358
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,581
What is that?

359
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:30,882
Barbed wire.

360
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,800
He's making a fish-hook.

361
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:34,260
That's how we will survive.

362
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:35,132
With fish?

363
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
Uh.

364
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,097
But I don't eat fish.

365
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,173
Then you'll die.

366
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,470
Come on,

367
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,977
we need to make a fire.

368
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,474
Come on, lots of wood.

369
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:50,352
It'll be 40 below tonight.

370
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:51,402
Tomasz?

371
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,662
No, no, not too much, not too much.

372
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:23,093
Kazik?

373
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,395
Kazik?

374
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:32,899
He's still out, looking for wood.

375
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,230
He has night blindness.

376
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:38,278
Kazik!

377
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:38,949
Kazik!

378
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,125
Janusz!

379
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,392
Janusz!

380
00:40:58,783 --> 00:41:00,444
Professor.

381
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:02,071
I came from the mine to find you.

382
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:07,162
I thought I was alone.

383
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,959
I've been walking with you
for some time.

384
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,661
I'll--
I'll just sit for a minute.

385
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:30,095
Not far to go.

386
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,070
We made it.

387
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:44,192
We really made it.

388
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:49,664
Isn't that something?

389
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:44,211
Lord, take this
innocent soul into thy keeping.

390
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:49,766
Amen.

391
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:52,138
A free man died here today.

392
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,022
Still, one less mouth to feed.

393
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:03,905
What?

394
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:29,983
They'll find our bones
and your drawings

395
00:44:29,994 --> 00:44:32,110
a hundred years from now

396
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:36,699
and say "Look,
a fine example of Early Gulag Man."

397
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:39,159
Shut up with your jokes.

398
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,001
Go and find food like the others do.

399
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:42,953
You do the shutting up!

400
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,664
Drawing all day
like you're on holiday.

401
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:45,965
I'm sick.

402
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:48,168
I cook. They find food.

403
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:49,342
What do you ever do?

404
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,342
Nothing.

405
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:54,799
But I make you all laugh.

406
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,101
No, not anymore, you don't.

407
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:25,996
So...

408
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:30,586
who will be first?

409
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,261
What do you mean, first?

410
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:34,213
The first to die.

411
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:37,266
I think the artist.

412
00:45:37,353 --> 00:45:40,561
But better if it was him,
the funny man.

413
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:44,228
Why better if it's Zoran?

414
00:45:44,235 --> 00:45:46,897
More soft.

415
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:50,071
More--tender.

416
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:57,029
Mister only catch little fish now.

417
00:45:57,123 --> 00:45:59,034
We must have meat, or we die here.

418
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,366
You're the Pakhan,
you've thought of it.

419
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,166
We all have.

420
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:04,915
That's why you brought extra people,
isn't it?

421
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:05,870
For food?

422
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,751
No, no, no.

423
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:09,423
We will get more food
when we get to Lake Baikal.

424
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:11,292
There will be plenty of fish there.

425
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:15,221
You said we would have
seen lake a week ago.

426
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:17,594
Huh?

427
00:46:17,602 --> 00:46:20,639
We're lost, Pakhan.

428
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:12,478
Raah!

429
00:47:12,573 --> 00:47:14,438
Yaah!

430
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:19,986
Yaah!

431
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:22,413
Yaah!
Yaah!

432
00:47:51,362 --> 00:47:54,229
Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake,

433
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:57,190
I will be back in a week.

434
00:47:57,284 --> 00:48:03,245
If I don't, well, you're on your own.

435
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,368
I know.

436
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:10,540
Our friend Valka.

437
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:12,789
Don't let him out of your sight.

438
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,676
Here.

439
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:22,761
Fresh this morning.

440
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:27,098
Thank you.

441
00:48:28,774 --> 00:48:29,809
Good luck.

442
00:48:33,362 --> 00:48:35,944
And you.

443
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,430
Janusz!

444
00:50:27,518 --> 00:50:29,383
I saw it. I saw it.

445
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:30,809
I saw the Lake.

446
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:31,976
Easy, easy.

447
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:33,474
Three days from here.

448
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:35,227
Stones! Gather stones!

449
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:36,773
Heat them in the fire!

450
00:51:24,325 --> 00:51:25,781
What is it?

451
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:28,867
Psst. Psst.

452
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:32,321
Pssst. Hey.

453
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:38,376
Someone's been following us.

454
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:42,082
He's behind that dark clump of trees.

455
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:43,586
If he gives us away,

456
00:51:43,677 --> 00:51:46,544
they'll be all over us in no time.

457
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,472
He's right. We have to do this.

458
00:51:49,558 --> 00:51:50,593
No killing.

459
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:51,932
No?

460
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:53,725
I think you've killed before.

461
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:57,771
You say too many prayers for
an innocent man.

462
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:59,390
Valka, you go behind

463
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:01,350
in case he makes a run for it. Go.

464
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,151
Spread out, spread out.

465
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:22,087
Valka, no.

466
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:23,414
No!

467
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,309
We--we won't hurt you.

468
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:49,648
Huh.

469
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:50,949
A Polka.

470
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,651
Polka? What does he want?

471
00:52:52,746 --> 00:52:54,031
I don't know. It's a girl.

472
00:52:54,123 --> 00:52:55,988
And she's Polish.

473
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,744
She's been following us
for several days.

474
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,416
And what?

475
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:01,164
Well, she needs food,
you know, protection.

476
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:03,291
She's been too afraid to approach us

477
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,668
until she was sure we weren't Russian.

478
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:07,132
She wants to travel with us?

479
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,380
She's on the run, like us.

480
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:11,678
She'll slow us down.

481
00:53:11,765 --> 00:53:14,051
She said she's escaped

482
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:16,225
from a Russian collective farm.

483
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:20,146
I know this type-- street gypsies.

484
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:23,315
There are thousands like that,
less use than a dog!

485
00:53:23,402 --> 00:53:27,896
Pakhan, don't do this. Huh?

486
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,696
Oh, come on. She's starving.

487
00:53:29,783 --> 00:53:31,694
We can barely feed ourselves.

488
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:33,317
Yeah,
maybe it's kinder to leave her.

489
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,494
No, she was sent to us.
We can't leave her.

490
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:39,199
Janusz, we have no choice.

491
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,725
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

492
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,981
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

493
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:16,406
Stay back.

494
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:18,033
Stay back. Careful of the mud.

495
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,332
Easy. Easy. Easy.

496
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:26,954
Valka.

497
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:28,880
Here you are.

498
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:54,318
Find some wood.

499
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,878
Her name is Irena.

500
00:55:47,629 --> 00:55:48,960
Is the soap ready?

501
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,287
Yes.

502
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:51,792
Ah, good.

503
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:53,420
Stir.

504
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,016
Well?

505
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,640
What's so funny?

506
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:11,316
Are you--

507
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:13,564
you are going to the office
this morning?

508
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:35,041
Valka?

509
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:36,170
Valka.

510
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:37,376
Come on.

511
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:38,802
You're next. Go, go.

512
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:41,471
Valka, come on!

513
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,064
Now take off your shirt.

514
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,436
Why do we do this?

515
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:59,740
So we don't look like
thieves and robbers.

516
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:02,359
Head up.

517
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,447
Now, still.

518
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,247
Very still, please.

519
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:12,703
Head up.

520
00:57:14,132 --> 00:57:15,292
More.

521
00:57:18,053 --> 00:57:19,668
Nyet.

522
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:07,137
You know, I, uh,
can't beiieve she's Polish.

523
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:09,180
She's, uh, she's educated.

524
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:11,307
Speaks good English, French.

525
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:12,979
Is that right?

526
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,977
You don't like her, do you?

527
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:16,649
Speak to Valka about her.

528
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:18,564
He doesn't even think she's Polish.

529
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:19,861
Well, I did speak to him.

530
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:21,609
And the others.

531
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,156
They agree she comes with us.

532
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,657
What, you disagree?

533
00:58:27,664 --> 00:58:30,781
There's no room for sentimentality,
you know that.

534
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:33,743
Apart from food, she'll slow us down.

535
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:04,531
No, it won't take our weight.

536
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:06,358
We'll have to swim across.

537
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,406
Can you swim?

538
00:59:13,502 --> 00:59:14,912
Yes, Mister.

539
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:16,493
You wouldn't lie to me.

540
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:17,828
I'm not lying, Comrade.

541
00:59:17,923 --> 00:59:19,879
And don't call me Comrade.

542
00:59:29,184 --> 00:59:30,219
Irena, no!

543
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,872
Here, come on.

544
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:06,339
Here, take the food.

545
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:18,479
Were your parents arrested with you?

546
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,558
They're dead.

547
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:23,439
We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.

548
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,145
When the Russians came,

549
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,776
they said we were kulaks

550
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:29,153
and exploiting the peasants.

551
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:33,783
My parents were afraid
and hid me in the barn.

552
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,122
I found them later.

553
01:00:43,633 --> 01:00:47,125
I--

554
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:54,137
I found them face-down in the mud.

555
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:59,062
They'd been bashed
and strangled with barbed wire.

556
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:07,813
Later, the Russians caught me

557
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:12,277
and sent me to a collective farm.

558
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,782
They were cruel to me.

559
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:17,489
I ran away.

560
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:19,666
I had no food.

561
01:01:19,753 --> 01:01:21,789
And then I saw you.

562
01:01:30,055 --> 01:01:31,886
You can't swim, can you?

563
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:36,762
What?

564
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,514
You've never been near
the water in your life.

565
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:41,187
But I got across, didn't I?
And you followed.

566
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:44,524
And you said you lived
on a farm near Warsaw?

567
01:01:44,528 --> 01:01:45,813
Yes.

568
01:01:45,904 --> 01:01:47,394
Soviets didn't get that far.

569
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:52,028
That was German territory.

570
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:55,485
Your parents weren't murdered,
were they?

571
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,821
You made all that up.

572
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:04,411
We've all done
terrible things to survives.

573
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:10,629
But don't ever lie to me again.

574
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,590
We've had enough of lies.

575
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:29,277
We have to go around it.

576
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:31,605
Quicker through it.

577
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,565
No, they have dogs.

578
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,072
If they raise the alarm,
then we don't stand a chance.

579
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:37,948
We need food again, Pakhan.

580
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,779
Look, I know we need food,

581
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,207
but we can't go into
that town and risk arrest.

582
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:43,704
We're wasting time.

583
01:03:00,854 --> 01:03:02,765
What is it? What's wrong?

584
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:04,262
Where's Valka?

585
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:05,764
He was behind Zoran.

586
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:07,975
Zoran, weren't you watching him?

587
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:12,153
I'm not his keeper.

588
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,855
Damn him.

589
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,941
He could turn us in for the bounty.

590
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:17,242
And risk arrest?

591
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,615
He's a gambler.

592
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:22,914
Irena,
do you think he would do that?

593
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,207
He might.

594
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:25,659
We don't need his knife.

595
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:27,665
We can make one out of deer bone.

596
01:03:27,756 --> 01:03:29,872
It's an opportunity to get rid of him.

597
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,341
All right, all right.

598
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:36,010
Come on, let's go.

599
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:38,304
Watch it funny man?

600
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:39,798
Hey, hey, hey!

601
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:42,475
You want to get us all killed? Hmm?

602
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,974
Hmm?

603
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:48,314
Easy, cowboy.

604
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:51,188
You tear my coat.

605
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:52,268
Idiot.

606
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:55,822
Idlot? Ha.

607
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:57,240
Am I?

608
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:59,158
Let's see who is idiot.

609
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:05,366
What?

610
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,620
Did I kill?

611
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:09,999
Yes.

612
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,496
A dog.

613
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:14,333
Don't believe me, then don't eat.

614
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:19,217
But you will, won't you,
because you want to survive.

615
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:21,172
I know about survive.

616
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,972
All my life.

617
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,679
And--

618
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:29,522
it's my birthday.

619
01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:33,022
In Russia, that means we drink.

620
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,660
She lived in the streets, like me.

621
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:31,204
So the story you told us wasn't true.

622
01:05:31,296 --> 01:05:33,252
I thought that story would be more sad

623
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:35,125
and you wouldn't leave me behind.

624
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,224
My parents were Polish Communists.

625
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:50,930
They took us to live in Soviet Union,
to Moscow.

626
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,556
They want to work for the Revolution.

627
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:57,936
We lived in the Hotel Lux,

628
01:05:58,031 --> 01:06:01,148
with lots of foreign Communists.

629
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:07,784
But they arrested them in 1937.

630
01:06:07,874 --> 01:06:09,330
They said they were spies.

631
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,127
The people pot me in the orphanage.

632
01:06:15,215 --> 01:06:16,751
And my brother,

633
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:18,923
he died.

634
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,001
I was ten years old.

635
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:28,516
They called me Rykov,

636
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:36,601
but I remembered our Polish name--
Zielinska.

637
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:42,815
I used to say it every night
before I went to sleep.

638
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,194
So you ran away.

639
01:06:48,623 --> 01:06:49,738
Oh.

640
01:07:20,321 --> 01:07:21,902
They have no mosquitoes.

641
01:07:26,536 --> 01:07:28,151
What can we do?

642
01:07:28,246 --> 01:07:29,986
Steal a boat?

643
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:31,696
No, it's too risky.

644
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,907
People are going to get ill.

645
01:07:34,002 --> 01:07:36,038
I know.

646
01:07:36,129 --> 01:07:37,869
Isn't it strange?

647
01:07:37,964 --> 01:07:39,500
After all we've faced,

648
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:42,674
these tiny insects might bring us down.

649
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:55,186
There it is again.

650
01:07:55,273 --> 01:07:56,683
No mosquitoes!

651
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:57,889
Zoran! Zoran!

652
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:05,571
What's he doing, for God's sake?

653
01:08:22,425 --> 01:08:24,040
Mosquito repellent.

654
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:30,468
So what you say to him?

655
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:32,139
Who?

656
01:08:32,227 --> 01:08:33,763
The mosquito man.

657
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:35,593
Ah.

658
01:08:35,605 --> 01:08:36,936
I'm an escaped convict

659
01:08:37,023 --> 01:08:38,308
who is plagued by mosquitoes.

660
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,764
Yeah, very funny.

661
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:41,232
No, really, what did you say?

662
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,025
Come on, man.

663
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:46,066
Clown.

664
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,820
Goodbye, Lake Baikal.

665
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:55,280
Well done.

666
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:07,462
Mister, did you know Voss is a priest?

667
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,169
No, I didn't know that.

668
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:12,347
And Tomasz is a pastry chef,

669
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:13,969
but he wants to be an artist.

670
01:09:13,977 --> 01:09:15,638
You don't say.

671
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:18,936
And Zoran was on business in Moscow,

672
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:20,934
arrested in Red Square.

673
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:23,687
He said he was
just taking a photo of the Kremlin.

674
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:26,315
He's an accountant.

675
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,317
Well, I'll be damned.

676
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:30,315
I never knew a funny accountant.

677
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:35,328
Don't you talk to each other?

678
01:09:35,415 --> 01:09:39,203
In the camps you learn to say
as little as possible.

679
01:09:39,294 --> 01:09:40,875
Mr. Smith?

680
01:09:40,962 --> 01:09:42,953
Working on the Moscow Metro?

681
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,662
He's an engineer.

682
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:46,497
His father was Finnish.

683
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:49,842
Grew up in America,
but he could speak Russian.

684
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:53,342
And why would an American
move to Russia, for God's sake?

685
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:55,010
The Depression.

686
01:09:55,018 --> 01:09:57,350
His son came with him.

687
01:09:57,437 --> 01:10:00,895
What happened to his son?

688
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:02,973
They shot him.

689
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,477
He was 17.

690
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:14,419
The Mongolian border

691
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:16,220
is on the other side of those tracks--

692
01:11:16,307 --> 01:11:17,922
maybe four, five days away.

693
01:11:18,017 --> 01:11:19,928
Can we cross somewhere else?

694
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:21,509
Here, this is the main line.

695
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:23,435
It's going to be like this everywhere.

696
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,272
He's right. We wait till tonight.

697
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,605
What?

698
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:35,155
Nothing. Just looking.

699
01:11:35,243 --> 01:11:36,904
Don't look.

700
01:11:44,877 --> 01:11:46,117
Valka?

701
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:48,203
What?

702
01:11:48,297 --> 01:11:50,583
Why do you have assholes tattooed
on your chest?

703
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:52,631
I mean, they should be on your ass

704
01:11:52,718 --> 01:11:55,130
so you can sit on them
every time you take a shit.

705
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:56,844
You think it's funny?

706
01:11:56,931 --> 01:11:58,671
They are great men.

707
01:12:00,852 --> 01:12:02,683
Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka!

708
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,807
Don't you know what "Stalin" means,
funny man?

709
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:07,684
Means Man-of-Steel.

710
01:12:07,775 --> 01:12:09,811
He takes from rich and gives to poor.

711
01:12:09,902 --> 01:12:12,188
Yes, of course he does.

712
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,316
Then he takes both of them

713
01:12:14,323 --> 01:12:16,279
and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years.

714
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:18,608
Watch your eyes, crow bait.

715
01:12:59,452 --> 01:13:02,194
Thank you, Mother Russia,
for your hospitality,

716
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:04,321
but I will definitely
not be coming back.

717
01:13:33,402 --> 01:13:36,565
You know, they'll-- they'll catch you.

718
01:13:36,656 --> 01:13:39,568
Yeah. Prison is okay.

719
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:41,065
Debt is bad.

720
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,741
But there are many prisons,

721
01:13:42,745 --> 01:13:43,985
they don't find me.

722
01:13:46,832 --> 01:13:49,699
What about America?

723
01:13:49,794 --> 01:13:53,912
Oh. It's not for me, freedom.

724
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:56,668
I wouldn't know what to do with it,
I swear to God.

725
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:06,426
So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me.

726
01:14:06,435 --> 01:14:09,427
You don't need him anymore.

727
01:14:15,361 --> 01:14:18,945
Good luck, Valka.

728
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:20,939
Goodbye, Janusz.

729
01:15:05,286 --> 01:15:07,993
Look. See?

730
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,867
Do you think
we'll get there by tonight?

731
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:12,539
Yes, I think so.

732
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:14,458
What will we do?

733
01:15:14,545 --> 01:15:16,661
We will eat.

734
01:15:16,672 --> 01:15:17,627
Yes.

735
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:19,205
We will sleep.

736
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:25,131
We made it.

737
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,446
Mister!

738
01:15:58,089 --> 01:15:59,829
They're communists.

739
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:06,752
So it's here too.

740
01:16:15,648 --> 01:16:17,934
This changes everything.

741
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:22,184
There's nowhere to hide.

742
01:16:39,213 --> 01:16:40,874
It's a Buddhist temple.

743
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:43,547
They might take us in.

744
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:46,091
They might also be
working with the regime.

745
01:16:46,178 --> 01:16:48,385
It's a risk.

746
01:17:44,612 --> 01:17:47,149
What happened here?

747
01:17:47,156 --> 01:17:49,693
The same as happened in Russia.

748
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,782
Churches closed...

749
01:17:58,876 --> 01:18:03,495
priests shot or taken to camps...

750
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:05,121
religion banned.

751
01:18:08,886 --> 01:18:13,129
They came to my church, in Latvia.

752
01:18:13,224 --> 01:18:15,431
Destroyed everything, much like this.

753
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:24,057
I went back later that night,

754
01:18:24,151 --> 01:18:26,813
and there was a lone-- lone guard.

755
01:18:26,904 --> 01:18:30,647
Just a boy.

756
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:32,527
And I strangled him

757
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:35,576
until his eyes
popped right out of his head.

758
01:18:45,297 --> 01:18:49,210
Valka knew somehow.

759
01:18:49,218 --> 01:18:51,755
He knew I'd killed in cold blood.

760
01:19:01,814 --> 01:19:03,179
How far is China?

761
01:19:03,274 --> 01:19:04,889
I don't know.

762
01:19:04,984 --> 01:19:09,227
Maybe five, six hundred
kilometers due south.

763
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:12,355
600 kilometers?

764
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,689
Is Chlna free?

765
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:14,944
They're fighting the Japs.

766
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:16,150
I know that much.

767
01:19:16,245 --> 01:19:18,110
After China is Tibet.

768
01:19:18,205 --> 01:19:21,038
We could go to Lhasa, the capital.

769
01:19:36,265 --> 01:19:38,381
What?
What are you talking about?

770
01:19:38,475 --> 01:19:40,261
They say we could go beyond Tibet,

771
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:41,888
over the mountains to India.

772
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:42,934
What mountains?

773
01:19:43,022 --> 01:19:44,432
The Himalayas.

774
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:45,979
Join the British Army.

775
01:19:46,066 --> 01:19:47,806
Fight Nazls, then fight the Russians.

776
01:19:47,902 --> 01:19:50,769
Go over the Himalayas?

777
01:19:50,863 --> 01:19:54,481
How? On a magic carpet?

778
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:56,782
How?

779
01:19:56,785 --> 01:19:58,491
We walk.

780
01:20:13,677 --> 01:20:14,666
Careful.

781
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:30,933
Come on, wake up.

782
01:20:31,028 --> 01:20:33,986
I was in the middle
of this beautiful dream.

783
01:20:34,073 --> 01:20:36,485
I was about to eat some salt.

784
01:20:36,575 --> 01:20:38,611
I almost taste it.

785
01:20:38,702 --> 01:20:41,535
I just want to go back to that dream.

786
01:20:41,622 --> 01:20:43,362
It's a very simple recipe.

787
01:20:43,457 --> 01:20:46,290
You just need two sprigs of rosemary

788
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:47,992
and a pinch of nutmeg.

789
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:50,499
Nutmeg? What about the salt?

790
01:20:50,506 --> 01:20:52,542
No, we'll--we'll get to that. Now--

791
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:53,713
add the oil--

792
01:20:53,801 --> 01:20:55,086
Mm-hmm.

793
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:56,508
And you leave it to marinate

794
01:20:56,595 --> 01:20:57,960
while you prepare the chicken.

795
01:20:58,055 --> 01:20:58,794
This is where the salt comes in.

796
01:20:58,889 --> 01:21:00,425
Good.

797
01:21:00,516 --> 01:21:02,177
You rub it into the skin of the chicken

798
01:21:02,184 --> 01:21:03,720
with a little bit of the paprika.

799
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:05,347
But double the salt.

800
01:21:05,437 --> 01:21:06,847
Look,
you cannot just doubie the sait.

801
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:08,395
It'll be too salty then.

802
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:10,188
I don't care, just doubie the sait.

803
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:12,023
I'm not going to ruin it.

804
01:21:12,111 --> 01:21:13,726
Just double the salt, please.

805
01:21:13,821 --> 01:21:15,186
No.

806
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,315
Tomasz--

807
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:17,442
No.

808
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,748
All right, all right.
Everybody keep calm.

809
01:21:28,836 --> 01:21:30,292
Oh, my God!

810
01:21:30,379 --> 01:21:33,542
No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run.

811
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:35,793
Be calm and smile. Be friendly.

812
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:42,596
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

813
01:21:42,683 --> 01:21:44,014
Everybody smile.

814
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:48,265
Hello. Hello.

815
01:23:39,049 --> 01:23:40,505
That's south.

816
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:17,663
Are we going to eat that?

817
01:24:17,754 --> 01:24:20,666
It's either this or fish.

818
01:24:26,597 --> 01:24:28,679
It looks like a bird's nest.

819
01:24:28,765 --> 01:24:31,006
It will protect you from the sun.

820
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:38,271
Irena, try this for your feet.

821
01:25:24,738 --> 01:25:26,444
South.

822
01:25:26,448 --> 01:25:28,439
Come on, we keep going.

823
01:25:45,592 --> 01:25:48,083
No, it's another mirage.

824
01:25:48,178 --> 01:25:49,384
We have no water.

825
01:25:50,931 --> 01:25:52,421
There's trees there.

826
01:25:52,516 --> 01:25:56,304
If there's trees, there--there's water.

827
01:25:56,311 --> 01:25:57,676
No, I don't care.

828
01:25:57,771 --> 01:25:59,636
It's east. We're going south.

829
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:02,268
But, Janusz,
we've got to give it a try.

830
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:04,816
No, no, no. We must keep going south,

831
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,105
or you'll kill us all.

832
01:26:06,196 --> 01:26:07,652
Damn it!

833
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:11,527
Janusz, we're dying.

834
01:26:11,618 --> 01:26:12,949
We're already dying.

835
01:26:13,036 --> 01:26:14,446
Stop.

836
01:26:37,936 --> 01:26:39,597
It's a mirage!

837
01:26:40,814 --> 01:26:42,975
It's just a mirage.

838
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,176
Mirages don't have birds.

839
01:27:21,897 --> 01:27:24,263
Mirages don't have birds!

840
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:36,115
It's a well!

841
01:27:52,803 --> 01:27:55,590
Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick.

842
01:29:29,232 --> 01:29:31,018
At least we have water here.

843
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:32,895
Shh. Shh. You'll wake her.

844
01:29:32,986 --> 01:29:34,851
Yeah, but no food.

845
01:29:34,946 --> 01:29:36,857
Maybe nomads
will come to water their flocks.

846
01:29:36,948 --> 01:29:38,654
When?

847
01:29:38,742 --> 01:29:40,653
Next week, next month?

848
01:29:40,744 --> 01:29:43,486
We should stay here
at least a few more days.

849
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:47,414
Look, without food,
we'll only get weaker.

850
01:29:47,501 --> 01:29:50,368
And then maybe too weak to travel.

851
01:29:50,378 --> 01:29:56,749
I don't know. After these last days--

852
01:29:56,843 --> 01:29:58,925
I don't know if
I can go through that again.

853
01:30:01,264 --> 01:30:03,220
It was a miracle finding this.

854
01:30:03,308 --> 01:30:06,175
Can we count on another?

855
01:30:06,269 --> 01:30:07,384
Janusz?

856
01:30:13,401 --> 01:30:15,266
Okay, give me your best.

857
01:30:21,618 --> 01:30:22,858
Ohh!

858
01:30:22,953 --> 01:30:24,238
Ah, ha ha!

859
01:30:24,329 --> 01:30:26,741
Wait, wait, wait!

860
01:30:26,748 --> 01:30:28,033
Go, Tomasz!

861
01:30:31,086 --> 01:30:32,417
Hat, please.

862
01:30:36,049 --> 01:30:37,539
Lower.

863
01:31:46,536 --> 01:31:48,948
Run! Run!

864
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:51,325
Get back, get back! Take cover!

865
01:31:57,339 --> 01:31:58,624
Behind that dune!

866
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:08,221
Irena! Get down!

867
01:32:10,477 --> 01:32:11,887
Don't be afraid!

868
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,397
Irena.

869
01:32:25,492 --> 01:32:29,576
Irena.

870
01:32:29,663 --> 01:32:33,872
Sun-dried fish.

871
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,243
Thank you.

872
01:32:38,505 --> 01:32:39,711
Here.

873
01:32:52,894 --> 01:32:54,850
Can you find our way back to the well?

874
01:32:54,938 --> 01:32:57,771
It was way off course.

875
01:32:57,857 --> 01:33:00,599
Remember? I mean, way east.

876
01:33:00,694 --> 01:33:02,184
There's no--

877
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:04,519
There's no features in this wasteland.

878
01:33:04,614 --> 01:33:06,900
I could never find it.

879
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:39,475
When I helped my father in the fields

880
01:33:39,566 --> 01:33:41,227
during the hot summers,

881
01:33:41,317 --> 01:33:43,478
we used to suck on
small stones like these.

882
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:45,777
Made us feel less thirsty.

883
01:34:00,044 --> 01:34:01,329
Janusz!

884
01:34:22,275 --> 01:34:23,731
Sunstroke?

885
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:32,820
I'm becoming a nuisance.

886
01:34:34,245 --> 01:34:37,988
No, no, no.

887
01:34:38,082 --> 01:34:40,824
Do they hurt you?

888
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:44,953
No, not at all.

889
01:34:45,048 --> 01:34:48,381
They must be swelling
because I've walked so far.

890
01:34:50,637 --> 01:34:53,549
Don't you think, Mister?

891
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,629
Yes.

892
01:34:57,519 --> 01:34:59,055
You lie back down now.

893
01:34:59,145 --> 01:35:01,010
I'm gonna cover your legs up for you.

894
01:35:21,251 --> 01:35:23,412
Irena, we can stop for a while.

895
01:35:23,503 --> 01:35:26,870
No.

896
01:35:26,965 --> 01:35:28,876
Just suck on this.

897
01:35:48,444 --> 01:35:50,730
No! Please, no! No!

898
01:35:50,738 --> 01:35:54,105
Shh. Shh.

899
01:36:03,626 --> 01:36:06,663
Come on. We've got to keep going.

900
01:36:15,221 --> 01:36:17,257
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

901
01:36:17,348 --> 01:36:20,135
Shh.

902
01:36:20,226 --> 01:36:22,137
My name is Irena Zieilnska.

903
01:36:22,228 --> 01:36:23,513
Shh, shh, shh.

904
01:36:42,415 --> 01:36:44,997
Put me on the ground, Andrejs.

905
01:36:48,463 --> 01:36:50,545
Just lay me on the ground.

906
01:37:57,532 --> 01:37:59,443
It's okay.

907
01:38:47,749 --> 01:38:51,617
Command thine angels to receive her

908
01:38:51,711 --> 01:38:54,248
and to take her to heaven--

909
01:38:54,255 --> 01:38:57,122
her country.

910
01:38:57,216 --> 01:39:02,381
Amen.

911
01:41:25,281 --> 01:41:27,272
I really like this one.

912
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:29,072
When did you do that?

913
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,401
Second night in the Gulag.

914
01:41:31,495 --> 01:41:37,707
Poor Kazik,
always in trouble with his feet.

915
01:41:37,793 --> 01:41:41,251
Who is this?

916
01:41:41,339 --> 01:41:43,125
You.

917
01:41:43,216 --> 01:41:45,923
Looks like my father.

918
01:41:45,927 --> 01:41:47,258
Is that how I look now?

919
01:41:47,345 --> 01:41:48,630
No.

920
01:41:48,721 --> 01:41:51,258
Now, you look worse.

921
01:41:57,271 --> 01:41:59,557
You caught her smile.

922
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:03,232
Look.

923
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:07,278
This is--just a sketch.

924
01:42:07,281 --> 01:42:10,114
But I'll work on it.

925
01:42:10,201 --> 01:42:11,737
I'll do it.

926
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,819
That's really fine work.

927
01:42:14,914 --> 01:42:20,625
You're a great artist, Tomasz.

928
01:42:20,628 --> 01:42:22,334
It's almost like a photography.

929
01:42:22,421 --> 01:42:25,629
It's the shadow.

930
01:42:25,716 --> 01:42:28,048
It's really nice.

931
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:08,627
We have to get to those hills.

932
01:43:08,718 --> 01:43:12,836
Water may be trapped there.

933
01:43:12,847 --> 01:43:16,510
Come on. Come on, get up. Get up.

934
01:43:21,272 --> 01:43:23,137
Mister.

935
01:43:23,232 --> 01:43:26,065
Come on.

936
01:43:26,152 --> 01:43:30,691
Go on without me.

937
01:43:30,698 --> 01:43:32,279
I'm done.

938
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:37,318
Go.

939
01:43:45,379 --> 01:43:48,667
Zoran...

940
01:43:48,758 --> 01:43:52,546
you go to the hills and look for water.

941
01:43:52,553 --> 01:43:54,009
And you wait for us there.

942
01:43:54,096 --> 01:43:55,085
No.

943
01:43:55,181 --> 01:43:56,261
Yes.

944
01:43:56,349 --> 01:43:58,635
We'll catch up.

945
01:44:36,847 --> 01:44:38,132
Did you find water?

946
01:44:38,224 --> 01:44:39,339
No.

947
01:45:18,264 --> 01:45:20,630
Show me.

948
01:45:20,724 --> 01:45:22,931
Please show me.

949
01:45:29,108 --> 01:45:30,564
Where--?

950
01:45:37,491 --> 01:45:38,901
Where are you?

951
01:45:55,885 --> 01:45:56,874
There's--

952
01:45:59,221 --> 01:46:00,336
water!

953
01:46:38,677 --> 01:46:41,168
Zoran.

954
01:46:41,263 --> 01:46:42,673
Around here.

955
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:59,862
Look at that, uh?

956
01:46:59,949 --> 01:47:02,235
What if--if it's poisonous?
How can we eat it?

957
01:47:02,326 --> 01:47:04,362
No, no, no, we cut off its head.

958
01:47:04,453 --> 01:47:06,944
Here. Give me the knife.

959
01:47:07,039 --> 01:47:09,451
Ah, look at that.

960
01:47:32,064 --> 01:47:33,270
Tastes like chicken.

961
01:47:33,357 --> 01:47:35,018
Yeah.

962
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:38,101
A big, black,
poisonous chicken with no legs.

963
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,773
Well, it's not bad.

964
01:47:43,284 --> 01:47:47,653
You know,
Valka talked of eating each other

965
01:47:47,746 --> 01:47:49,282
when we were in Siberia.

966
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,489
He did?

967
01:47:52,585 --> 01:47:53,995
Yes.

968
01:47:54,086 --> 01:47:56,873
And? Would you have eaten me?

969
01:47:56,964 --> 01:47:59,626
Yeah.

970
01:47:59,633 --> 01:48:02,124
Yeah, of course.

971
01:48:02,136 --> 01:48:04,297
I would never have eaten you.

972
01:48:04,305 --> 01:48:05,920
Well, why not?

973
01:48:06,015 --> 01:48:07,551
Too stringy and bitter.

974
01:48:07,641 --> 01:48:09,427
I'd rather eat snake.

975
01:48:37,338 --> 01:48:39,124
Here's some water.

976
01:48:47,598 --> 01:48:49,839
It can kill you, remember?

977
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,181
What?

978
01:48:51,185 --> 01:48:54,018
Kindness.

979
01:48:54,104 --> 01:48:57,187
How long can you survive
on mud and snakes?

980
01:48:58,484 --> 01:49:00,520
Just leave me here.

981
01:49:04,823 --> 01:49:07,155
You can't, can you?

982
01:49:14,792 --> 01:49:16,202
Look, Mister--

983
01:49:16,293 --> 01:49:18,409
What?

984
01:49:18,504 --> 01:49:23,669
You know,
I may not even know your first name,

985
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:25,750
but i, uh--

986
01:49:25,844 --> 01:49:28,335
I know your son's name.

987
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:31,217
Irena told you?

988
01:49:31,308 --> 01:49:32,889
Yes.

989
01:49:37,606 --> 01:49:39,016
Can I say his name?

990
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:43,308
David.

991
01:49:45,531 --> 01:49:50,446
Saying his name won't bring him back.

992
01:49:50,536 --> 01:49:51,901
What are you trying to do,

993
01:49:51,995 --> 01:49:53,075
give me the will to live?

994
01:49:53,163 --> 01:49:54,573
Is that it?

995
01:49:54,581 --> 01:49:56,287
Stop me from giving up?

996
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:58,115
And are you giving up?

997
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:00,701
In the camps,
some saw death as freedom.

998
01:50:00,796 --> 01:50:04,209
Then why didn't you
just kill yourseif?

999
01:50:04,299 --> 01:50:06,711
Survival was a kind of protest.

1000
01:50:06,802 --> 01:50:09,885
Being alive was my punishment.

1001
01:50:09,972 --> 01:50:12,304
Punishment for what?

1002
01:50:12,391 --> 01:50:15,053
I brought David to Russia.

1003
01:50:22,568 --> 01:50:25,981
And now no one can forgive you.

1004
01:50:26,071 --> 01:50:28,403
And you can't forgive yourself.

1005
01:50:31,034 --> 01:50:35,573
Irena told me...

1006
01:50:35,664 --> 01:50:38,280
that they tortured your wife...

1007
01:50:40,544 --> 01:50:43,035
and she informed on you.

1008
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:50,251
Yes.

1009
01:50:50,345 --> 01:50:54,088
They did the same thing to my boy.

1010
01:50:54,183 --> 01:50:57,016
Then they shot him in the head.

1011
01:51:04,026 --> 01:51:05,857
My wife is alive.

1012
01:51:08,572 --> 01:51:10,187
She lived--

1013
01:51:10,282 --> 01:51:16,118
and was released. That much I know.

1014
01:51:16,205 --> 01:51:18,537
But she'll never be able
to forgive herseif

1015
01:51:18,624 --> 01:51:21,331
for what she's done.

1016
01:51:21,335 --> 01:51:24,623
You see, only I can do that.

1017
01:51:24,713 --> 01:51:27,705
She will be torturing herself,
just like you.

1018
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,839
So you see, I have to get back.

1019
01:51:31,929 --> 01:51:35,262
I-have-to-get-back.

1020
01:52:02,459 --> 01:52:04,120
Janusz.

1021
01:52:12,594 --> 01:52:14,585
Pack your things, quick.

1022
01:53:49,149 --> 01:53:50,685
Janusz!

1023
01:54:36,947 --> 01:54:38,357
Do you hear that?

1024
01:54:39,574 --> 01:54:40,654
What is that?

1025
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:23,944
Tibet.

1026
01:56:06,578 --> 01:56:07,909
Lhasa.

1027
01:56:13,794 --> 01:56:15,455
And where is India?

1028
01:56:15,462 --> 01:56:18,249
Mmmm.

1029
01:56:22,177 --> 01:56:23,462
India.

1030
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:02,213
India. Yes.

1031
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:06,839
There is the track to Sikkim,
over the mountains.

1032
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,012
Many people go there.

1033
01:57:09,099 --> 01:57:11,215
Are there villages on the way?

1034
01:57:11,309 --> 01:57:13,345
Small villages, yes.

1035
01:57:13,353 --> 01:57:15,184
They give you food.

1036
01:57:15,272 --> 01:57:17,513
Fuel for fire.

1037
01:57:17,524 --> 01:57:19,936
But you can't go now.

1038
01:57:20,026 --> 01:57:21,436
Why?

1039
01:57:21,528 --> 01:57:25,362
If big snow comes, very difficult.

1040
01:57:25,365 --> 01:57:29,404
You wait until spring.

1041
01:57:29,494 --> 01:57:31,780
This family keep you.

1042
01:57:36,918 --> 01:57:39,660
Well, we can't cross
the mountains in winter.

1043
01:57:39,754 --> 01:57:42,712
He said it was difficult
but not impossible.

1044
01:57:42,716 --> 01:57:44,422
Janusz, it's only three months.

1045
01:57:44,509 --> 01:57:46,875
Look, we can't let go.

1046
01:57:46,887 --> 01:57:48,627
What do you mean?

1047
01:57:48,722 --> 01:57:52,340
If we stop now, then we'll give
In to exhaustion.

1048
01:57:52,434 --> 01:57:54,550
No, it's not giving in.

1049
01:57:54,644 --> 01:57:57,886
We are exhausted.

1050
01:57:57,898 --> 01:58:00,731
I will sleep till
spring like a bear in a cave.

1051
01:58:00,734 --> 01:58:04,067
You can study Buddhism
and become a monk.

1052
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:08,109
But first you must learn
how to like their tea.

1053
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,532
I already like the tea.

1054
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:11,904
Good night.

1055
01:58:15,999 --> 01:58:17,910
What about you, Mister?

1056
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,788
What are you going to do
for three or four months?

1057
01:58:23,506 --> 01:58:25,417
I'm going to Lhasa.

1058
01:58:25,425 --> 01:58:27,381
Our friend has a contact.

1059
01:58:27,469 --> 01:58:29,551
He thinks he can
get me out through China.

1060
01:58:29,638 --> 01:58:34,257
There's a U.S. military mission there.

1061
01:58:34,267 --> 01:58:36,132
Looking out for number one.

1062
01:58:36,228 --> 01:58:38,093
Isn't that what you Americans say?

1063
01:58:38,104 --> 01:58:40,220
Zoran--

1064
01:58:40,315 --> 01:58:41,430
Zoran.

1065
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,430
What?

1066
01:58:42,525 --> 01:58:43,605
We escaped.

1067
01:58:46,529 --> 01:58:48,235
We made it.

1068
01:58:50,492 --> 01:58:51,732
You're right.

1069
01:58:51,826 --> 01:58:53,691
He's right.

1070
01:58:53,787 --> 01:58:57,575
Apart from a few mountains,
we are there.

1071
01:58:57,666 --> 01:58:59,577
We made it.

1072
01:58:59,668 --> 01:59:01,454
Not all of us.

1073
01:59:01,544 --> 01:59:04,707
No, not all of us.

1074
01:59:09,636 --> 01:59:11,627
What are you going to do, Mister?

1075
01:59:11,721 --> 01:59:13,336
When you go back home.

1076
01:59:13,431 --> 01:59:15,012
Home?

1077
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,465
Build Metros?

1078
01:59:16,476 --> 01:59:19,468
Might drift a while.

1079
01:59:19,479 --> 01:59:23,142
I will fight.

1080
01:59:23,233 --> 01:59:28,102
First Germans, then Russians.

1081
01:59:28,196 --> 01:59:29,811
And then?

1082
01:59:29,906 --> 01:59:31,191
Re-build your church?

1083
01:59:31,283 --> 01:59:33,820
No.

1084
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:36,071
I will die fighting.

1085
01:59:39,416 --> 01:59:42,328
I'm going to get Tomasz' pictures to a newspaper

1086
01:59:42,419 --> 01:59:44,876
or get them published somehow.

1087
01:59:44,963 --> 01:59:49,502
And then I'm going to cook his chicken

1088
01:59:49,509 --> 01:59:53,548
but with extra salt,
just--just to annoy him.

1089
01:59:56,308 --> 01:59:59,175
And you, Janusz?

1090
01:59:59,185 --> 02:00:01,346
As long as the communists
are in Poland,

1091
02:00:01,354 --> 02:00:03,140
you cannot go back.

1092
02:00:03,231 --> 02:00:06,894
They'll shoot you, Janusz.

1093
02:00:06,985 --> 02:00:11,854
I'll just, uh--keep going, you know,
until it's over.

1094
02:00:18,788 --> 02:00:20,870
I'll just keep walking.

1095
02:00:37,057 --> 02:00:38,467
He's gone.

1096
02:00:44,564 --> 02:00:46,896
Janusz!

1097
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,436
Janusz!

1098
02:02:17,323 --> 02:02:19,609
Namaste.

1099
02:02:34,799 --> 02:02:37,131
Namaste.

1100
02:02:37,218 --> 02:02:38,503
Welcome to India.

1101
02:02:38,595 --> 02:02:39,835
Paper passport, please.

1102
02:02:39,929 --> 02:02:42,170
Passport.

1103
02:02:42,182 --> 02:02:43,388
We--we--we don't have.

1104
02:02:43,475 --> 02:02:45,511
Never mind. Come with me.

1105
02:02:49,856 --> 02:02:51,187
Where have you come from?

1106
02:02:51,191 --> 02:02:52,351
Siberia.

1107
02:02:52,358 --> 02:02:53,598
Siberia?

1108
02:02:55,987 --> 02:02:57,648
And how did you come, sir?

1109
02:02:57,739 --> 02:02:59,195
We walked.

1110
02:02:59,282 --> 02:03:00,772
Walked?
