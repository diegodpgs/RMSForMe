00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,420
<i>This is a story about a man
named Harold Crick.</i>

2
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,650
<i>And his wristwatch.</i>

3
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,119
<i>Harold Crick was a man of infinite
numbers...</i>

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,990
<i>... endless calculations
and remarkably few words.</i>

5
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,860
<i>And his wristwatch said even less.</i>

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,430
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,070
<i>... Harold would brush
each of his 32 teeth 76 times.</i>

8
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,380
<i>Thirty-eight times back and forth.</i>

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,250
<i>Thirty-eight times up and down.</i>

10
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,140
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

11
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>... Harold would tie his tie in a single
Windsor knot instead of the double...</i>

12
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,650
<i>... thereby saving up to 43 seconds.</i>

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,160
<i>His wristwatch thought the single
Windsor made his neck look fat...</i>

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,010
<i>... but said nothing.</i>

15
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,750
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

16
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,710
<i>... Harold would run at a rate of nearly
57 steps per block for six blocks...</i>

17
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,270
<i>... barely catching
the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
<i>His wristwatch would delight...</i>

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,140
<i>... in the feeling of the crisp wind
rushing over its face.</i>

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,230
<i>And every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

21
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>... Harold would review 7.134
tax files...</i>

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,160
<i>... as a senior agent
for the Internal Revenue Service.</i>

23
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,830
Regs section 1.469-2 (B) (i), Diane.
Thanks.

24
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,410
Good morning. IRS.

25
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,180
Harold, 89 times 1417?

26
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,040
126,113.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,220
That adds up.

28
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,920
<i>Only taking a 45.7- Minute
lunch break...</i>

29
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,320
<i>... and a 4.3- Minute coffee break...</i>

30
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,620
<i>... timed precisely by his wristwatch.</i>

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,230
Oh, great.

32
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,810
Yeah, we'll go to Mullen's or we'II...

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,470
<i>Beyond that,
Harold lived a life of solitude.</i>

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,740
<i>He would walk home alone.</i>

35
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,080
<i>He would eat alone.</i>

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,460
<i>And at precisely 11:13 every night...</i>

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,420
<i>... Harold would go to bed alone...</i>

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,580
<i>... placing his wristwatch to rest
on the nightstand beside him.</i>

39
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,600
<i>That was, of course,
before Wednesday.</i>

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,440
<i>On Wednesday, Harold's wristwatch
changed everything.</i>

41
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,610
Oh, my God, you got it?

42
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,950
I got it.

43
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,850
I got it.

44
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,240
<i>If one had asked Harold,
he would have said...</i>

45
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,240
<i>... that this particular Wednesday was
exactly like all the Wednesdays prior.</i>

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,820
<i>And he began it the same way he...</i>

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,920
<i>And he began it the same way
he always did.</i>

48
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,720
Hello?

49
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,810
<i>He began it the same way
he always did.</i>

50
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,650
<i>When others' minds would...</i>

51
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,230
Hello? Is someone there?

52
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,190
<i>When others' minds would fantasize
about their upcoming day...</i>

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,500
<i>... or even try to grip onto
the final moments of their dreams...</i>

54
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,330
<i>... Harold just counted brushstrokes.</i>

55
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,510
All right, who just said,
"Harold just counted brushstrokes"?

56
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,480
And how do you know I'm counting
brushstrokes?

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,870
Hello?

58
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,280
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,
modest...</i>

59
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,910
<i>It was remarkable h...</i>

60
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,560
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,
modest elements of Harold's life...</i>

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,870
<i>... so often taken for granted...</i>

62
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,340
<i>... would become the catalyst
for an entirely new life.</i>

63
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,310
<i>Harold ran for the bus...</i>

64
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,810
<i>... his stiff leather shoes
making a terrible squeaking sound...</i>

65
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,650
<i>... as they flexed against the asphalt.</i>

66
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,580
<i>And though this was
an extraordinary day...</i>

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,760
<i>... a day to be remembered
for the rest of Harold's life...</i>

68
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,320
<i>... Harold just thought
it was a Wednesday.</i>

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,310
I'm sorry, did you hear that?

70
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,900
The voice. Did you hear it?
"Harold thought it was a Wednesday"?

71
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,820
Don't worry, it is Wednesday.

72
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,560
No, no, did you hear it? "Harold
just thought it was a Wednesday"?

73
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,440
- Who's Harold?
- I'm Harold.

74
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,290
Harold, it's okay, it's Wednesday.

75
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,920
No, no, I...

76
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,080
Never mind.

77
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,290
<i>Harold couldn't concentrate
on his work.</i>

78
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,460
Excuse me, Harold?

79
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,600
<i>His thoughts were scattered.
His mind elsewhere.</i>

80
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,930
Sorry.

81
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,170
Someone here should be able to fix...
Hold on a second.

82
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,430
Hey, Harold. What's 67 times 453?

83
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,640
<i>When a coworker asked
the product of 67 and 453...</i>

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,040
You know what?
I can't think while you're talking.

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,630
<i>... he drew a blank.</i>

86
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,710
- What?
- What?

87
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,250
<i>- Harold quickly answered, "30,351."
- What? Oh, nothing. 30,351.</i>

88
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,750
<i>Despite the answer
really being 31,305.</i>

89
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,350
Wait, wait, wait, 31,305. Sorry.

90
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,530
Dude, I just totally caught
some insurance adjuster...

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,260
...claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle.

92
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,700
I'll tell you, it is a shame...

93
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,330
...that they don't give out
an auditor of the year award.

94
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
Dude?

95
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,610
You okay?

96
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,840
Dave, I'm being followed.

97
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,360
How are you being followed?
You're not moving.

98
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,160
- It's by a voice.
- What?

99
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm being followed
by a woman's voice.

100
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,630
Okay.

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,330
What is she saying?

102
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,010
She's narrating.

103
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,850
Harold, you're staring at boxes,
what is she narrating?

104
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,150
No, no, no. I had to stop filing.

105
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,270
Watch. Watch. Listen. Listen.

106
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,860
<i>The sound the paper made
against the folder...</i>

107
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,150
<i>... had the same tone
as a wave scraping against sand.</i>

108
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
<i>And when Harold thought about it...</i>

109
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,630
<i>... he listened to enough waves
every day...</i>

110
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,720
<i>... to constitute what he imagined
to be a deep and endless ocean.</i>

111
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
Did you hear that?

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,840
You mean you filing?

113
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,640
No, no, no, the voice.

114
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,970
No.

115
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,900
Frightening part is sometimes I do
imagine a deep and endless ocean.

116
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,150
What ocean?

117
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,350
The one made by the sound...
Forget it.

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,530
New audits. Have a good day.

119
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,030
Thank you.

120
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,830
All right, we got a baker
and a securities trader.

121
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,050
Maybe you should take the baker.

122
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,870
- Okay?
- Okay.

123
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,710
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,950
- You miscreant.
- I understand.

125
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,590
Oh, get bent, taxman!

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,860
- Taxman!
- Taxman!

127
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,900
Taxman!

128
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,570
Go home!

129
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,540
Listen, is there somewhere else
we could talk about this?

130
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,440
No. We're gonna talk about this
right here.

131
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,280
Okay. It says, the file, that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year.

132
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,550
- That's right.
- Looks like only 78 percent.

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,420
Yep.

134
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,000
So you did it on purpose?

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,260
Yep.

136
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,170
So you must have been
expecting an audit?

137
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,060
I was expecting a fine...

138
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,840
...or a sharp reprimand.

139
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,340
A reprimand? This isn't
boarding school, Ms Pascal.

140
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,320
You stole from the government.

141
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:26,050
No, I didn't steal from the government.
I just didn't pay you entirely.

142
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,220
Ms Pascal, you can't just
not pay your taxes.

143
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,920
Yes, I can.

144
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,190
You can if you wanna get audited.

145
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,690
Only if I recognize your right
to audit me, Mr Crick.

146
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,810
Ms Pascal, I'm right here
auditing you.

147
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,270
Now I have to go over
your past three years...

148
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,640
...to make sure
that's all you haven't paid.

149
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
Fine.

150
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,200
Actually, you know, it's not fine.

151
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,310
Listen, I'm a big supporter
of fixing potholes...

152
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,850
...and erecting swing sets
and building shelters.

153
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,280
I am more than happy
to pay those taxes.

154
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm just not such a big fan
of the percentage...

155
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,720
...that the government uses
for national defense...

156
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,490
...corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds.

157
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,230
So I didn't pay those taxes.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,070
I think, actually...

159
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,970
...I sent a letter to that effect
with my return.

160
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,470
Would it be the letter that begins,
"Dear Imperialist Swine"?

161
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,780
Yes.

162
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,480
Ms Pascal, what you're describing
is anarchy. Are you an anarchist?

163
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,090
- You mean am I a member of...?
- An anarchist group, yes.

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,430
Anarchists have a group?

165
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,060
I believe so. Sure.

166
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,760
They assemble?

167
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,270
I don't know.

168
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,010
Wouldn't that completely
defeat the purpose?

169
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,710
<i>It was difficult for Harold to imagine
Ms Pascal as a revolutionary.</i>

170
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,150
<i>- Not now.
- Her thin arms...</i>

171
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,380
<i>- What?
...hoisting protest signs.</i>

172
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,120
<i>- Her long shapely legs...
- Nothing.</i>

173
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,750
<i>... dashing from tear gas.</i>

174
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,560
<i>Harold wasn't prone to fantasies...</i>

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,720
<i>... and so he tried his best
to remain professional.</i>

176
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,840
<i>But, of course, failed.</i>

177
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,600
<i>He couldn't help but imagine
Ms Pascal...</i>

178
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,820
<i>... stroking the side of his face
with the soft blade of her finger.</i>

179
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,610
<i>He couldn't help but imagine her
immersed in a tub...</i>

180
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,010
<i>... shaving her legs.</i>

181
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,980
<i>And he couldn't help
but imagine her naked...</i>

182
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,990
<i>... stretched across his bed.
- Mr Crick?</i>

183
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,060
- Mr Crick.
- Yes, what is it?

184
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,950
You're staring at my tits.

185
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,430
I wa...? I don't think I was.
I don't think I would do that.

186
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,220
If I was, I can assure you...

187
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,210
...it was only as a representative
of the United States government.

188
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,970
Sorry, I'm just having issues today.
So I'll be back on Tuesday.

189
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,190
<i>Harold suddenly found himself
beleaguered and exasperated...</i>

190
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,630
<i>... outside the bakery...
- Shut up!</i>

191
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,960
<i>... cursing the heavens in futility.</i>

192
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,390
No, I'm not, I'm cursing you,
you stupid voice!

193
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,330
So shut up and leave me alone!

194
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,280
Hey, watch it!

195
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,610
<i>Excuse me.</i>

196
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,290
Excuse me.

197
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,130
Are you Miss Eiffel?

198
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,860
- Yes.
- Excellent.

199
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
May I ask what you're doing?

200
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,660
Research.

201
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,790
- Oh, am I interrupting?
- Yes.

202
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm sorry. I'm Penny Escher.

203
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,690
I'm the assistant
your publishers hired.

204
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,210
- The spy.
- The assistant.

205
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,260
I provide the same services
as a secretary.

206
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,080
I don't need a secretary.

207
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,060
Then I will have to find some
other way of occupying my time.

208
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,900
Like watching me like a vulture...

209
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,570
...because the publishers
think I have writer's block, right?

210
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,430
Do you have writer's block?

211
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,540
Are these pages?

212
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,210
They're letters. To me.

213
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,280
- Are you writing back?
- I don't respond to letters.

214
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,480
And I suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes?

215
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,810
No, they came pre-smoked.

216
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,750
Yeah, they said you were funny.

217
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,860
What do you think about
leaping off a building?

218
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,530
I don't think about
leaping off buildings.

219
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,530
- Yes, you do.
- No. I try to think of nice things.

220
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,670
Everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings.

221
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,760
Well, I certainly don't think about
leaping off of a building.

222
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,280
They say...

223
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,890
I read this in this
fantastically depressing book.

224
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,150
- That when you jump
from a building...

225
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,690
...it's rarely the impact
that actually kills you.

226
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,260
Well, I'm sure it doesn't help.

227
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,630
<i>There's a photograph
in the book called The Leaper.</i>

228
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,750
It's old, but it's beautiful.

229
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,310
From above the corpse of a woman
who'd just leapt to her death.

230
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,300
There's blood around her head,
like a halo...

231
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,810
...and her leg's buckled underneath,
her arm's snapped like a twig...

232
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,540
...but her face is so serene...

233
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,150
...so at peace.

234
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,760
And I think it's because
when she died...

235
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,160
...she could feel the wind
against her face.

236
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,740
I don't know how to kill Harold Crick.
That's why they sent you.

237
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,280
Yes, to help you.

238
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,180
How are you gonna help me?

239
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,520
You, who never thinks
of leaping off buildings?

240
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,320
What great inspiration
will you bestow on me?

241
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,820
I'll tell you, the quaint ideas
you've gathered...

242
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,060
...in your adorable career
as an "assistant"...

243
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,160
...are to no avail
when faced with killing a man.

244
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,360
I understand.

245
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,390
Do you? I can't just...

246
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,810
As much as I would like to...

247
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,540
...I cannot simply throw
Harold Crick off a building.

248
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,450
Miss Eiffel. Kay. I've been
an author's assistant for 11 years.

249
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,630
I've helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books...

250
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,890
...and I've never missed the deadline.

251
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,100
And I have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time.

252
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,730
Now, I will be available to you
every minute of every day...

253
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,570
...until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page.

254
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,940
I do not like loud music.
I do not abide narcotics.

255
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,440
And I will gladly and quietly
help you kill Harold Crick.

256
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,780
I had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section.

257
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah?

258
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,800
They said you were feeling
a little wibbly-wobbly.

259
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,460
Catch a little cubicle fever?

260
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,320
Oh, I don't know. I think I'm okay.

261
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,940
Harold, a tree doesn't think
it's a tree...

262
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,340
...it is a tree.

263
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,650
<i>Why was Harold talking to this man?</i>

264
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,620
<i>This man was an idiot.</i>

265
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,320
<i>This man used words like
"wibbly-wobbly" and "convo. "</i>

266
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,920
<i>And explained that trees were trees.</i>

267
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,400
<i>Of course trees were trees.</i>

268
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,340
<i>Harold knew trees were trees.</i>

269
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,170
I am going to believe you, Harold.

270
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,810
<i>What Harold didn't know
was why he couldn't shake...</i>

271
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,580
<i>... the smell of brownies
from his senses.</i>

272
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,590
<i>Why Ms Pascal had made
his fingertips quiver and lips go numb.</i>

273
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,910
Harold?

274
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,450
Yes? Sorry.

275
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,220
What's going on, Harold?

276
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,990
Well...

277
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,520
Nothing. Everything's fine.

278
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,770
Listen, according to your records...

279
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,640
...you haven't taken vacation
in a few years now.

280
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,970
Let's say you take a little break.

281
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,950
Use some of that vaca time.

282
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,920
Yeah. I'll think about it.

283
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,620
Harold.

284
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,360
I'm not really supposed to do this,
but...

285
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,390
<i>Harold assumed his watch
was simply on the fritz...</i>

286
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:34,130
<i>... and never even considered that it
might be trying to tell him something.</i>

287
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,400
<i>In fact, Harold had never once
paid attention to his watch...</i>

288
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,470
<i>... other than to find out the time.</i>

289
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,730
<i>And, honestly,
it drove his watch crazy.</i>

290
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,740
<i>And so, on this particular
Wednesday evening...</i>

291
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,950
<i>... as Harold waited for the bus,
his watch suddenly...</i>

292
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,810
<i>... stopped.</i>

293
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,730
Sorry, does anyone have the time?

294
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,480
- Yeah, I got 6:18.
- Thanks.

295
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,790
<i>Thus Harold's watch thrust him
into the immitigable path of fate.</i>

296
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,470
<i>Little did he know that this simple,
seemingly innocuous act...</i>

297
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,310
<i>... would result in his imminent death.</i>

298
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,730
What? What?

299
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,930
Hey! Hello?

300
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,810
What?

301
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,770
Why?

302
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,170
Why my death?

303
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,810
Hello!

304
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,510
Excuse me!

305
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,680
When?

306
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,380
How imminent?

307
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,920
Okay, where are you?

308
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,460
"Harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times. "

309
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,530
Why won't you say anything?
I heard you.

310
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,950
"That would result
in his imminent death. "

311
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,780
I heard you!

312
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,200
Come on, you stupid voice.

313
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,880
"Harold frantically grabbed his lamp.

314
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,310
Harold, incensed, shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason!

315
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,190
And smashed it on the ground,
kicking it repeatedly!

316
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,000
Harold took his Kleenex box,
threw it across the room...

317
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,720
...then stormed the closet! "

318
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,400
Come on. Say something.

319
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,170
Something. Say something!

320
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,400
Say something!

321
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,190
"Harold, distraught... "

322
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,580
God.

323
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,150
"Harold, distraught..."

324
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,760
"Harold... "

325
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,190
<i>I'm afraid what you're describing
is schizophrenia.</i>

326
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,850
No. No. It's not schizophrenia.
It's just a voice in my head.

327
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,710
I mean, the voice isn't telling me
to do anything.

328
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,490
It's telling me what I've already done.

329
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,620
Accurately
and with a better vocabulary.

330
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,430
Mr Crick, you have a voice
speaking to you.

331
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,030
No, not to me, about me.

332
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm somehow involved
in some sort of story.

333
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
Like I'm a character in my own life.

334
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,740
But the problem is
that the voice comes and goes.

335
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,380
Like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me...

336
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,420
...and I need to find out what those
other parts are before it's too late.

337
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,260
Before the story concludes
with your death.

338
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,720
Yes.

339
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,200
Mr Crick, I hate to sound
like a broken record...

340
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,490
...but that's schizophrenia.

341
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,530
You don't sound like a broken record,
but it's just not schizophrenia.

342
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,440
What if what I said was true?

343
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,910
Hypothetically speaking,
if I was part of a story, a narrative...

344
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,980
...even if it was only in my mind...

345
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,560
...what would you suggest that I do?

346
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,960
I would suggest
you take prescribed medication.

347
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,920
Other than that.

348
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,030
I don't know.

349
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,220
I suppose I would send you to see
someone who knows about literature.

350
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,230
Okay.

351
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,200
Yeah. That's a good idea.

352
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,640
Thank you.

353
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,080
So you're the gentleman
who called me about the narrator.

354
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,920
- Yes.
- This narrator says you're gonna die.

355
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,080
Yes.

356
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,740
- How long has it given you to live?
- I don't know.

357
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,290
Dramatic irony.
It'll fuck you every time.

358
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,280
- So you crazy or what?
- Well...

359
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,730
Are you allowed to say that
to crazy people?

360
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,070
- I don't know.
- Oh, well. How many stairs...

361
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,360
...in the hallway out there?
- What?

362
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,040
You were counting them
as we walked, weren't you?

363
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,230
No.

364
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,340
Of course.
What bank do you work at?

365
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,500
No bank. IRS agent.

366
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,230
- Married?
- No.

367
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,470
Ever?

368
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,820
Engaged to an auditor.
She left me for an actuary.

369
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,580
- How heartbreaking. Live alone?
- Yes.

370
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,190
- Any pets?
- No.

371
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,430
- Friends?
- No. Well, Dave at work.

372
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,030
I see. The narrator,
exactly what does he sound like?

373
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,360
It's a woman.

374
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,900
A woman.

375
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,230
- Is it a familiar woman?
- No.

376
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,130
Someone you know?

377
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,200
No.

378
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,610
Did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom?

379
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,580
I wasn't counting the tiles.

380
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,780
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

381
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,450
- Sure?
- Yes.

382
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,290
So this woman, the voice,
told you you're gonna die?

383
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,730
She didn't tell me.
She doesn't know I can hear her.

384
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,520
- But she said it.
- Yes.

385
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,110
And you believed her.

386
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
She's been right
about a few other things.

387
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,360
- Such as?
- How I felt about work.

388
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,040
- You dislike your work?
- Yes.

389
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,510
Well, not the most insightful voice
in the world, is it?

390
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,980
First thing on a list
of what Americans hate: Work.

391
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,850
Second, traffic. Third, missing socks.
See what I'm saying?

392
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,810
Sort of.

393
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,220
I told you you were gonna die,
you believe me?

394
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,550
- No.
- Why?

395
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,120
I don't know you.

396
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,030
- But you don't know this narrator.
- Well...

397
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,220
- Okay, Mr Crick, I can't help you.
- Why?

398
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,700
Well, I'm not an expert in crazy,
I'm an expert in literature theory.

399
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,130
And I gotta tell you, thus far...

400
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,440
...there doesn't seem to be a single
literary thing about you.

401
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,940
I don't doubt you hear a voice,
but it couldn't possibly be a narrator...

402
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,180
...because, frankly, there doesn't seem
to be much to narrate.

403
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,820
Beside that, this semester
I'm teaching five courses.

404
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm mentoring
two doctoral candidates...

405
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,560
...and I'm the faculty lifeguard
at the pool.

406
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,760
- I just thought you could possibly...
- Perhaps you should keep a journal.

407
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,930
Write down what she said
or something.

408
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,660
That's all I can suggest.

409
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,470
I can barely remember it all.
I just remember:

410
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,960
"Little did he know that this simple,
seemingly innocuous act...

411
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,640
...would lead to his imminent death. "

412
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,710
- What?
- "Little did he know that this... "

413
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,680
- Did you say, "little did he know"?
- Yes.

414
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,050
I've written papers
on "little did he know. "

415
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,150
I used to teach a class
based on "little did he know. "

416
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,960
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar
on "little did he know. "

417
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
Son of a bitch, Harold.

418
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,870
"Little did he know" means there's
something he doesn't know...

419
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,090
...that means there's something
you don't know. Did you know that?

420
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,180
- I want you to come back Friday.
- Okay.

421
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,680
No, "imminent, "
you could be dead by Friday.

422
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,700
Come back tomorrow at 9:45.

423
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,950
Ten seconds ago
you said you wouldn't help me.

424
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,050
It's been a very revealing 10 seconds,
Harold.

425
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,090
<i>Harold was deep in thought.</i>

426
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,970
<i>For a few, brief moments, from
Born Boulevard to Euclid Avenue...</i>

427
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,640
<i>... all the calculations
and all the rules...</i>

428
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,260
<i>... and all the precision of Harold's life
just faded away.</i>

429
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,940
<i>How perfect then
that in this space...</i>

430
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,050
<i>... Ana Pascal would appear.</i>

431
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,510
Ms Pascal.

432
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,220
Ms Pascal, it's Harold Crick
from the IRS.

433
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,690
Excuse me.

434
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

435
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,630
- Would you like a seat?
- Nope.

436
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,860
There's 11 open ones.

437
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,800
I don't care.

438
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,800
Sorry about that.

439
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,990
How are you?

440
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,820
I'm lousy. I'm being audited.

441
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,420
Of course.

442
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,660
By a real creep too.

443
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,430
I think I owe you an apology.

444
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,900
- Really?
- IRS agents...

445
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,800
...we're given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work.

446
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,580
Unfortunately for you, we aren't tested
on tact or good manners...

447
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,010
...so I apologize.

448
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,010
I ogled you.

449
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,190
Sorry.

450
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,060
Okay, apology accepted.

451
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,830
But only because you stammered.

452
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,900
So you're a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too?

453
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,280
No. I'm just late.

454
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,510
Big flag-burning to get to?

455
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,210
Actually...

456
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,820
...it's my weekly evil-conspiracy
and needlepoint group.

457
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,790
You wanna come?

458
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,890
I left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home.

459
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,700
So...

460
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,300
<i>Harold nervously made small talk.</i>

461
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,780
You have very straight teeth.

462
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,640
<i>Very small talk.</i>

463
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,890
Thanks. They're real.

464
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,630
<i>Harold quickly calculated the odds
of making an ass of himself...</i>

465
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,850
<i>... in ratio to the amount of time
he stayed to chat.</i>

466
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,060
This is my stop. I should go.

467
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,800
<i>- He was elated and surprised...
- See you soon.</i>

468
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,290
<i>... by his somewhat flirtatious
encounter with Ms Pascal.</i>

469
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,480
<i>So elated that he exited
the Transit Authority bus...</i>

470
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,030
<i>... a good 27 blocks too early
and would now have to walk.</i>

471
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,440
<i>- "You ain't down yet. "
- That's right.</i>

472
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,180
<i>Tell us, what is You Ain't Got
Nothin' On Me about, Emmett Cole?</i>

473
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,940
<i>What does this mean?</i>

474
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,980
<i>Well, it's about being around
in the world, doing different things...</i>

475
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,750
<i>... doing what you wanna do...
- Come in.</i>

476
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,410
Mr Crick. Come in, come in. Please.

477
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,620
How are you?

478
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,580
I'm fine, actually.

479
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
You can turn that off.

480
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,840
Looks like our narrator
hasn't killed you quite yet.

481
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,100
- No, not yet.
- Good, great. Have a seat.

482
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,890
- Count the stairs outside?
- No.

483
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,010
Course not. I've devised a test...

484
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,790
How exciting is that?
- Of 23 questions...

485
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,650
...which I think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator.

486
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,480
- Now, Howard...
- Harold.

487
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,580
Harold. These may seem silly,
but your candor is paramount.

488
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,210
Okay.

489
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,090
So.

490
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,260
We know it's a woman's voice,
the story involves your death...

491
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,640
...it's modern, it's in English.

492
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city.

493
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,580
- Sure.
- Okay, good.

494
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,010
Question one:

495
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,920
"Has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home? "

496
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
Anything? Gum? Money?

497
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,930
- A large wooden horse?
- I'm sorry?

498
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,070
- Just answer the question.
- No.

499
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,060
"Do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries...

500
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,560
...in large, luxurious homes
to which...? " Let me finish.

501
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,370
"To which you may or may not
have been invited? "

502
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,560
No. No, no, no.

503
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,790
All right. On a scale of one to 10...

504
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,110
...what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated?

505
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,080
Assassinated?

506
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,410
One being very unlikely, 10 being
expecting it around every corner.

507
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,140
- I have no idea...
- Okay. Let me rephrase.

508
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Are you the king of anything?

509
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,290
- Like what?
- Anything.

510
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,790
King of the lanes
at the local bowling alley.

511
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,190
"King of the lanes"?

512
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,460
- King of the lanes. King of the trolls.
- "King of the trolls"?

513
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,760
Yes. A clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards.

514
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,270
- Anything.
- No.

515
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,530
No. That's ridiculous.

516
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,480
Agreed. But let's start with ridiculous
and move backwards.

517
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,610
Now, was any part of you at one time
part of something else?

518
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,920
Like do I have someone else's arms?

519
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,220
Well, is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone...

520
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,320
...wood, lye, varied corpse parts...

521
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,890
...or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders?

522
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,790
No. Look... I'm sorry. What do these
questions have to do with anything?

523
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,130
The only way to find out
what story you're in...

524
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,330
...is to determine what stories
you're not in.

525
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,800
Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out
half of Greek literature...

526
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,100
...seven fairy tales,
10 Chinese fables...

527
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,240
...and determined conclusively
that you are not King Hamlet...

528
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,230
...Scout Finch, Miss Marple...

529
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,100
...Frankenstein's monster,
or a golem.

530
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,320
Aren't you relieved to know
you're not a golem?

531
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,650
Yes, I am relieved to know
that I am not a golem.

532
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,820
Good.

533
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,550
Do you have magical powers?

534
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,480
May I ask what we're doing out here?

535
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,030
- We're imagining car wrecks.
- I see.

536
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,840
And we can't imagine
car wrecks inside?

537
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,370
No.

538
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,650
Did you know
that 41 percent of accidents...

539
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,140
...occur in times
of inclement weather?

540
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,730
So do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases.

541
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,720
Really? Pneumonia.
That's an interesting way to die.

542
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,290
But how would Harold
catch pneumonia?

543
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
Have you written
anything new today?

544
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,960
No.

545
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,170
Did you read the poems I suggested,
or make a list of words...

546
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,280
...buy new typing paper, anything?

547
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,900
No, none of it.

548
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,240
Sitting in the rain won't write books.

549
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,800
Well, that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books.

550
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,810
What's this?

551
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,930
It's literature on the nicotine patch.

552
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,890
I don't need a nicotine patch, Penny.
I smoke cigarettes.

553
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,630
Well, it may help.

554
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,960
May help? Help what?

555
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,340
Help what, Penny?
Help write a novel?

556
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,770
May help save your life.

557
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,750
I'm not in the business of saving lives.

558
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,340
In fact, just the opposite.

559
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,720
- "What's your favorite word? "
- Integer.

560
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,240
Good, good, good.

561
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,580
"Do you aspire to anything? "

562
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,490
- No.
- Conquer Russia?

563
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,260
- Win a whistling contest?
- No.

564
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,330
Harold, you must
have some ambition.

565
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,730
- I don't think so.
- Some underlying dream. Think.

566
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,500
Well...

567
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,750
...I've always wanted my life
to be more musical.

568
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,450
<i>- Like West Side Story?
- No.</i>

569
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,750
- Like...
- What?

570
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,450
Well, I've always wanted to learn
to play the guitar.

571
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,490
Okay.

572
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,500
The last thing
to determine conclusively...

573
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,200
...is whether you're in a comedy
or a tragedy.

574
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,720
To quote Italo Calvino:

575
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,210
"The ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces:

576
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,640
The continuity of life,
the inevitability of death. "

577
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,410
Tragedy, you die.
Comedy, you get hitched.

578
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,390
Most comic heroes
fall in love with people...

579
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,390
...introduced after the story
has begun.

580
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,220
Usually people
who hate the hero initially.

581
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,020
Although I can't imagine anyone
hating you, Harold.

582
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,030
Professor Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent.

583
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,590
Everyone hates me.

584
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,290
Right, right. Good.

585
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,810
Have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you?

586
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,500
I just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent.

587
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,260
Well, that sounds like a comedy.

588
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,350
Try to develop that.

589
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,180
Four of these?

590
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,520
You know, I didn't get my honey,
honey.

591
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,220
Lulu, can you refill the honey
for Larry? Quarters also?

592
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,850
That's my good boy.

593
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,990
I'm adding some acorns.

594
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,860
Mr Crick.

595
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,630
You're here early.
Must have a lot of people to extort.

596
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,500
No. No, just you.

597
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,670
- Twig tea and banana bread.
- Yes, ma'am.

598
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,550
Actually, it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe.

599
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,440
Well, I won't be paying no matter
the percentage, Mr Crick.

600
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,440
No, I know. But the percent
determines how big your cell is.

601
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,860
You know, you can call me Harold.

602
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,030
Yeah, I know. But I don't want to.

603
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,640
This is for Ramona, honey.

604
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,330
- Oh, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

605
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,280
What is that?
What are you marking?

606
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,330
Oh, this is nothing.

607
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,670
Why don't we start
with your backup documents...

608
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,550
...and the receipts
for the past three years.

609
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,040
Sure.

610
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,920
What's this?

611
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,420
- My files.
- What?

612
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,120
My tax files.

613
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,740
You keep your files like this?

614
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,540
No, actually I'm quite fastidious.

615
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,270
I put them in this box
just to screw with you.

616
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,160
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

617
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,960
So how was it? Aruba.

618
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,670
Ms Pascal? Can I just ask you
a question about this receipt?

619
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,740
- It was fantastic.
- Just wondering if this nine is a seven.

620
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,970
- And what did you do?
- I got a beautiful tan.

621
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,830
- I'm just gonna guess it's a seven.
- I mean, I feel stress-free.

622
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,200
Do you need help with that?

623
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,560
- Walk to heaven. I see the president.

624
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,930
- It's the taxman. Hello, Mr Taxman.
- Yeah.

625
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,590
- You can call me Harold.
- Okay.

626
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,430
- How the numbers going?
- Pretty good.

627
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,400
- Gonna find that 22 percent?
- 22 percent?

628
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,100
Twenty-two, 11 times 2.
It's prime numbers.

629
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,300
- You gonna tax the bathroom?
- No, I'm not gonna tax the bathroom.

630
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,770
- Could I use the bathroom, then?
- Go for it.

631
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,670
Okay. I wanna use the bathroom.
Bye now.

632
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,800
Bye-bye.

633
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,120
Well, good night.

634
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,910
You want a cookie?

635
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,680
Oh, no.

636
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,050
Come on. They're warm and gooey.
They're fresh out of the oven.

637
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,530
No, I don't like cookies.

638
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,190
You don't like cookies?

639
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,400
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

640
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,540
- Everybody likes cookies.
- No, I know.

641
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,650
I mean, after a really awful,
no-good day...

642
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,080
...didn't your mama ever make you
milk and cookies?

643
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,410
No. My mother didn't bake.

644
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,750
The only cookies I ever had
were store-bought.

645
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,130
Okay. Sit down.

646
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,890
- No, I'm...
- No.

647
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,160
Sit down.

648
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,230
Now...

649
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,270
...eat a cookie.

650
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,840
I really can't.

651
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,380
Mr Crick, it was a really awful day.

652
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,120
I know, I made sure of it.

653
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,310
So pick up the cookie...

654
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,650
...dip it in the milk...

655
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,650
...and eat it.

656
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,590
That's a really, really good cookie.

657
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,570
So when did you decide
to become a baker?

658
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,830
- In college.
- Oh, like a cooking college?

659
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,100
I went to Harvard Law actually.

660
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,800
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed it was...
- No. No, it's fine. I didn't finish.

661
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,550
- Did something happen?
- No.

662
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,940
I was barely accepted.
I mean, really barely.

663
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,490
The only reason they let me come
was because of my essay.

664
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:22,510
How I was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree.

665
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,990
Anyway, we would have to participate
in these study sessions...

666
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,300
...my classmates and I,
sometimes all night long.

667
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,230
And so I'd bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked.

668
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,510
Sometimes I would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm...

669
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,540
...and then I'd bring my little treats
to the study groups...

670
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,370
...and people loved them.

671
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,840
Eat.

672
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,310
I made oatmeal cookies,
peanut-butter bars...

673
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,220
...dark-chocolate
macadamia-nut wedges.

674
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,930
And everyone would eat
and stay happy...

675
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,330
...and study harder
and do better on the tests.

676
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,230
More and more people started
coming to the study groups...

677
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,060
...and I'd bring more snacks.

678
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,000
I was always looking
for better and better recipes...

679
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,530
...until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants...

680
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,930
...and mocha bars
with an almond glaze...

681
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,780
...and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing.

682
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,910
And at the end of the semester
I had 27 study partners...

683
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,560
...eight Mead journals
filled with recipes...

684
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,280
...and a D average.

685
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,030
So I dropped out.

686
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,370
I figured if I was gonna
make the world a better place...

687
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,530
...I would do it with cookies.

688
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,810
You like them?

689
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,300
I do.

690
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,180
I'm glad.

691
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,690
Thank you for forcing me
to eat them.

692
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,850
You're welcome.

693
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,090
I should go. Oh, thank you.
For the cookies, I mean.

694
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,060
- Why don't you take them home?
- Oh, no.

695
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,310
- Oh, come on.
- No, really, please.

696
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,670
- No, really, please.
- No, no, no. Really, please.

697
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,730
I would like to, but I can't.

698
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,140
- You can't?
- No, no, I mean...

699
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,840
Because, see, it constitutes a gift.

700
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,950
Actually I shouldn't have even had
those other ones, so...

701
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,350
Okay. Well, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

702
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,190
- No. I know, but if you did...
- Well, I'm not going to.

703
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,490
I know, but if you did...

704
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,760
- What, you think I'm gonna call the...?
- No, no. I'll purchase them.

705
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,880
I'm happy to purchase them.
How's that?

706
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,330
And then there are no issues.

707
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,660
- What?
- No.

708
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,930
- Please.
- Just...

709
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,050
- Why don't I just...?
- Go home.

710
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,670
Really, it's not a big deal.

711
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,800
Go home.

712
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,840
Okay.

713
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,750
Did you?

714
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,350
You baked those cookies for me,
didn't you?

715
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,560
You were just trying to be nice
and I totally blew it.

716
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,530
This may sound like gibberish
to you...

717
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,530
...but I think I'm in a tragedy.

718
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,180
Professor Hilbert, I've totally failed
at the comedy-tragedy thing.

719
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,550
In fact, I think she likes me even less.

720
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,120
- I know, it's great.
- What do you mean?

721
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,050
You've proved something else
entirely.

722
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,710
The voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take.

723
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,490
You reset your watch,
it says you reset your watch.

724
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,490
You ride a bus,
it says you ride the bus.

725
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,060
You brush your teeth,
it says you brush your teeth.

726
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,090
It may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story.

727
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,960
- So I suggest we try something else.
- Like what?

728
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,400
- Try nothing. Nothing.
- What about Ms Pascal?

729
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,010
- Forget her.
- Forget her?

730
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,180
Other than numbers,
she's all I think about.

731
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,120
Harold, if you wanna stay alive,
you'll try something else.

732
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,450
- That something being nothing?
- Nothing, exactly.

733
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,350
- Nothing?
- Let me explain this again.

734
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,390
Some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises.

735
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,290
Others are moved forward
by the characters themselves.

736
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,700
If I go through that door,
the plot continues.

737
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,170
The story of me through the door.
If I stay here...

738
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,800
...the plot can't move forward,
the story ends.

739
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,600
Also if I stay here, I'm late.

740
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,450
- Don't do anything tomorrow.
- Nothing?

741
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:11,000
Stay home. Don't answer the phone,
open the door, brush your teeth.

742
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,820
- What about work?
- Call them.

743
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,250
- Tell them you're not coming.
- Don't go to work?

744
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,590
Don't do anything that may
move the plot forward.

745
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,260
Instead, let's see if the plot finds you.

746
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,850
Marshall, you're not kicking.

747
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,930
<i>- Certain that these geese have never
known any home but this one:</i>

748
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,440
<i>A small lake in Eastern Poland.</i>

749
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,940
<i>Pollution from a nearby factory
is slowly killing...</i>

750
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,640
<i>... the small fish and insects
on which these creatures feed.</i>

751
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:45,080
<i>All attempts to move the birds to
similar bodies of water have failed.</i>

752
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,120
<i>Perhaps it is the familiarity alone
that keeps them here.</i>

753
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,320
<i>Or perhaps it's an unwillingness
to lose the collective memory...</i>

754
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,530
<i>... of the once-beautiful hills
that surround the lake.</i>

755
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,400
<i>And it takes only seconds
for the fiddler crabs to realize...</i>

756
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,930
<i>... that the wader
they might once have feared...</i>

757
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,420
<i>... has now become their prey.</i>

758
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,640
<i>The wounded bird knows its fate.</i>

759
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,940
<i>Its desperate attempts to escape...</i>

760
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,040
<i>... only underscore the hopelessness
of its plight.</i>

761
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,090
<i>The primates' sad, soulful eyes
will be the first to be plucked out...</i>

762
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,090
<i>... then sold to cosmetic companies
around the world...</i>

763
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,290
<i>... for use in the testing of mascara
and artificial tears.</i>

764
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,370
<i>Next, the monkeys' fur will be stripped
away from their limp corpses...</i>

765
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,940
<i>... and sewn together
to form pillows and comforters.</i>

766
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,640
<i>Mr Zebra thought he was gonna
take a nice drink.</i>

767
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,470
<i>But you never know
who's gonna eat...</i>

768
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,940
<i>... when you're dining
at Mother Nature's restaurant.</i>

769
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,850
<i>That's gotta hurt. What does
this bald eagle wanna serve...</i>

770
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,080
<i>... with some kidney beans
and a fine Chianti?</i>

771
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,070
<i>It's an eel. And again:</i>

772
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,750
<i>Looks like old Mr Crocodile
wanted some antelope...</i>

773
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,990
<i>... to clear that salty zebra
from his palate.</i>

774
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,560
<i>Here's a struggle betting gentlemen
have been known to put money on.</i>

775
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,500
<i>When a mongoose encounters a cobra
it's hard to know who's gonna win.</i>

776
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,870
<i>But this time it looks like
it's... the cobra...</i>

777
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,170
<i>... who's putting the squeeze
on the mongoose!</i>

778
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,600
<i>But don't cash in your chips
just yet, gentlemen...</i>

779
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,360
<i>... because now it's the mongoose
who holds the winning card!</i>

780
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,830
Hey! Hey!

781
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,710
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

782
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,880
- Holy crapping hell.
- What the hell is that?

783
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,280
- Stop the crane. Stop it.
- Stop the crane!

784
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,320
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

785
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,110
Us? What are you doing?

786
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,980
I was watching TV.

787
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,850
- Well, we're demolishing this place.
- Are you nuts? I live here!

788
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,790
- Is that a TV?
- Yes, that's a TV! It's my TV!

789
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,930
- Well, what's your TV doing in there?
- I said I live here, stupid!

790
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,710
It's where I keep my stuff!

791
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,190
My name's on the goddamn buzzer!
Harold Crick.

792
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,370
Apartment 2-B, 1893 McCarthy!

793
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,800
- Did you say 1893?
- Yes!

794
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,580
I'm not exactly sure it was plot.

795
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,820
I was hoping you'd say it was
just a really bad coincidence.

796
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,450
Meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence.

797
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:41,360
Getting a letter from the emperor
saying that he's visiting is plot.

798
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,520
Having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball...

799
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,580
...is something else entirely.

800
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,460
Harold, you don't control your fate.

801
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,640
- I know.
- You do?

802
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,940
Okay. Come with me.

803
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,040
Hey, Tom, can you leave that
till tomorrow?

804
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,950
You were right.
This narrator might very well kill you...

805
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,770
...so I humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life.

806
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:14,800
Go live my life? I am living my life.
I'd like to continue to live my life.

807
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:19,190
I know. Of course. I mean all of it.
However long you have left.

808
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,030
You know, I mean, Howard,
you could use it to have an adventure.

809
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,770
<i>You know, invent something, or just
finish reading Crime and Punishment.</i>

810
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:32,080
Hell, Harold, you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted.

811
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,070
What's wrong with you?

812
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,620
Hey. I don't wanna eat
nothing but pancakes. I wanna live.

813
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,820
Who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living...

814
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,990
...chooses pancakes?

815
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,090
Harold, if you'd pause to think
I believe you'd realize...

816
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,490
...that that answer's
inextricably contingent...

817
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,690
...upon the type of life being led...

818
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,260
...and, of course,
the quality of the pancakes.

819
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,580
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

820
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,360
Yes, I do.

821
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,480
But you have to understand that this
isn't a philosophy or a literary theory...

822
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,480
...or a story to me. It's my life.

823
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,180
Absolutely. So just go make it the one
you've always wanted.

824
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,830
I never expected
that they would have...

825
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,860
- Do you want one, two?
- I want one.

826
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,160
- One?
- I want two.

827
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,110
All right, so here's your room.

828
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,700
Or as I like to call it, Sleep Pod Two.

829
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,610
Thanks, Dave.

830
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,310
No problem, dude.
It'll be nice having you around.

831
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,590
- How long you planning on staying?
- I'm not sure.

832
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,920
Dave, can I pose a somewhat abstract,
purely hypothetical question?

833
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,870
Sure.

834
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,730
If you knew you were gonna die...

835
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,900
...possibly soon...

836
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,240
...what would you do?

837
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,880
Wow, I don't know.

838
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,880
Am I the richest man in the world?

839
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,080
No, you're you.

840
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,240
Do I have a superpower?

841
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,450
No, you're you.

842
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,460
I know I'm me,
but do I have a superpower?

843
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,200
No, why would you
have a superpower?

844
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,930
I don't know,
you said it was hypothetical.

845
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,990
Fine. Yes. You're really good at math.

846
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,710
That's not a power, that's a skill.

847
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,610
Okay, you're good at math
and you're invisible.

848
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,510
- And you know you're gonna die.
- Okay, okay.

849
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,420
That's easy, I'd go to space camp.

850
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,710
Space camp?

851
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,930
Yeah, it's in Alabama. It's where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts.

852
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,200
I've always wanted to go
since I was 9.

853
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,660
You're invisible
and you'd go to space camp?

854
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,760
I didn't pick invisible,
you picked invisible.

855
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,670
Aren't you too old
to go to space camp?

856
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,440
You're never too old
to go to space camp, dude.

857
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,400
Space camp.

858
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,540
<i>One hundred and twenty-two
guitars.</i>

859
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,210
<i>Seven hundred and thirty-two
strings.</i>

860
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,550
<i>Two hundred and fifty-seven
pickups.</i>

861
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,180
<i>One hundred and eighty-nine
volume knobs.</i>

862
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:05,120
<i>Here Harold stood, face to face
with his oldest desire.</i>

863
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,650
<i>And stand is almost all Harold did.</i>

864
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,360
<i>It wasn't just about finding
a guitar.</i>

865
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,560
<i>It was about finding a guitar
that said something about Harold.</i>

866
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,870
<i>Unfortunately, this guitar said:</i>

867
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,820
<i>"When I get back to Georgia,
that woman gonna feel my pain. "</i>

868
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,080
<i>This one said something
along the lines of:</i>

869
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,050
<i>"Why, yes, these pants are Lycra. "</i>

870
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,550
<i>These said, "I'm very sensitive,
very caring...</i>

871
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:39,170
<i>... and I have absolutely no idea
how to play the guitar. "</i>

872
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,220
<i>"I'm compensating for something.
Guess what. "</i>

873
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,850
<i>And then Harold saw it.</i>

874
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,240
<i>A damaged and terribly mistreated
sea-foam-green Fender...</i>

875
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,080
<i>... staring back at him.</i>

876
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,010
<i>Despite its obvious maladies...</i>

877
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,480
<i>... the guitar spoke
with conviction and swagger.</i>

878
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,320
<i>In fact, it looked Harold directly
in the eye and very plainly stated:</i>

879
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,020
<i>"I rock. "</i>

880
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,390
Just breathe. Watch it!

881
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,620
We've got a 21 -year-old male
with a gunshot wound to the chest.

882
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,390
There you go.

883
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,200
Shot in a gang fight?
Harold's not in a gang.

884
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,670
Man in tweed?

885
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,210
There's nothing wrong with him,
he just likes looking at sick people.

886
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,410
Oddly spoken with disdain.

887
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,110
This isn't working.

888
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,890
Well... I don't even know
why we're here.

889
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,850
I don't think we're supposed
to be here.

890
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,290
- You said I needed visual stimuli.
- I meant a museum.

891
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,660
I don't need a goddamn museum.
I need the infirm.

892
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,650
You are the infirm.

893
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,900
You're right. The problem is
these people aren't dead...

894
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,940
...they're just severely injured.

895
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,500
Excuse me,
where are the dying people?

896
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,740
Most of these people
are sick or injured...

897
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,040
Which is great, don't get me wrong.

898
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,910
- But they're gonna get better,
which doesn't really help me.

899
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,450
Is there any way to see the people
who aren't going to get better?

900
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,420
Excuse me?

901
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,020
I'd like to see, if at all possible,
the ones who aren't gonna make it.

902
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,860
You know, the dead-for-sure ones.

903
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,690
I'm sorry,
are you suffering from anything?

904
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,220
Just writer's block.

905
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,120
<i>With every awkward strum...</i>

906
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:38,940
<i>... Harold Crick became stronger
in who he was...</i>

907
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,670
<i>... what he wanted,
and why he was alive.</i>

908
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,780
<i>Harold no longer ate alone.</i>

909
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,220
<i>He no longer counted brushstrokes.</i>

910
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,020
<i>- Harold, I'll see you.
- He no longer wore neckties.</i>

911
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:53,990
Bye, Dave.

912
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:59,940
<i>And, therefore, no longer worried
about the time it took to put them on.</i>

913
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,460
<i>He no longer counted his steps
to the bus stop.</i>

914
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:13,240
<i>Instead, Harold did that
which had terrified him before.</i>

915
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,820
<i>That which had eluded him
Monday through Friday...</i>

916
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,980
<i>... for so many years.</i>

917
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,720
<i>That which the unrelenting lyrics...</i>

918
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,950
<i>... of numerous punk-rock songs
told him to do:</i>

919
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,790
<i>Harold Crick lived his life.</i>

920
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,800
<i>But despite resuscitating his life...</i>

921
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:47,250
<i>... reviving his hope, and instilling
a few wicked calluses...</i>

922
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,740
<i>... Harold's journey
was still incomplete.</i>

923
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,220
<i>And Harold's wristwatch wasn't about
to let him miss another opportunity.</i>

924
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,730
Ms Pascal?

925
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,660
- Ms Pascal?
- Mr Crick.

926
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

927
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

928
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,040
I'm glad I caught you.

929
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,180
Oh, yeah? Why?

930
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,850
Because I wanted
to bring these to you.

931
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,810
- Really?
- Yeah.

932
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,390
So you can't accept gifts,
but you can give them?

933
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,630
- Listen...
- I don't know.

934
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,260
That seems a little inconsistent,
doesn't it, Mr Crick?

935
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,700
Very inconsistent, yes.

936
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,230
I'll tell you what.
I'll purchase them.

937
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:44,880
- No.
- No, no, no, really...

938
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,680
...I'd like to purchase them.
What are they?

939
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,640
Flours.

940
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,740
- What?
- I brought you flours.

941
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:08,620
And you carried them
all the way here?

942
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,390
Ms Pascal, I've been odd
and I know that I've been odd.

943
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,230
And I want you.

944
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,240
- What?
- There's so many reasons.

945
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,810
There's so many influences in my life
that are telling me...

946
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,530
...at times quite literally...

947
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,550
...that I should come here
and bring you these...

948
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,020
...but I'm doing this
because I want you.

949
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,720
You want me?

950
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,750
In no uncertain terms.

951
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,790
Isn't there some very clear
and established...

952
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,630
...rule about fraternization?

953
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,030
- Auditor-auditee protocol?
- Yeah.

954
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,500
Yeah, but I don't care.

955
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,240
- Why?
- Because I want you.

956
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,750
Well...

957
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,250
...do you mind carrying those
a little bit further?

958
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,090
Okay.

959
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,260
Okay.

960
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,910
Did you make a key?

961
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,360
No, I just committed it to memory.

962
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,540
- The blue, that's barley flour.
- What's that one?

963
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,120
- The orange?
- Yeah.

964
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,910
I forget.

965
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,490
Right here.

966
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,820
Do you wanna come up?

967
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,820
- To your place?
- Yeah.

968
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,370
I guess I could.

969
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,510
Wasn't that the idea with the flours
and everything?

970
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,170
Honestly, I only figured it out
up to "I want you. "

971
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,170
Listen, Mr Crick...

972
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,640
...I think I like you.

973
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:20,920
And before I do anything rash,
I'd like to make sure.

974
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,490
I'd like you to come up.

975
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,860
I'd be honored.

976
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,430
Great.

977
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,410
<i>Yeah, he was nuts though.</i>

978
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:39,310
<i>He got caught when he tried
to get the contract notarized.</i>

979
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,070
No. No.

980
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:47,950
Was it good?

981
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,520
Thank you.

982
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,190
- You're welcome.
- Can I help you?

983
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:56,680
No, no, I'm gonna put them in the sink.
Go sit down on the couch.

984
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,050
So do you play the guitar?

985
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,600
- What?
- Do you play the guitar?

986
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:14,540
Terribly. Someone traded me that
for a wedding cake.

987
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,380
Does that mean I have to claim it
on my taxes now?

988
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:23,040
- No. I'll leave it out of my final report.
- Oh, thanks.

989
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,350
Do you play?

990
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,260
Not really. I only know one song.

991
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,660
Oh, play it.

992
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,300
No, I don't know it that well, actually.

993
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,370
No, come on. I promise I'm not gonna
laugh at you. Play it.

994
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,610
No, no, no. Maybe some other time.

995
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,290
All right.

996
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,140
Ms Pascal?

997
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,850
- I...
- I know.

998
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,020
I want you too.

999
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:36,580
<i>Harold's life was filled with moments
both significant and mundane.</i>

1000
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:42,050
<i>But to Harold, those moments
remained entirely indistinguishable...</i>

1001
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,950
<i>... except for this.</i>

1002
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,700
<i>As Ana let out a soft sigh and
repositioned herself against him...</i>

1003
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,030
<i>... Harold knew
somewhere in his heart...</i>

1004
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:55,030
<i>... that this was one
of the significant moments.</i>

1005
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,900
<i>He knew she was
falling in love with him.</i>

1006
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,480
Professor Hilbert. It's a comedy.

1007
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,200
- What?
- A comedy.

1008
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,870
The woman. The one who hates me.
Ana Pascal?

1009
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,180
- Last night...
- Yeah?

1010
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,220
She's falling in love with me.

1011
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,190
- She is?
- It's like a miracle.

1012
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,720
The voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night.

1013
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,330
Well, that's wonderful, Harold.

1014
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,560
I mean, it completely nullifies my list,
but that's fantastic.

1015
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,650
What list?

1016
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,270
These are seven living authors
whose prior work...

1017
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,170
...would seem to make them
candidates to write your story...

1018
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:33,070
...based on the criteria you and I
previously determined.

1019
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:37,270
If your narrator is alive,
she's on this list.

1020
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,110
But it appears the list
is of little use to you now.

1021
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,280
Now that you're gonna live
happily ever after.

1022
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,970
Oh, goodie. This woman, Karen Eiffel,
she's one of my favorite authors.

1023
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,570
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

1024
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:51,890
Beautiful tragedies. Just beautiful.
Anyway...

1025
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,420
...let me quickly copy this list for you,
just in case.

1026
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,530
Sociopathic author.

1027
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,390
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Of course.

1028
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:08,010
Listen, please, you must tell me if you
hear the voice of the narrator again...

1029
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,680
...just for my own edification.

1030
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,170
I will.

1031
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,520
<i>Well, it's called Death and Taxes.</i>

1032
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,250
<i>Wow. You know, I'm from Texas.</i>

1033
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:23,010
<i>No. Not "Texas. " Taxes.</i>

1034
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,420
Death and Taxes.
Death and Taxes.

1035
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,760
<i>Taxes.
Like the Benjamin Franklin quote.</i>

1036
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,620
<i>Precisely so.</i>

1037
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,960
<i>This lady's a package,
I'm telling you.</i>

1038
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,670
<i>Tell us, what is this next book
going to be about?</i>

1039
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,140
<i>It's about interconnectivity.</i>

1040
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,100
<i>The looming certainty of death.</i>

1041
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,140
<i>Men's fashion accessories.</i>

1042
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,190
- Oh, my God, that's her.
- What?

1043
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,510
- That's the voice. She's the narrator.
- No, that can't be right.

1044
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,180
No, I'm positive.

1045
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,890
Harold, this interview's a decade old.

1046
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:56,860
<i>I didn't think anyone actually
wore cuff links anymore.</i>

1047
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,550
That's her.

1048
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,490
- She's British?
- She's her.

1049
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,190
- Karen Eiffel?
- Professor Hilbert, I know that voice.

1050
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:06,800
Crap.

1051
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,100
- What's wrong?
- First of all, she wasn't on my list.

1052
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,770
I figured you would have mentioned
the accent and she doesn't...

1053
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,230
She kills people.

1054
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,740
- What?
- In every book she...

1055
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:23,720
The books are all about...
They die. She kills them.

1056
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,650
- Kills who?
- The heroes.

1057
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,360
<i>Four Black Veils. What is that?</i>

1058
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,290
<i>It's about a girl who loses
several members of her family...</i>

1059
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,090
<i>... in quick succession.</i>

1060
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,320
Where is she?

1061
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:40,560
She's untraceable. Believe me,
I used to teach a class on her.

1062
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:44,240
I've written her letters. I mean,
she's a hermit, she's a recluse.

1063
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,500
Here. Here's the last book she wrote.

1064
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,980
Look at the copyright. She hasn't
published anything in 10 years.

1065
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,510
She had knowledge of the city.
Does she live here?

1066
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,180
She used to, yes, but I mean...

1067
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,350
Banneker Press. 2267 Wallace Street.
Is that her publisher?

1068
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,720
You're not listening. I said even
if you find her she's not gonna...

1069
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,300
Thank you for your help.

1070
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,080
She only writes tragedies!

1071
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,270
<i>I don't believe in God.</i>

1072
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:37,690
Okay, he's bringing her flours.

1073
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:51,860
Kay, where you been?

1074
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,770
I went out to buy cigarettes...

1075
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,880
...and I figured out
how to kill Harold Crick.

1076
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,340
Buying cigarettes?

1077
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:04,980
As I was...
When I came out of the store...

1078
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,550
...it came to me.

1079
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,520
How?

1080
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,190
Well, Penny,
like anything worth writing...

1081
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:15,250
...it came inexplicably
and without method.

1082
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,690
I see. Then what happens?

1083
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:23,940
It's perfect, actually. I can't believe
I didn't think of it earlier.

1084
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,870
It's simple, ironic...

1085
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,570
...possibly heartbreaking.

1086
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,210
Is that it?

1087
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,600
Yes.

1088
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,650
- You wrote it on legal sheets?
- On the bus.

1089
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,620
Well, then.

1090
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:47,430
So I'll finish it today.

1091
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,410
I'll let the publishers know.

1092
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,960
I'll begin packing my things.

1093
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,130
I appreciate it.

1094
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,750
- Hi. Hello. Hi.
- May I help you?

1095
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,070
I need to speak to Karen Eiffel.

1096
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,760
- I'm sorry?
- Karen Eiffel.

1097
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,160
She's one of your authors.
I need to talk to her.

1098
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,090
Well, sir, she's not here.

1099
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,600
No. No, I know. I need to find her.
I need to know where she is.

1100
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,070
We're just the publishers.

1101
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:32,360
Right. Of course. But there must be
a way that I can contact her.

1102
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,870
We have the address
where her fan mail is sent.

1103
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,180
No, I can't send mail. It's urgent.

1104
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,160
How do you know her?

1105
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,810
- I'm her brother.
- Her brother?

1106
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:46,320
- Her brother-in-law.
- She has a sister?

1107
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,390
No, I'm married to her brother.

1108
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,920
Not in this state, the one over.

1109
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,160
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1110
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,660
No. Okay. Listen.

1111
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:07,460
I'm one of her characters. I'm new.
I'm in her new book.

1112
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,080
And she's going to kill me.
Not actually. But in the book.

1113
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,080
But I think it'll actually kill me
so I just need to talk to her...

1114
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,240
...and ask her to stop.

1115
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,700
Hi, Harold. Nice sweater.

1116
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,470
Hi, Harold. Phones are out.

1117
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,580
Hey, Harold, 19 percent of 4632?

1118
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,740
Hey, Harold. Back from your vaca?

1119
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,350
Hey. Looking good.

1120
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,590
- He looks terrible.
- Yeah, banged up.

1121
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,260
Wherever he went,
I do not want to go.

1122
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,620
Book me not there.

1123
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,510
He's totally ignoring me.

1124
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,730
Here, look at this now.
There he goes.

1125
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,250
It was good having you.

1126
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,460
- Oh, dude, the phones are out.
- Can I borrow your cell phone?

1127
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,730
- The signal's down.
- Damn it.

1128
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:41,440
- You all right?
- Dave, I need a favor.

1129
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:44,470
- Sure, what is it?
- Can I have some change?

1130
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,880
<i>Within moments, Harold found himself
running across the plaza...</i>

1131
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,110
<i>... heading for the nearest
pay phone.</i>

1132
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,130
<i>At last, he spotted it.</i>

1133
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,320
<i>But as Harold neared the phone,
he saw it was occupied...</i>

1134
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,830
<i>... by an octogenarian determined
to reach his daughter in Denver...</i>

1135
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,100
<i>... no matter how many quarters
it took.</i>

1136
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,600
<i>Fortunately, Harold remembered
a bank of phones...</i>

1137
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,570
<i>... in the Sixth Street subway tunnel.</i>

1138
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:18,250
The baby's name isn't Mrs. Epstein.
My daughter's name is Mrs. Epstein.

1139
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,390
<i>The first phone
failed to give a dial tone.</i>

1140
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,390
<i>And the second
seemed to be splattered...</i>

1141
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,770
<i>... with a fresh batch of mucus.</i>

1142
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,870
<i>Harold dialed the third phone...</i>

1143
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:52,540
<i>... fervently making sure to give each
number key a specific forceful push.</i>

1144
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:14,530
Don't answer that!

1145
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:17,040
Didn't you say this phone never r...?

1146
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,060
- Hello?
- Is this Karen Eiffel?

1147
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,130
- Yes.
- My name is Harold Crick.

1148
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,900
I believe you're writing a story
about me.

1149
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,100
- I'm sorry?
- My name is Harold Crick.

1150
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,290
<i>- Is this a joke?
- No.</i>

1151
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,780
No, I work for the IRS. My name,
Miss Eiffel, is Harold Crick.

1152
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:06,350
<i>When I go through the files at work
I hear a deep and endless ocean.</i>

1153
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,210
<i>- Oh, G...!
- Miss Eiffel?</i>

1154
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,710
Hello?

1155
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,050
<i>Miss Eiffel? Hello?</i>

1156
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,560
Let him in.

1157
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,570
Hello.

1158
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,170
Hello.

1159
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,280
I'm Penny. I'm Kay's assistant.

1160
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,180
Oh, I'm Harold. Her main character.

1161
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,160
Oh, my God.

1162
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,570
Oh, my God.

1163
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,570
Oh, my God.

1164
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,050
Miss Eiffel?

1165
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,720
Your hair. Your eyes.

1166
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,520
Your fingers.

1167
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,730
Your shoes.

1168
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,990
Hello.

1169
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
I'm Harold Crick.

1170
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,670
I know.

1171
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,960
How did you find me?

1172
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:50,310
We audited you
a little more than 10 years ago...

1173
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,700
...and your number was in the file.

1174
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,350
I'm sorry,
but this is incredibly strange.

1175
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,220
You're telling me.

1176
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:02,040
Didn't you think you were crazy?

1177
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,150
Sort of.

1178
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,130
But then you were right
about everything. Like, everything.

1179
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,540
And then you said,
"Little did he know. "

1180
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:14,670
- "Little did he know"?
- Yeah. It's third-person omniscient.

1181
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,500
Jesus.

1182
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:20,480
Which meant it was, well, you know,
someone other than me.

1183
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,250
At least that's what
Professor Hilbert said.

1184
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,340
Professor Hilbert?

1185
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,800
- Professor Jules Hilbert?
- Yeah.

1186
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,620
Yeah, he loves your books.

1187
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,460
I love his letters. I don't...

1188
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,900
So you understand
why I had to find you...

1189
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,130
...and ask you not to kill me.
- What?

1190
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,640
I mean, obviously
you haven't written the end.

1191
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,470
Harold...

1192
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:49,900
I mean, now since we've met
and you can see that I exist...

1193
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,290
...you're not gonna kill me, right?

1194
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,640
Have you written it?

1195
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,740
I can... No.

1196
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:01,050
- Have you written it?
- An outline.

1197
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,120
Okay. But it's just an outline, right?

1198
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,910
- Yeah, sort of.
- "Sort of"?

1199
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,660
- It's just not typed.
- "Not typed"?!

1200
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,360
- Maybe that's okay.
- What does that mean?

1201
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,970
- I'm sorry, I'm trying to write a book.
- What do you mean it's "okay"?

1202
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,200
- What do you mean you're sorry?
- Kay.

1203
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,960
Let him read it.

1204
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,570
Let him read it.

1205
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,860
- Did you find her?
- Yeah.

1206
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,660
- And?
- I may already be dead...

1207
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,660
...just not typed.

1208
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,690
Is that it?

1209
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,030
Did you read it?

1210
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,530
I tried, but I couldn't.

1211
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:55,040
You have to read it.

1212
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,710
You have to tell me
what to do or what not to do.

1213
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:01,150
If I can avoid it...

1214
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,520
If I have a chance...

1215
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,440
Please.

1216
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,760
Okay.

1217
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,620
Okay.

1218
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,600
And here's your uniform.

1219
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:02,770
It's a go. Banetta's outside,
she'll assign you your locker.

1220
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,680
- And you roll.
- I'm ready.

1221
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,700
Professor Hilbert?

1222
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:09,840
- Hi, Harold.
- Hi.

1223
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,110
You look tired.

1224
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:16,140
No, no, just calm.

1225
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:21,450
Harold, I'm sorry.

1226
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,890
You have to die.

1227
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,090
What?

1228
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,790
It's her masterpiece.

1229
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:39,300
It's possibly the most important novel
in her already stunning career...

1230
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:43,170
...and it's absolutely no good
unless you die at the end.

1231
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,250
I've been over it again and again...

1232
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,880
...and I know how hard this is
for you to hear.

1233
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,220
You're asking me
to knowingly face my death?

1234
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,950
Yes.

1235
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,120
Really?

1236
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,400
Yes.

1237
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:19,570
I thought you'd...
I thought you'd find something.

1238
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,010
I'm sorry, Harold.

1239
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:29,350
Can't we just try and just see
if she can change it?

1240
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,020
- No.
- No?

1241
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,630
Harold...

1242
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,760
...in the grand scheme
it wouldn't matter.

1243
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:42,770
- Yes, it would.
- No.

1244
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:46,840
I could change.

1245
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,200
I could quit my job.

1246
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:54,040
I could go away with Ana.

1247
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,080
I could be someone else.

1248
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,010
Harold, listen to me.

1249
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,620
I can't die right now.

1250
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,680
It's just really bad timing.

1251
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:13,630
No one wants to die, Harold,
but unfortunately we do.

1252
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,560
Harold...

1253
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,230
Harold, listen to me.

1254
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,470
Harold, you will die someday,
sometime.

1255
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,840
Heart failure at the bank.

1256
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,540
Choke on a mint.

1257
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,020
Some long, drawn-out disease
you contracted on vacation.

1258
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:37,750
You will die. You will absolutely die.

1259
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:42,050
Even if you avoid this death,
another will find you.

1260
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:48,100
And I guarantee that it won't be nearly
as poetic or meaningful...

1261
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,470
...as what she's written.

1262
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,640
I'm sorry...

1263
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,880
...but it's the nature of all tragedies,
Harold.

1264
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:04,380
The hero dies,
but the story lives on forever.

1265
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:47,340
- There's an empty seat right there.
- No, I wanna sit down over here.

1266
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,130
Kay?

1267
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,110
Kay?

1268
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,580
How many people
do you think I've killed?

1269
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,950
- Kay.
- How many?

1270
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,910
- I don't know.
- Eight.

1271
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:53,750
- Kay...
- I've killed eight people. I counted.

1272
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,120
They're fictional. Get up.

1273
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:58,300
Harold Crick isn't fictional.

1274
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,500
- I don't...
- He isn't fictional, Penny.

1275
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:06,790
Every book I've ever written ends
with someone dying. Every one.

1276
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,810
Really nice people too.

1277
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:13,970
The book about Helen
the schoolteacher.

1278
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:20,250
I killed her
the day before summer vacation.

1279
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,080
How cruel is that?

1280
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,920
And the civil engineer, Edward.

1281
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,560
The one I trapped...

1282
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:34,290
...with a heart attack in rush hour.

1283
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,330
I killed him.

1284
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,130
I killed...

1285
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,300
Penny, I killed them all.

1286
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,480
Miss Eiffel? Miss Eiffel?

1287
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,650
- Harold.
- Hi.

1288
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,280
- I just finished it.
- You just...

1289
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:29,320
Yeah, I read it all in one read
on the bus.

1290
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,850
It's lovely.

1291
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,300
I like the part about the guitars.

1292
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,130
Well, thanks, thanks. Goo...
Well, listen, I'm...

1293
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:43,900
No, I read it and I loved it.
And there's only one way it can end.

1294
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:48,440
I mean, I don't have much background
in literary anything...

1295
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,420
...but this seems simple enough.

1296
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:56,820
I love your book.
And I think you should finish it.

1297
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,170
<i>The night before his death...</i>

1298
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:20,660
<i>... Harold unsuspectingly went about
some usual business.</i>

1299
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,080
<i>He finished his outstanding audits.</i>

1300
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:28,450
<i>He made a few phone calls
he had been putting off.</i>

1301
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:32,250
Listen, does your program
have an age limit?

1302
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,430
<i>And he traveled to Ms Pascal's...</i>

1303
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,960
<i>... where she made him meat loaf
and chocolate pudding...</i>

1304
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,620
<i>... and the two watched old movies.</i>

1305
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,230
<i>It was a nice enough evening.</i>

1306
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:49,740
<i>And in any other circumstance
it would've seemed commonplace.</i>

1307
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:53,340
<i>In fact, the only thing
that made this night significant...</i>

1308
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,720
<i>... was the morning it preceded.</i>

1309
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:03,710
I have to tell you something.

1310
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,220
You do?

1311
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,780
I do.

1312
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,680
- Is it a secret?
- Sort of.

1313
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:13,380
Tell me.

1314
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,060
I adore you.

1315
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:22,360
I adore you too.

1316
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:28,510
- That it?
- No.

1317
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,510
I have to tell you this.

1318
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:34,310
I just want you to listen carefully.

1319
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,070
Okay.

1320
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,550
You can deduct the value
of all the food you give away...

1321
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,330
...as a charitable contribution.
- Harold.

1322
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:49,790
No, no, no. In fact it amounts to more
than what you're currently withholding.

1323
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,240
And it doesn't break any tax laws.

1324
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:56,560
Harold, the point
is to break the tax laws.

1325
01:33:56,770 --> 01:34:00,140
I wanna make the world
a better place too, Ana.

1326
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,270
I think that means
keeping you out of jail.

1327
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,740
Okay.

1328
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,910
Okay?

1329
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,590
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1330
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:17,450
If you come over here...

1331
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:21,860
...and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear.

1332
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,400
Because I like it so much.

1333
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:51,290
<i>Much had changed for Harold
over the past few weeks:</i>

1334
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,450
<i>His attitude towards work.</i>

1335
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,790
<i>His habitual counting.</i>

1336
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,850
<i>His love life.</i>

1337
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:05,600
<i>But of all the transmutations
Harold Crick had undergone...</i>

1338
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,810
<i>... perhaps the most significant
was that today on his return to work...</i>

1339
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:15,240
<i>... he was not late
for the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1340
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:19,810
<i>What Harold had not understood...</i>

1341
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:22,420
<i>... about that Wednesday
four weeks prior...</i>

1342
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:25,390
<i>... was that the time he received from
his fellow commuter...</i>

1343
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:29,320
<i>... was, in fact, three full minutes
later than the actual time...</i>

1344
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,830
<i>... and, therefore, three full minutes
later...</i>

1345
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:37,170
<i>... than the time to which his watch
and life had been previously set.</i>

1346
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,960
<i>Not the worst of errors.</i>

1347
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:44,870
<i>But if Harold had not set his watch
to the incorrect time...</i>

1348
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:49,080
<i>... Harold would have again
barely caught the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1349
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,410
<i>And he would not be approaching
the bus stop...</i>

1350
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,820
<i>... precisely at 8:14
this particular Friday.</i>

1351
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,280
Excuse me.

1352
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,950
Harold?

1353
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:05,700
<i>An otherwise ignorable fact...</i>

1354
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,630
<i>... until the unthinkable occurred.</i>

1355
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,760
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1356
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,870
I need for everyone
to just stay seated.

1357
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:47,390
Come on, son.

1358
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:55,340
- What happened? I didn't see him.
- It was not your fault.

1359
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,850
He was trying to help the boy.
Get your supervisor.

1360
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,230
I don't believe this.

1361
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,950
- It was all my fault, though.
- No, it wasn't.

1362
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,140
Is he okay?

1363
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:06,390
- It looks likes he's breathing.
- I don't think he's breathing.

1364
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,680
Oh, my God.

1365
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,800
Come in.

1366
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,570
Excuse me.

1367
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:34,580
Are you Professor Hilbert?

1368
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,720
Yes.

1369
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,450
Hi. I'm Karen Eiffel.

1370
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:47,660
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance.

1371
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,330
Please, sit down.

1372
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:54,790
No, I just came by to...

1373
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:57,240
Here.

1374
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:03,480
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1375
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:06,040
Have you read it?

1376
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,380
Is that all right?

1377
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,410
Yes.

1378
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,900
I think, perhaps, you may be
interested in the new ending.

1379
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:36,270
Good afternoon.

1380
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:38,940
Oh, hi.

1381
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,880
It's a pretty brave thing you did.

1382
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:48,060
Stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave.

1383
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:52,250
Kind of stupid, but pretty brave.

1384
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,190
Oh, yeah.

1385
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,760
Is that boy okay?

1386
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,340
He's just fine. Scratched up is all.

1387
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,030
Oh, good.

1388
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,030
Am I okay?

1389
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:07,840
Well, you're not dead.

1390
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,050
On the other hand, it looks like
you cracked your head...

1391
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,450
...you broke three bones
in your leg and foot...

1392
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:16,350
...you suffered four broken ribs,
fractured your left arm...

1393
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:20,460
...and severed an artery in your right,
which should've killed you in minutes.

1394
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,650
But amazingly...

1395
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:24,790
...a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery...

1396
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,930
...keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive...

1397
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,400
...which is pretty cool.

1398
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:33,110
Yeah.
So with some physical therapy...

1399
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,970
...a few months of rest,
you should be fine.

1400
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:39,610
Well, sort of. We weren't able
to remove the shard of watch...

1401
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:42,710
...from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage.

1402
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:45,210
You'll be okay.
You'll just have a piece of watch...

1403
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:48,120
...embedded in your arm
the rest of your life.

1404
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,950
You're very lucky to be alive,
Mr Crick.

1405
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:52,850
Yeah.

1406
01:40:57,090 --> 01:41:00,460
- Dr Mercator, Mr Crick has a visitor.
- Sure.

1407
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,020
- My God, Harold.
- Hey.

1408
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:10,500
- I'm okay. It's all right.
- Harold.

1409
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:12,200
I'm fine.

1410
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:15,000
Harold, you're not fine.

1411
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:18,610
Look at you. You're severely injured.

1412
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:21,780
- No, I'm fine.
- What...? What happened?

1413
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,790
I stepped in front of a bus.

1414
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:27,580
What? Why?

1415
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:31,420
There was a boy.
I had to push him out of the way.

1416
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:33,690
What?

1417
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,830
I had to keep this boy from getting hit.

1418
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,600
You stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy?

1419
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,330
I didn't have a choice.

1420
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,170
I had to.

1421
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,720
It's... It's okay.

1422
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,730
- It's not great.
- No.

1423
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:13,370
It's okay. It's not bad.

1424
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,340
It's not the most amazing piece
of English literature in several years...

1425
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,670
...but it's okay.

1426
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,710
You know...

1427
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,480
...I think I'm fine with "okay. "

1428
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:30,420
It doesn't make sense
with the rest of the book though.

1429
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,010
No, not yet. I'll rewrite the rest.

1430
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,760
My assistant said
she'd go back to the publisher...

1431
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,280
...and request more time.
- Why?

1432
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:40,600
Don't know. It's awfully sweet though.

1433
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,060
No, why did you change the book?

1434
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,020
Lots of reasons.

1435
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,970
I realized I just couldn't do it.

1436
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:53,240
Because he's real?

1437
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:56,540
Because it's a book about a man...

1438
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,950
...who doesn't know he's about to die
and then dies.

1439
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:03,840
But if the man does know
he's going to die and dies anyway...

1440
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:07,020
...dies willingly,
knowing he could stop it, then...

1441
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:12,120
I mean, isn't that the type of man
you want to keep alive?

1442
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,500
<i>As Harold took a bite
of Bavarian sugar cookie...</i>

1443
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:22,050
<i>... he finally felt as if everything
was going to be okay.</i>

1444
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:26,270
<i>Sometimes, when we lose ourselves
in fear and despair...</i>

1445
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:28,670
<i>... in routine and constancy...</i>

1446
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,150
<i>... in hopelessness and tragedy...</i>

1447
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:36,440
<i>... we can thank God
for Bavarian sugar cookies.</i>

1448
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,790
<i>And fortunately,
when there aren't any cookies...</i>

1449
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:44,800
<i>... we can still find reassurance
in a familiar hand on our skin...</i>

1450
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,300
<i>... or a kind and loving gesture...</i>

1451
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,910
<i>... or a subtle encouragement...</i>

1452
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,770
<i>... or a loving embrace...</i>

1453
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,880
<i>... or an offer of comfort.</i>

1454
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:09,380
<i>Not to mention hospital gurneys...</i>

1455
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:13,480
<i>... and nose plugs...</i>

1456
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,560
<i>... and uneaten Danish...</i>

1457
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,790
<i>... and soft-spoken secrets...</i>

1458
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,540
<i>... and Fender Stratocasters...</i>

1459
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:38,870
<i>... and maybe the occasional piece
of fiction.</i>

1460
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,480
<i>And we must remember
that all these things...</i>

1461
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,850
<i>... the nuances, the anomalies,
the subtleties...</i>

1462
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:47,120
<i>... which we assume
only accessorize our days...</i>

1463
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:51,680
<i>... are, in fact, here for a much larger
and nobler cause:</i>

1464
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,960
<i>They are here to save our lives.</i>

1465
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,190
<i>I know the idea seems strange.</i>

1466
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,690
<i>But I also know that it
just so happens to be true.</i>

1467
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:04,440
<i>And so it was:</i>

1468
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,210
<i>A wristwatch saved Harold Crick.</i>
