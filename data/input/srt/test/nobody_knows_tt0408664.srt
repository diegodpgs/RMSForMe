Although this film was inspired by
actual events that took place in Tokyo,

2
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,303
the details and characters portrayed

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,605
in this film are entirely fictional.

4
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,200
"NOBODY KNOWS"

5
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:17,006
"NOBODY KNOWS"

6
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,716
Hello.

7
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,579
We've just moved into 203.
We're the Fukushimas.

8
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,280
I wanted to meet the landlord.

9
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,455
- It's just a token gift.
- Thank you for taking the trouble.

10
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,220
It's very nice to meet you.

11
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,592
Um, my husband's abroad, you see...

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,998
so really, it's just the two of us.
I hope you'll look out for us.

13
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,104
Oh, I see.
Don't hesitate to ask.

14
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,934
Thank you very much.
Introduce yourself.

15
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,767
I'm Fukushima Akira.

16
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,640
- I see, are you in Jr. High?
- I'm in sixth grade.

17
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,781
You're so big!

18
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,850
Once you get to this age,
it's fine, but little ones...

19
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,351
well, other tenants tend
to complain about them.

20
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,525
Oh, he's very mature.
He'll be no trouble.

21
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,423
Fortunately,
he takes after his father,

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,598
and he's a really good student.

23
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,932
But now that he's in sixth grade,
he's ready to learn English...

24
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,614
Mother!

25
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,021
Hold on.

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,301
Shh!

27
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,335
In the back room,
please.

28
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,372
- The living room?
- Yes.

29
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,631
You just know
that landlord remarried.

30
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,733
His first wife,
I bet you his first wife died,

31
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,134
and he went
and married again.

32
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,706
- Just hold on, Shigeru.
- What is this?

33
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,212
Just hold on.

34
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,381
Here goes.

35
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,513
You OK?
Was it hot?

36
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,955
It's hot.

37
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,254
Wow, you did a great job.

38
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,759
It was hot.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,591
This is your new home.

40
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,429
Just hold on, Shigeru.

41
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,120
Shall we let Shigeru out?

42
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,632
I'll let you out.

43
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,665
Here comes the noisy boy.

44
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,139
Was it hot?

45
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,604
Super hot.

46
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,777
You did a great job.
We're here.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,344
OK!
A huge success.

48
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,547
What floor is this?

49
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,656
Our new home
is on the second floor.

50
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,985
Apartment 203.

51
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,032
Get back inside,
Shigeru.

52
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,464
What if they see you?

53
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,203
We'll have to move all over again.
Get inside.

54
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,099
Get in here! Hey, Akira.

55
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,974
Get back inside.

56
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,579
Shigeru, you've got to
unpack your own toys

57
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,619
I'll go pick up Kyoko at the station.

58
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,921
Be careful, off you go.
You know the way?

59
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,628
I know.

60
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,198
I'm off.

61
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,499
OK, off you go, then.

62
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,065
- Did you wait?
- You're late.

63
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,125
I'm sorry.
Is the apartment big?

64
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,312
Yeah, it's three rooms.
Pretty big.

65
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,904
The washing machine?

66
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,877
On the veranda.

67
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,910
The veranda, huh?

68
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,185
Kyoko!

69
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,546
We're home.

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,019
I think I know how
to make the soup.

71
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,384
I know how to make the soup.

72
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,651
OK, then, you make it.

73
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,359
Such big chopsticks!
Oh, I'll eat with these.

74
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,070
Yeah! My favorite!

75
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,605
Tasty?

76
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,005
May I have
everyone's attention?

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,641
Now that we've moved
into a new home,

78
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,146
I'm going to explain the rules to you,
one more time.

79
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,946
Let's promise to keep them, OK?

80
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,826
How many are there?

81
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:12,055
OK, first of all,
no loud voices or screaming.

82
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,566
- Can you do that?
- I can.

83
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,704
Next, no going outside.

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,436
I know.

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,507
Can you do that?
Not even out on the veranda.

86
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,339
OK?
Can you keep that promise?

87
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,747
Sure!

88
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,978
Can you do it,
little Shige-monster?

89
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,288
You're the one
that has to promise hardest.

90
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,786
Absolutely no going outside.
Can you do that?

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,654
Bet you can-can.

92
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,799
He didn't raise his hand.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,968
That's right,
remember our old home,

94
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,731
we had to leave because
you always threw such tantrums.

95
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,740
So, now that we've found
a nice new home,

96
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,674
you've got to promise.
Can you?

97
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,508
How's Kyoko supposed
to do the laundry?

98
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,952
For the laundry,

99
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,381
there's no choice,
but for Kyoko

100
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,386
to sneak out
quietly for the laundry.

101
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,688
Don't go out with her, Shigeru.

102
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,258
And Akira,
you already know all this,

103
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,528
but Mom's sometimes late,
so you'll be in charge.

104
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:30,206
That's OK, right?
And study a lot.

105
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,637
You really have to get it, Shigeru.

106
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,873
Do you get it?

107
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,085
If you don't...
It's an enema for you!

108
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,415
Not an enema,
green peppers.

109
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,891
Green peppers?

110
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,192
Why!

111
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,558
Make him eat peppers.

112
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,354
Oh, that's it, then.

113
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,191
We'll give Shigeru
"The Pepper Punishment," got that?

114
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,760
Next time you're up for a tantrum
get in the suitcase.

115
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,729
Shut up!

116
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,240
Like I...

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,899
That's the time to climb in.

118
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,577
That's right, that's right.

119
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,303
What a great idea!

120
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,811
Put him there when he's noisy, OK?

121
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,506
We'll all put him in.

122
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,927
Mother.

123
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,426
These tatami
mats smell good.

124
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,001
The tatami?
What do they smell like?

125
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,805
Like leaves in nature.

126
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,735
That's a nice smell, isn't it?

127
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,044
The tatami are still new,
they're still green.

128
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,015
Make you sleep well?

129
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,547
Good night.

130
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,371
- Will you be late?
- Today? Let's see...

131
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,880
What's today?
Oh, I guess I might...

132
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,781
Maybe I'll be late.

133
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,717
You want dinner?

134
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,751
Dinner... dinner...
What's for dinner tonight?

135
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,362
Maybe curry.

136
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,921
Curry? I want curry!
Save me some curry.

137
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,767
Please.

138
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,168
Maybe I'll eat it.

139
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,273
Off you go.

140
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,617
Hey, did Mom leave already?

141
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,345
She just left.

142
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,093
Dangerous.

143
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,990
The piano...

144
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,362
- I'm going shopping.
- Off you go.

145
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,399
Get me an "Apollo Choco".

146
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,075
OK.

147
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,843
150 yen.

148
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,324
Shall I buy persimmons?

149
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,998
No "Chocolate Apollo".

150
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:33,311
There's a video arcade...
"Inageya Hardwares store".

151
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,284
"Near and far-sighted... "

152
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,016
Found it.

153
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,690
Apollo Choco

154
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,293
No bag, right?

155
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,694
Out of 100 Yen, then.

156
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,108
Thank you very much.

157
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,490
Save 'em for later...

158
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,320
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

159
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,043
- The bath's ready, brother.
- You can go first.

160
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,550
OK.

161
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,831
- Are there carrots?
- There are carrots.

162
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,369
None for me.

163
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,335
No, you have to eat them.

164
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,315
Dinner's ready, Kyoko.

165
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,985
OK.

166
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,374
Shigeru left the carrots, again.

167
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,730
Elementary Japanese

168
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,351
Look, Mother's home.

169
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,643
Hey there, I'm back.

170
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,651
Welcome home.

171
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,523
It's damned cold out there.
Warm in here.

172
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,524
Weren't you in bed, yet?

173
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,253
I was hanging the laundry.

174
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,797
What a good girl.
Thank you.

175
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,499
And what do we have here?

176
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,168
Can I have some?

177
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,875
Damn, it's cold!

178
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,841
- Welcome home.
- I'm home.

179
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,743
- Ops.
- Got it?

180
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,118
- I can't.
- No way.

181
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,683
It clicked but went out.

182
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,620
All yours.

183
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,419
Did I get this right?

184
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,757
What's this?

185
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,163
"A nation that flourished,

186
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,465
in about 300 C.C."

187
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,105
What don't you understand?

188
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,639
I just wondered
if I got it right.

189
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,842
No, it should be "300 B.C.".

190
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:40,417
When you don't know,
you look it up in here.

191
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,815
That way, you'll learn.

192
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,926
Wow, is this Shigeru's?

193
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,853
Wow, what's this?

194
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,227
This yours? Kyoko's?

195
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,964
I hate math...

196
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,864
Six times six is...

197
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,975
Six-six, six-six...

198
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:14,080
Hurry. Six-six.

199
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,987
I can do it.

200
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,522
Six-six is thirty-six...

201
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,265
Hello, yes.

202
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,705
It's noisy there.
Awful noisy.

203
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,775
Where are you?
Karaoke?

204
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,179
Not now,
it's too late.

205
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:51,489
What? Who's there?
Oh, really, what a shame...

206
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,079
And-a 2...

207
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,081
And-a, and-a 3

208
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,587
Hey, oh no.

209
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,646
And-a 1, hey.

210
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,317
And-a 3.

211
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,392
And-a, and-a 4.

212
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,322
Oh, me? And-a, and-a 2.

213
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,437
Oh, no, I'm the loser.
Who has to go without dinner!

214
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,834
You won't get sleepy.

215
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,946
If there's no lid on,
what could be inside?

216
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,174
You can't tell.

217
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:29,480
See, if you close your eyes
and put it in,

218
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,816
if you put it
in but you don't know...

219
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,174
Mother.

220
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,179
I want to go to school.

221
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:01,118
School? You wouldn't
have any fun at school.

222
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,713
Besides,
when you don't have a Daddy,

223
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,087
they bully you at school.

224
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,358
You don't need
to go to school.

225
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:21,563
Wow, feels really great.
Great smell, did you smell it?

226
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,467
Stinks of sunlight.

227
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,537
Stinks of sunlight?

228
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,647
Stinks of sunlight,
what a beautiful day...

229
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,725
Your mother,

230
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,257
is in love with someone now.

231
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,764
Again?

232
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,735
Not again.

233
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,609
This guy's really sweet
and serious.

234
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,638
I think he's really
looking out for me.

235
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:09,343
So, if he promises to really...

236
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,317
to really marry me,

237
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:18,428
then we can all
live in a big house

238
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,223
and you can all go to school

239
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,730
and Kyoko can play the piano...

240
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,961
So just hang on
a little longer.

241
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,098
I really think this time probably...

242
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,741
I'm home.

243
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,548
I'm home.

244
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,177
Here we are, sushi.

245
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,990
I'm home, meow.

246
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,655
Were you asleep?

247
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:59,558
C'mon, c'mon guys,
the sushi was a present.

248
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,732
A sushi present.
C'mon, c'mon.

249
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,065
You wake up?

250
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,807
You wake up?
You mad?

251
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,507
C'mon over, come over,
c'mon over, Yuki.

252
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,808
She stinks of booze.

253
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:20,076
Aren't you cold?
Were you asleep? I'm sorry.

254
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,150
It's just that your Mommy
had a pretty good time today.

255
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,024
- Here you are, Mom.
- Oh, thank you.

256
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,317
Akira.

257
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,150
Listen, Akira...

258
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,854
he's starting to look
just like his father.

259
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:05,194
He's got his father's
eyes, exactly.

260
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,863
You brother's father...

261
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,500
used to work at Haneda.

262
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:19,006
You know what Haneda is?
It's a place with lots of airplanes.

263
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:23,443
You know, right, Shigeru?
That's where he used to work.

264
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,852
Oh, I know, listen, Akira.

265
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,949
Remember going
to see your father?

266
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,458
I don't.

267
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,792
We took the Monorail
to get to Haneda Airport.

268
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,890
You forget?

269
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,568
Yeah.

270
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,300
Kyoko, your father was...

271
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,607
a music producer.

272
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:56,373
I know! Let's give
Kyoko's pretty hands...

273
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,109
a nice manicure.

274
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,917
Your mother, actually...

275
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:14,193
I wanted to be a singer.

276
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,028
And I really made it,
part way.

277
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,929
With your father, Kyoko.

278
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,469
Oops, way too much.

279
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,775
I was going to cut a record.

280
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,716
And we were almost ready...

281
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,215
when the deal fell apart.

282
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,721
Your mother really
wanted to, but...

283
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,468
Dear Akira, Your mother's
going away for a little while.

284
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,772
Please look after Kyoko,
Shigeru and Yuki.

285
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,529
I'm going shopping.

286
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,030
Sure, off you go, then.

287
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,066
And also, mother won't be
coming back for a while.

288
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,360
Why not?

289
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,596
Something to do with work, I think
I'm off.

290
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,107
Off you go.

291
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:44,639
Indicate the account number
for your transfer.

292
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,757
The rent...
electricity bill, phone and gas...

293
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,888
And also...

294
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,896
tissues...

295
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,860
Let's go to my office.

296
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,267
Do you always do this?

297
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,642
No, I don't.

298
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,074
Your first time?

299
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,848
I didn't take anything.

300
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:34,008
Then what's all
this doing here?

301
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,889
Your name?

302
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,056
Fukushima Akira.

303
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,923
Fukushima... Akira...

304
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,133
School?

305
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,866
Your father's name?

306
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,699
I don't have a father.

307
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,440
No father?

308
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,878
Your mother, then?

309
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:05,614
She's gone away to work for a while.

310
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,950
Where did she go?

311
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,318
If you won't tell me,
I'll have to call the police.

312
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,958
Sir,

313
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,853
I don't think this boy stole that.

314
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,328
I think the boys reading comics
over there put them in his bag.

315
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,067
It wasn't him?

316
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,135
No, I don't think so.

317
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,773
- Why didn't you speak up?
- I'm sorry.

318
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,709
Don't "I'm sorry," me!

319
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,286
This is just between us, OK?
The meat buns are a little bonus.

320
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,631
Hurry, give it to him.

321
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,265
Thank you very much.

322
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,607
- Is that a plus sign?
- That's right.

323
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,684
9,824 Yen.

324
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,585
9,824 Yen?

325
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,028
I forgot to add this.

326
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,171
Hello.

327
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,090
Isn't this your day off?

328
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,528
I'm driving again tonight.
No use staying home.

329
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,094
How's your Mom?

330
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,458
She hasn't been home in a month.

331
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,958
For real?

332
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,307
- How old are you, Akira?
- I'm 12.

333
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,740
And Yuki?

334
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,883
Yuki's fine.

335
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,313
She take after me?

336
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,585
Yes, she does.

337
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,423
For real...

338
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,006
Akira!

339
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,569
Shit, I'm 10 Yen short.
Lend me 10 Yen.

340
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,514
What, 10 Yen?

341
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,380
Why discuss it so much for 10 Yen?

342
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,449
What's with that
damned big wallet?

343
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,553
It's a hand-me-down,
from my mother.

344
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,382
- From who?
- From my mother.

345
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,058
You moved, right?

346
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,989
The new place big?

347
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,426
- Any pubic hair, yet?
- No...

348
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,332
- Liar, I got mine in 5th grade.
- No way.

349
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,333
That's the truth.

350
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,279
It's just...

351
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,143
What are you smirking about?

352
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,810
It's just that since mother's gone,

353
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:27,148
it's just, there's no money.

354
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,156
For real?
I don't have any money.

355
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,686
What've you got left?

356
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,794
- About 10,000 Yen.
- 10,000 Yen is enough.

357
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,704
I'm in a helluvajam, myself.

358
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,503
My girlfriend, you know,

359
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,976
she totally maxed
out my credit cards.

360
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,340
I'm in credit card hell, man.

361
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,507
So I'm working my ass off,
slowly paying it down, man.

362
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,960
This is all I've got on me.
This is it, the last time.

363
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,734
Thank you.

364
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,698
All right, I'm off.

365
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,767
By the way,
Yuki's not my kid.

366
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:22,072
Every time I did it with your mom,
I used a condom. Bye, then.

367
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,647
Bye, then.

368
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,845
Thanks for this.

369
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,048
Bye.

370
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,153
Oh, no, I'm hopeless.

371
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,524
I need to get in.

372
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,104
So cold...

373
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:06,452
I spent 674 Yen
at the supermarket.

374
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:10,159
I have 650 Yen
left in my wallet.

375
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,697
How many Yen were in my wallet
to begin with?

376
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,870
"Soon, I came across Bubu the Pig,
planting turnip seeds in a field"

377
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,603
"What a nice bag you have there".

378
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,645
"My mother made it for me".

379
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,393
"Where, where, where is it?"

380
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,038
You can't go out,
Shigeru.

381
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,938
I'm not out.

382
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,771
I'm not out.

383
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,151
I'm home!

384
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,287
Welcome home.

385
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,381
How've you guys been?

386
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,556
Hey, how've you guys been?

387
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,390
See, I'm home.

388
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,565
Look, presents.
This one's for Yuki.

389
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,069
Thank you.

390
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,295
For you, Shigeru.

391
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,841
I'm home.

392
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,802
Akira, Akira.

393
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,850
Wow, it's been a while.

394
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:45,084
Shall I open it for you?

395
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:50,092
You can carry it on your back!

396
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:53,223
Wow! It's cute.

397
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,127
Carry it? Carry it?
Like a backpack.

398
00:43:56,334 --> 00:44:00,168
You can put your things inside,
and do that...

399
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,333
The sides? Your ears?
Out?

400
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,511
Ears out?

401
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:15,315
You look so neat.
He looks better with short hair.

402
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,052
Which is more becoming, Yuki?
Long or...

403
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,456
Long.

404
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:23,587
You like him better with long hair?
Oh, no, but I'll cut it anyway.

405
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,054
A little bit shorter's OK, right?

406
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,961
What's that face for?

407
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,573
Don't tell me,
I cut your bangs too short.

408
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,403
You're fine, right?
Too short?

409
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,374
I don't believe it.

410
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,411
Anyway, it'll grow right back out.

411
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,982
Don't act so cool.

412
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,653
You look cute.

413
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,221
I mean it.

414
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,289
Here goes!

415
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,361
Maribo!

416
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,358
A chop! The pits!

417
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,673
Chop Maribo!

418
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,508
Maribo!

419
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,072
Maribo!

420
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,572
Hey, what are you doing?
Kyoko.

421
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,875
What are you doing?
Don't touch my things.

422
00:45:56,821 --> 00:46:01,258
It's your fault.
It won't come out...

423
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,625
Where were you,
really, Mother?

424
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,362
I told you
I was working.

425
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,967
A whole month?

426
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,570
I was in Osaka.
It was just too far.

427
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,372
I told you not
to touch my things.

428
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,982
What are you doing?

429
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,953
You see, today,

430
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,652
your mother has to step out,
so I'm getting ready.

431
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,422
You're going already?

432
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,932
Your mother's... busy today.

433
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,237
But listen,
I'll be back for Christmas.

434
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,541
Only 5,000 Yen?

435
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:39,982
He could've lent you a little more,
I mean, you're little kids in ajam.

436
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,225
But hey, pachinko parlors and taxis,

437
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,453
don't draw customers
in such hard times.

438
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,829
But you go back to him
if you need to.

439
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,298
It's cold.

440
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,277
And the wind's blowing so hard.
It's so cold...

441
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:07,148
Did you tell the man
you're seeing about us?

442
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,221
I told you, I'll tell him eventually...

443
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,016
Sugar.

444
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,982
You've got sugar there.

445
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,889
God,
you're irritating.

446
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,858
Listen, I keep asking you,

447
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,201
when will you let us
go to school?

448
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,736
What's this
"school this, school that"?

449
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,805
Who needs to go to school, anyway?

450
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,443
Plenty of famous people never
even went to school in the first place.

451
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,476
Like who?

452
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:14,178
How should I know?
But plenty of them...

453
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,655
You're so selfish, mother.

454
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,386
How can you say that?

455
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:25,760
Selfish? You want to know
who's really selfish?

456
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,296
Your father's the one who's selfish,
up and disappearing like that.

457
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,767
What is this?
I'm not allowed to be happy?

458
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,774
What is this?

459
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,725
Oh, I know someone famous.

460
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,731
Prime Minister Tanaka.
Ever heard of him?

461
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,237
Never.

462
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,102
You're too young.

463
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,939
How about...
the wrestler Antonio Inoki?

464
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:18,076
I bet he never went to school.
I'm not sure, but...

465
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:19,909
Sure, he did.

466
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,983
Man, you're a drag.
Hurry up and finish eating.

467
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,057
I'll send you money, soon.

468
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,000
- You'll come home for Christmas?
- Sure, I'll come home.

469
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:44,334
I'll be right home.
You take care, of them, too.

470
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,880
Is Totoro really real?

471
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,353
Don't you know
how big Totoro is?

472
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,728
I know.

473
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,287
I know, he's really big.

474
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:17,429
It'd be a real mess
if he was walking around.

475
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,499
The police would've catched him.

476
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,071
- Think there are UFOs?
- Nope.

477
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,303
If Martians exist,
so do UFOs.

478
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,974
Martians are...

479
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,744
What about real Zombies?
Scary Zombies.

480
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,014
You think Santa Claus is real?

481
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,756
He is. He is.

482
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,895
You think?
There's only one Santa, right?

483
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,763
He can't coverJapan
all by himself, can he?

484
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:57,907
But he can.
Santa Claus can manage it.

485
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,269
That's right, there are all kinds...

486
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,176
Mother didn't come back, did she?

487
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:52,485
Her work kept her
away longer.

488
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,655
Because I was so mean to Mom?

489
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,555
No, that's not true.

490
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,335
Hello, this is
the Sanwa Department Store.

491
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,697
May I speak to Fukushima Keiko
in Menswear?

492
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,536
- Excuse me...
- This is her son.

493
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,769
Please hold a moment.

494
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:03,658
I'm terribly sorry, but Ms. Fukushima
resigned last month.

495
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,255
How may I help you?

496
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,577
- How many minutes, Shigeru?
- Not yet.

497
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,052
Not yet...
how many more minutes?

498
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,659
One more minute, maybe.

499
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,396
Maybe?

500
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,064
Not ready yet?

501
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,508
It's about ready, I think.

502
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,271
You think?

503
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,305
Let's eat, then.

504
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,877
Thanks for the food.

505
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,520
Off you go, then.

506
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,519
Thanks for the food.

507
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,687
I have to lick the lid.

508
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:29,174
- Taste good?
- Tastes good.

509
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,937
The super-duper best.

510
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,524
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a phone number.

511
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:20,192
Kanagawa Prefecture,
Kawasaki City, Nakahara Ku...

512
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:39,348
Hello, this is the Yamamotos.

513
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,817
Hello... Hello?

514
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,754
- Wonder who this is?
- They aren't talking...

515
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,797
Good evening
Have a happy new year.

516
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,769
Kyoko's next.

517
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,502
With the "kyo" like in Tokyo.

518
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:25,154
Akira.

519
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,662
That's right...

520
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,992
Mom sent us all
New Year's presents.

521
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,933
Look.

522
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:41,095
- For you, Yuki.
- Thank you.

523
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,604
Shigeru.

524
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,039
Kyoko.

525
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:47,843
- That's for you.
- Thanks.

526
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,114
4,000 Yen!

527
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:56,708
4,000 Yen! No way
It's 2,000 Yen.

528
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,917
1,000 Yen.

529
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,422
4,000 Yen.

530
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,954
4,000 Yen.

531
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:08,894
- What do you want, Yuki?
- A doll.

532
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,398
- Shigeru?
- Roller blades.

533
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:14,937
Roller blades?

534
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,275
You, Kyoko?

535
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:22,604
I'm saving mine
up for a piano.

536
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:24,746
You, brother?

537
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,811
A baseball glove.

538
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,149
No, I'm gonna meet
Mommy at the station.

539
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,919
She's not coming home today.

540
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,214
I'm sure
she's coming home.

541
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,183
She'll be back next week.

542
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,990
She's really coming next week?

543
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,663
She really will.

544
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,332
- How do you know?
- I just do.

545
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,006
She's coming home next week.

546
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,181
It's Yuki's birthday, today.

547
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,906
These?

548
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,653
- These?
- Yeah.

549
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,803
Just hang on.

550
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,645
OK, let's go.

551
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,560
Good evening.

552
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,028
Good evening.

553
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,329
Stepping out?

554
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,098
Where to?

555
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,258
To the station
to meet my Mommy.

556
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,993
I see, what's your name?

557
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,504
Yuki.

558
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,973
Yuki, I see.
How old are you, Yuki?

559
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,508
I'm 5.

560
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,338
5 years old? I see.

561
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,608
She's our cousin,
just staying overnight.

562
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,407
Oh, I see... Off you go, then.

563
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:15,682
Off we go, then.

564
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:19,949
Adorable little girl.

565
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:25,352
Tomato, daikon, broccoli,
squash, carrot...

566
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,289
mushrooms...

567
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,105
Plates... Cups...

568
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,337
The butcher's...

569
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,507
Oh, only one left?

570
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,471
The last one.

571
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,695
There's the monorail.

572
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,845
It goes to Haneda Airport.

573
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:11,026
Someday, let's get on
and go see the airplanes.

574
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,522
Yeah, let's do that.

575
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,191
Dear Kyoko.

576
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,462
To Kyoko.

577
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,031
No, no, it turns on
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, idiot.

578
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,139
No, no, it's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

579
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,036
No, I swear it's on 5.

580
01:11:20,243 --> 01:11:22,507
No, I swear it's 6.

581
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,813
Listen, listen, man.

582
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,380
You couldn't even do it
on that #Kamehama# thing.

583
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,243
Yes I could.

584
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,984
Go! No, that's too far-ish.

585
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,420
Oh, damn you did it.

586
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,626
You're a genius, man.

587
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,990
- Using the brake?
- No brake.

588
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,824
Hey, wow, cool!

589
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:49,505
You gotta crash it.

590
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:55,073
That one already burned...

591
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,104
Welcome.

592
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,155
Your friends?

593
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,985
Yeah, friends.

594
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,319
That's 197 Yen.

595
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:22,795
Get off, get off.

596
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,741
Thanks.

597
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,706
Let's go.

598
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,641
Bye, then.

599
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,582
Thank you.

600
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,919
See you tomorrow.
Bye, then.

601
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,352
Indicate the amount
of your transfer.

602
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:57,059
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

603
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:05,203
This one, huh?
Let's do it, let's do it.

604
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:09,505
Are you ready?
Start!

605
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,911
All right, perfect, max.

606
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,587
What?

607
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,758
Take that!

608
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,791
How quaint hair!

609
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:29,397
Coke and what?

610
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,263
Coke and orange and...
CC Lemon.

611
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,343
- I'm home. We bought stuff.
- You're late.

612
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,343
How far'd you go?

613
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,474
- Coke for me.
- Me, too.

614
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,046
Hey, somebody attacked.

615
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,522
Hey, you jerk,
you let 'em in.

616
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,660
But this person attacked.

617
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:03,597
Your Gas Bill is Overdue.

618
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,866
Get away, you jerk.

619
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,635
OK, nice.

620
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,314
Go away.

621
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,028
Told you so, dammit.

622
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:38,791
You'll never get
it that way.

623
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,301
Butt out.

624
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:58,318
- Let's go to the store, Akira.
- I'm hungry, treat us.

625
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,821
Sure.

626
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,989
Hey, I wanna go, too.

627
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,151
No, you stay home.
Don't touch the game.

628
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,725
Don't touch it.

629
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,264
What are you doing?

630
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,901
Hey, hey, hey, isn't this great?

631
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:59,040
Her tits are huge.
Great, huh?

632
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,850
Isn't it great?

633
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,859
You swipe it?

634
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,304
Your turn, Akira.

635
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:31,207
We're friends, right? Go.

636
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:36,710
Let's go.

637
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:48,262
Hey, wait.

638
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,137
He's not your type?

639
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,469
No way! He's way too passionate-like.
I like a cool-like guy.

640
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:45,037
But that's what's so cool.

641
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:46,481
Been a while.

642
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:48,746
How you been?

643
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:51,885
Yeah, fine.

644
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:57,085
They're too big for me.
They don't fit.

645
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:01,461
Mom says I'll grow anyway,
so take the big ones.

646
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,721
I hate 'em.

647
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,528
Hey been a while.
How you been? What's up?

648
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,741
I bought a new game,
why don't you come over?

649
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,547
I'll come over when I have time.

650
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,120
See you 'round.

651
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:31,015
I've got cram school, sorry.

652
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,885
- See ya.
- See ya, then.

653
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,024
Who was that?

654
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,261
Take me along to play.

655
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,235
Yeah, but his house stinks.

656
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,909
No way, stinks of what?

657
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:52,110
Stinks of garbage.
The place is a real mess.

658
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:53,941
Like rotting?

659
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:58,780
Here she comes.

660
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:56,604
To Mizuguchi Saki in Heaven.

661
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,400
Got it.

662
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,623
Hello, there, Fukushima san.

663
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:41,944
Don't worry, he's gone.

664
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,557
- How old are you?
- I'm 12.

665
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:02,064
You can't start working part-time
until you're 16.

666
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,438
Shouldn't you contact the police,
or child welfare, or something?

667
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,981
If I do, the four of us
won't be able to stay together.

668
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:18,748
That happened before
and it was an awful mess.

669
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,455
I see...

670
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:06,325
You need it for your piano.

671
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,370
It's OK.

672
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,272
Let's race.

673
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:04,851
Don't beat me, Akira.

674
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,751
Welcome.

675
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,454
Did your mother come back?

676
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:59,430
Who's taller?
We're the same.

677
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:54,052
There are seeds here, too.

678
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:58,532
- Really?
- Take them.

679
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,428
I'll take these, too.

680
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:03,763
OK, I'll take these.
Look, Akira, seeds.

681
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:07,404
Somebody just left them behind.

682
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,708
Poor things.

683
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:18,985
2, 3, 4, 5...

684
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,851
Amazing, for real.

685
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,515
Paper, scissors, rock!

686
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,060
First is rock!

687
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,353
Paper, scissors, rock!

688
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:33,433
I can't stop.

689
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:53,082
Akira, got dirt?

690
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:54,788
Got it.

691
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,732
Shige!

692
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,144
Shigeru!

693
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:53,947
Shigeru.

694
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,643
Hey, Shigeru.

695
01:30:58,186 --> 01:30:59,551
The bag.

696
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:23,870
It came out funny.

697
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,451
Yu...

698
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:37,891
Ki...

699
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:45,157
I'll go get some water.

700
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,947
Brother, the lights don't work.

701
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:27,266
Not in the bathroom, either.

702
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,852
Mr. String, Mr. String,
where are you?

703
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:27,360
What are you doing?

704
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:31,860
Not going to school?

705
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,467
No...

706
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,292
I'm not either.

707
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:50,713
There's a cicada hole here,
did you know?

708
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,646
No, I didn't.

709
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,418
And again.

710
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:04,296
Pi-ne-ap-p-l-e.

711
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,236
First is rock,
Paper, scissors, rock.

712
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:17,409
Ch-o-co-la-t-e.

713
01:35:17,946 --> 01:35:19,379
First is rock...

714
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:21,374
Paper, scissors, rock.

715
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,350
And again!

716
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:21,034
We have suspended
your water service.

717
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:22,762
I took so many!

718
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:25,364
That's Amazing!

719
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:46,181
What are you doing?

720
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:48,552
Nothing special.

721
01:38:50,358 --> 01:38:52,417
Did you catch cold?

722
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:55,596
Your voice sounds weird.

723
01:38:55,631 --> 01:38:56,995
Shut up.

724
01:39:18,386 --> 01:39:20,115
Are you washing your hair?

725
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:23,354
Yesterday, at the park.

726
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:48,306
Nice and cool?

727
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,995
When's your mother coming back?

728
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,495
She's never coming back.

729
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:10,937
Probably.

730
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:26,547
- I'm not hot.
- I'm hot.

731
01:41:30,518 --> 01:41:32,816
I said:
"I'm not hot, I'm not"

732
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,890
Thank you.

733
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:08,578
Eat the inari sushi first.

734
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:17,597
Shigeru.

735
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:23,836
No salmon?

736
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,771
No, just what's there.

737
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,630
No fair.

738
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:49,762
This was Shigeru's.
It died.

739
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:11,484
She fell asleep.

740
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:28,234
Excuse me,
the door was unlocked...

741
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,837
I'm the landlord from the 3rd floor,
here about the rent.

742
01:43:36,811 --> 01:43:38,506
Where's your mother?

743
01:43:39,346 --> 01:43:42,281
She's working in Osaka.

744
01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:47,578
Are you cousins?

745
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:29,287
- I'll go make some money.
- What? How?

746
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:36,657
- Here!
- No.

747
01:45:37,298 --> 01:45:39,994
Why not?
I just sang karaoke with him.

748
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:41,834
No!

749
01:47:17,965 --> 01:47:19,660
What are you eating?

750
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:22,068
Spit it out.

751
01:47:26,707 --> 01:47:28,007
What is that?

752
01:47:30,945 --> 01:47:32,245
Paper.

753
01:47:44,525 --> 01:47:46,459
That's 287 Yen.

754
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:55,060
Exactly, thank you.

755
01:47:57,438 --> 01:47:58,996
How'd the semester go?

756
01:47:59,206 --> 01:48:03,108
His report card, you mean?
A total disaster.

757
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:07,106
He got a terrible grade
in Japanese.

758
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:09,745
My child did badly, too.

759
01:48:31,472 --> 01:48:33,633
Wish I could find something.

760
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,160
Hey, where's Shigeru?

761
01:49:03,771 --> 01:49:05,170
Dunno.

762
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:16,713
What are you doing?

763
01:49:17,518 --> 01:49:18,818
Where's Shigeru?

764
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:20,511
Dunno.

765
01:49:54,288 --> 01:49:55,588
Shige!

766
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:00,689
You said you wanted noodles,
so I got some!

767
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:02,559
What do you want!

768
01:50:02,594 --> 01:50:04,224
You watch it, buster.

769
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:07,448
Don't bother coming home.

770
01:50:07,483 --> 01:50:09,565
Don't take it
out on things.

771
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,335
Did it break?

772
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,014
Amazing power!

773
01:50:23,217 --> 01:50:24,775
He's just an idiot.

774
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,684
Cut it out, Yuki.

775
01:52:48,862 --> 01:52:50,489
I have to pee.

776
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:54,022
Why didn't you pee
in the park, before?

777
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:57,300
Go pee by the bath.

778
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,705
Don't want to.

779
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,777
Is Saki coming back?

780
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:32,333
Shigeru! You can't just
use up all the water!

781
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:35,236
There's none left to drink.

782
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:44,518
Is Saki coming to play again?

783
01:53:44,553 --> 01:53:46,076
Never.

784
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:09,768
What are you doing?

785
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:12,776
I'm selling these.

786
01:54:14,948 --> 01:54:16,506
Don't need 'em anymore.

787
01:54:17,384 --> 01:54:18,684
Stop it.

788
01:54:19,086 --> 01:54:20,252
Cut it out.

789
01:54:20,253 --> 01:54:21,454
Let go!

790
01:54:21,455 --> 01:54:22,621
Shut up!

791
01:54:22,622 --> 01:54:24,317
- Give me that.
- Move.

792
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,788
Don't touch it!

793
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,295
She's never coming back.

794
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:42,300
Who cares! Stay in there!
Idiot!

795
01:55:25,886 --> 01:55:29,413
Miyauchi!
Don't move your legs too much!

796
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:43,566
Kato!
Where's Yano today?

797
01:55:44,171 --> 01:55:45,471
Cram school.

798
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:49,438
Cram school?
Oh, man, we're short.

799
01:56:04,057 --> 01:56:05,684
What year are you?

800
01:56:12,499 --> 01:56:14,091
Akira, number 9, right field.

801
01:56:20,407 --> 01:56:21,707
Line up!

802
01:56:30,116 --> 01:56:34,610
We're starting a game between the
White Bears and the Kenzan Fighters.

803
01:56:35,055 --> 01:56:36,355
Let's go!

804
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:37,990
Bow.

805
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,982
Let's go!

806
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:27,332
Akira, hold your hands closer,
like this...

807
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:32,511
When the ball comes,
take a real hard slice at it, wham!

808
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:34,407
Just, wham, swing at it.

809
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,024
That's fine,
nice swing...

810
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:49,423
"A big, big,
homerun, homerun"

811
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,722
"In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma... "

812
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:01,700
Yuki.

813
01:59:02,669 --> 01:59:03,969
Yuki won't get up.

814
01:59:06,406 --> 01:59:07,873
Yuki!

815
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,701
She fell off the chair.

816
01:59:22,422 --> 01:59:23,722
Yes, hello?

817
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,755
Is Fukushima Keiko there?

818
01:59:26,126 --> 01:59:27,889
Just a minute,
I'll go get her.

819
02:00:41,367 --> 02:00:45,360
Mommy

820
02:01:38,825 --> 02:01:42,659
A big, big

821
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:46,228
Homerun

822
02:01:47,267 --> 02:01:51,795
In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma

823
02:01:53,273 --> 02:01:55,241
So surprised...

824
02:01:56,943 --> 02:02:01,710
A big homerun
In heaven

825
02:02:02,816 --> 02:02:04,283
Akira.

826
02:02:35,081 --> 02:02:36,673
What happened?

827
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:48,860
That money...
Can I borrow it?

828
02:02:51,364 --> 02:02:54,026
I want to show Yuki...
the airplanes.

829
02:03:07,347 --> 02:03:09,474
You all off for a picnic?
Looks like fun!

830
02:03:12,752 --> 02:03:15,312
That'll be 1,895 Yen.

831
02:03:18,892 --> 02:03:20,519
OK, thanks.

832
02:03:51,824 --> 02:03:53,519
Kyoko, what's this?

833
02:03:54,527 --> 02:03:56,051
It just arrived.

834
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:15,542
To Akira, give them my best
I'm counting on you, Mother.

835
02:04:46,045 --> 02:04:47,535
She doesn't fit.

836
02:04:50,183 --> 02:04:52,014
Guess Yuki... grew.

837
02:06:08,761 --> 02:06:10,228
Is it good bye?

838
02:10:50,609 --> 02:10:53,407
When I touched Yuki
this morning...

839
02:10:55,448 --> 02:10:57,473
she was so cold,
it was awful.

840
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:06,552
It just felt so...

841
02:11:10,096 --> 02:11:12,257
It was just so...

842
02:12:39,018 --> 02:12:44,285
When I ask the midnight sky

843
02:12:46,425 --> 02:12:51,692
the stars just shine

844
02:12:54,300 --> 02:13:00,200
Into the black lake
of my molten heart

845
02:13:02,408 --> 02:13:07,402
I can only flow

846
02:13:10,216 --> 02:13:15,620
Will the angel even give me
a backward glance?

847
02:13:17,656 --> 02:13:23,117
Want to splash around in my heart?

848
02:13:25,498 --> 02:13:31,300
The winds of the coming winter
lap at the waves

849
02:13:33,105 --> 02:13:38,600
calling me into the dark

850
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:46,579
With eyes as wilted as ice

851
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:53,653
I'm growing up

852
02:13:55,427 --> 02:14:01,327
A jewel pungent with a stench

853
02:14:03,002 --> 02:14:08,902
that brooks no one's approach

854
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:07,765
Thanks.

855
02:16:29,415 --> 02:16:30,905
Found one!
