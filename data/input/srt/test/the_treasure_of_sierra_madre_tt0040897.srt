PAT McCORMICK?

161
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,624
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
MEET US HERE.

162
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:16,834
DOES HE OWE YOU
ANY MONEY?

163
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,168
YEAH.

164
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,586
SAY, HOW LONG
YOU GUYS

165
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,005
BEEN AROUND
TAMPICO, ANYWAY?

166
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,923
WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

167
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,466
ONLY FOREIGNERS AND
HALF-BAKED AMERICANS

168
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,176
FALL FOR
McCORMICK'S TRICKS.

169
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,344
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

170
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,971
I MEAN HE HIRES
DUMB GUYS LIKE YOU

171
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,180
TO WORK FOR HIM.

172
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,724
WHEN IT COMES
TIME TO PAY OFF,

173
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,267
HE TAKES A POWDER.

174
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,688
HOW MUCH WE GOT LEFT

175
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:39,523
OF THAT 10
HE GAVE US, DOBBSY?

176
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,025
$2.50.

177
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,527
NOT EVEN ENOUGH
FOR ONE BED.

178
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,447
I KNOW A JOINT
THAT'S FULL OF RATS,

179
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:49,199
SCORPIONS,
AND COCKROACHES.

180

00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,977

WHY, SURE THERE IS.

186
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,439
NOT 10 DAYS FROM HERE
BY RAIL OR PACK TRAIN,

187
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,066
THERE'S A MOUNTAIN
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT GUY

188
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,734
TO COME ALONG,
DISCOVER A TREASURE,

189
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,402
AND THEN TICKLE IT
TILL IT LETS HIM HAVE IT.

190
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,446
THE QUESTION IS,
ARE YOU THE RIGHT GUY?

191
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,490
AH, REAL BONANZAS
ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.

192
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,532
THEY TAKE A LOT OF FINDING.

193
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,493
SAY, ANSWER ME THIS ONE,
WILL YOU?

194
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:34,495
WHY IS GOLD WORTH
SOME 20 BUCKS AN OUNCE?

195
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,996
I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE IT'S SCARCE.

196
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,956
1,000 MEN, SAY,
GO SEARCHING FOR GOLD.

197
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,500
AFTER 6 MONTHS,
ONE OF THEM'S LUCKY--

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,918
ONE OUT OF THE 1,000.

199
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,045
HIS FIND REPRESENTS
NOT ONLY HIS OWN LABOR

200
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,547
BUT THAT OF
999 OTHERS TO BOOT.

201
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,050
THAT'S 6,000 MONTHS,
OR 500 YEARS,

202
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,053
SCRABBLING OVER MOUNTAINS,
GOING HUNGRY AND THIRSTY.

203
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:52,763
AN OUNCE OF GOLD, MISTER,
IS WORTH WHAT IT IS

204
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:53,931
BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN LABOR

205
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:56,058
THAT WENT INTO THE FINDING
AND THE GETTING OF IT.

206
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,559
NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
JUST LIKE THAT.

207
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,061
THERE'S NO OTHER
EXPLANATION, MISTER.

208
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:00,562
GOLD ITSELF
AIN'T GOOD FOR NOTHING

209
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:02,189
EXCEPT FOR MAKING
JEWELRY WITH, GOLD TEETH.

210
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,400
GOLD'S A DEVILISH
SORT OF A THING, ANYWAY.

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,110
YOU START OUT, YOU TELL
YOURSELF YOU'LL BE SATISFIED

212
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,153
WITH 25,000 HANDSOME
SMACKERS WORTH OF IT.

213
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:09,613
SO HELP MY LORD
AND CROSS MY HEART.

214
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,781
FINE RESOLUTION.

215
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,908
AFTER MONTHS OF
SWEATING YOURSELF DIZZY

216
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,034
AND GROWING SHORT
ON PROVISIONS

217
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,077
AND FINDING NOTHING,

218
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:17,079
YOU FINALLY COME DOWN
TO 15,000, THEN 10.

219
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,581
FINALLY, YOU SAY, "LORD,
LET ME JUST FIND $5,000.

220
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:22,793
I'LL NEVER ASK FOR ANYTHING
MORE THE REST OF MY LIFE."

221
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,087
$5,000 IS
A LOT OF MONEY.

222
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,298
YEAH, HERE IN THIS JOINT
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT,

223
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:29,133
BUT, I TELL YOU, IF YOU WAS
TO MAKE A REAL STRIKE,

224
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,592
YOU COULDN'T BE
DRAGGED AWAY.

225
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,303
NOT EVEN THE THREAT
OF MISERABLE DEATH

226
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,096
WOULD KEEP YOU FROM TRYING
TO ADD 10,000 MORE.

227
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,598
10, YOU'D WANT TO GET 25.
25, YOU'D WANT TO GET 50.

228
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,683
50, 100.

229
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,435
LIKE ROULETTE,
ONE MORE TURN--

230
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,686
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS ONE MORE.

231
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,980
IT WOULDN'T BE
THAT WAY WITH ME.

232
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,982
I SWEAR IT WOULDN'T.

233
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,984
I'D TAKE ONLY
WHAT I SET OUT TO GET,

234
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,319
EVEN IF THERE WAS STILL

235
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,820
A HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS WORTH

236

I'VE DUG IN ALASKA
AND CANADA AND COLORADO.

238
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,826
I WAS WITH THE CROWD
IN THE BRITISH HONDURAS

239
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,161
BEFORE I'D MADE
MY FARE BACK HOME

240
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,370
AND ALMOST ENOUGH OVER

241
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,080
TO CURE ME OF THE FEVER
I'D CAUGHT.

242
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,582
DUG IN CALIFORNIA
AND AUSTRALIA,

243
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,584
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
PRACTICALLY.

244
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,629
I KNOW WHAT GOLD
DOES TO MEN'S SOULS.

245
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,340
YOU TALK AS THOUGH
YOU STRUCK IT RICH

246
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,674
SOMETIME OR OTHER, POP.

247
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,092
HOW ABOUT IT?

248
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,303
THEN WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN HERE,

249
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,096
A DOWN-AND-OUTER?

250
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,098
THAT'S THE GOLD.
THAT'S WHAT IT MAKES OF US.

251
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,850
NEVER KNEW A PROSPECTOR YET
THAT DIED RICH.

252
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,143
MAKE ONE FORTUNE,

253
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:24,104
YOU'RE SURE TO BLOW IT
IN TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER.

254
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,106
I'M NO EXCEPTION
TO THE RULE.

255
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,609
AH, SURE,
I'M AN ODD OLD BONE NOW,

256
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,986
BUT, SAY, DON'T YOU GUYS
THINK THE SPIRIT'S GONE.

257
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:33,113
I'M ALL SET TO SHOULDER
A PICKAX AND A SHOVEL

258
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,115
ANYTIME ANYBODY'S
WILLING TO SHARE EXPENSES.

259
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,742
RATHER GO BY MYSELF.
GOING IT ALONE'S THE BEST WAY,

260
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:39,036
BUT YOU GOT TO HAVE
A STOMACH FOR LONELINESS.

261
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,663
SOME GUYS
GO NUTTY WITH IT.

262
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,164
ON THE OTHER HAND,
GOING WITH A PARTNER, TOO,

263
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:43,874
IS DANGEROUS--MURDER'S
ALWAYS LURKING ABOUT,

264
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:48,003
PARTNERS ACCUSING EACH OTHER
OF ALL SORTS OF CRIMES.

265
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:50,547
OH, AS LONG
AS THERE'S NO FIND,

266
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,549
THE NOBLE BROTHERHOOD
WILL LAST.

267
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:55,552
BUT WHEN THE PILES OF GOLD
BEGIN TO GROW,

268
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,138
THAT'S WHEN
THE TROUBLE STARTS.

269
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,556
ME, NOW, I WOULDN'T MIND

270
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,975
A LITTLE OF
THAT KIND OF TROUBLE.

271
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,978
AH, I THINK
I'LL GO TO SLEEP

272
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:07,022
AND DREAM ABOUT
PILES OF GOLD

273
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:11,694
GETTING BIGGER
AND BIGGER AND BIGGER.

274
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,741
DO YOU BELIEVE
WHAT THAT OLD MAN

275
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,243
WHO WAS DOING
ALL THE TALKING

276
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:21,036
AT THE OSO NEGRO
SAID THE OTHER NIGHT

277
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:23,998
ABOUT GOLD CHANGING
A MAN'S SOUL

278
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,749
SO'S HE AIN'T
THE SAME KIND OF A GUY

279
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,918
THAT HE WAS
BEFORE FINDING IT?

280
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:30,045
GUESS THAT ALL
DEPENDS ON THE MAN.

281
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,589
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I SAY.

282
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,050
GOLD DON'T CARRY
ANY CURSE WITH IT.

283
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,052
IT ALL DEPENDS
ON WHETHER OR NOT

284
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,388
THE GUY WHO FINDS IT
IS THE RIGHT GUY.

285
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,098
THE WAY I SEE IT,

286
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:44,101
GOLD CAN BE AS MUCH OF
A BLESSING AS A CURSE.

287
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,561
HEY, UH, DOBBSY.

288
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:47,062
YEAH?

289
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:50,065
LOOK WHO'S COMING OUT
OF THE HOTEL BRISTOL.

290

IS THAT PAT McCORMICK,
OR AM I SEEING THINGS?

291
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,074

292
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,451
LET'S GET HIM.

293
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,660
LET'S GET HIM HARD.

294

295
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,663
GO AND BUY ME

311
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,309
WELL, FELLAS,

KEEPING YOURSELVES?

313
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,063
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

314
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:34,026
3 SHOTS OF RYE.

315
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,527
MAKE MINE BRANDY.

316
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,029
2 BRANDIES.

317
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,530
RYE'S GOOD
ENOUGH FOR ME.

318
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,033
WELL, BOYS, I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT

319
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,993
THAT MONEY
THAT'S COMING TO YOU.

320
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:43,994
THE FACT IS,
I HAVEN'T BEEN PAID OFF

321
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,329
ON THAT CONTRACT YET
MYSELF.

322
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,497
IF I HAD THE MONEY,

323
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:47,915
YOU'D GET IT FIRST THING.
YOU KNOW THAT.

324
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,958
I'LL PUT YOU BOTH
ON MY NEXT CONTRACT.

325
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,001
IT'LL COME THROUGH
BY MONDAY

326
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,127
AND WE CAN SET OUT FRIDAY.

327
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,463
HERE'S MUD IN YOUR EYE!

328
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,550
WE WANT WHAT'S COMING
TO US,

329
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,302
AND WE WANT IT
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

330
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,637
WELL, DIDN'T I JUST GET
THROUGH TELLING YOU--

331
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:02,846
BETTER COME ACROSS, PAT.

332
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,306
WELL, BOYS, I TELL YOU
WHAT I'LL DO.

333
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,849
I'LL GIVE YOU 25%.

334
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,476
I GUESS I CAN
MAKE IT 30%,

335
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:08,477
AND THE BALANCE,

336
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,687
SAY, THE MIDDLE
OF NEXT WEEK, HUH?

337
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,021
NOTHING DOING.
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

338
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:12,898
EVERY CENT YOU OWE US
OR YOU WON'T WALK OUT OF HERE.

339
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,191
YOU'LL HAVE
TO BE CARRIED OUT.

340
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,693
OH, NOW, LET'S DON'T
STOP BEING FRIENDS.

341
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:16,694
HOW ABOUT
ANOTHER DRINK?

342
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,112
2 MORE BRANDIES
FOR THE GENTLEMEN,

343
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:19,488
AND PUT THE BOTTLE
ON THE BAR.

344
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,657
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEAS ABOUT
GETTING US LIQUORED UP...

345
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,158
OH, NO. I'M JUST
INVITING YOU

346
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,827
TO HAVE A FRIENDLY
DRINK WITH ME.

347
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,470
[PANTING]

348
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:32,853
I'M LICKED, BOYS.
I'M LICKED.

349
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,063
Curtin:
GIVE US OUR MONEY.

350
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,982
YEAH.
GIVE US OUR MONEY.

351
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:43,072
I CAN'T SEE.

352
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:49,995
50...100...

353
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,998
200...300.

354
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:55,000
THAT'S IT,
AIN'T IT, CURT?

355
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,585
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

356
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,005
LET'S BEAT IT BEFORE
THE LAW ARRIVES.

357
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:06,011
HERE'S FOR THE DRINKS
AND THE USE OF THE CANTINA.

358
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,017
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, CURT?

359
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,435
WHAT?

360
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:15,437
WE AIN'T VERY SMART,

361
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,023
HANGING AROUND TAMPICO
WAITING FOR A JOB.

362
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:19,650
THE MONEY'S GETTING
SHORTER EVERY DAY,

363
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,818
AND PRETTY SOON

364
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:22,319
WE'RE RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE WERE--

365
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,821
ON THE BUM AGAIN,

366
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,322
PUSHING GUYS
FOR DIMES

367
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,324
AND SLEEPING AROUND
IN FREIGHT CARS.

368
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:28,826
GOT ANY IDEAS?

369
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:31,537
YEAH. THAT OLD MAN
IN THE OSO NEGRO

370
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,038
STARTED ME TO THINKING.

371
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,540
WHAT ABOUT?

372
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,542
WHY NOT TRY GOLD DIGGING
FOR A CHANGE?

373
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,127
WELL, IT AIN'T
ANY RISKIER

374
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,795
THAN WAITING AROUND HERE
FOR A BREAK.

375
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,005
AND THIS IS THE COUNTRY

376
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,132
WHERE THE NUGGETS OF GOLD
ARE JUST CRYING FOR YOU

377
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:45,050
TO TAKE THEM
OUT OF THE GROUND,

378
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,553
MAKE THEM SHINE
IN COINS,

379
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:51,056
ON THE FINGERS AND NECKS
OF SWELL DAMES.

380
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:52,558
ONE THING,
LIVING IN THE OPEN'S

381
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,184
CHEAPER THAN IT IS
HERE IN TAMPICO.

382
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,686
OUR MONEY
WOULD LAST LONGER.

383
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,479
SURE. THE LONGER IT LASTS,
THE GREATER OUR CHANCE

384
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,398
OF DIGGING SOMETHING
UP WOULD BE.

385
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,317
WE'D HAVE TO HAVE
EQUIPMENT, ALL RIGHT--

386
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,569
PICKS AND SPADES,
PANS, BURROS.

387
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:05,571
WONDER HOW MUCH
IT WOULD ALL COST.

388
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,072
THAT OLD MAN
WOULD KNOW.

389
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:09,074
YEAH. HE COULD GIVE US
SOME POINTERS, ALL RIGHT.

390
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:11,076
HE'S TOO OLD TO TAKE ALONG
WITH US, OF COURSE.

391
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,578
WE'D HAVE TO PACK HIM
ON OUR BACKS.

392
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:14,580
YOU CAN'T TELL ABOUT
SOME OF THOSE OLD GUYS.

393
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,583
IT'S SURPRISING SOMETIMES
HOW TOUGH THEY ARE.

394
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,585
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOLD
LOOKS LIKE IN THE GROUND.

395
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,754
I'VE ONLY SEEN IT
IN JEWELRY STORE WINDOWS

396
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:23,589
AND PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.

397
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,716
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT PROSPECTING?

398
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:28,594
UH, NOT MUCH WHEN YOU
COME RIGHT DOWN TO IT.

399
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:30,095
WE MIGHT HAVE REAL USE

400
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,889
FOR AN EXPERIENCED GUY
LIKE THAT OLD-TIMER.

401
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,099
LET'S GO HUNT HIM UP
RIGHT AWAY.

402
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:38,896
WILL I GO? WHAT A QUESTION.
OF COURSE I'LL GO.

403
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,230
ANY TIME, ANY DAY.

404
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,607
I WAS ONLY WAITING FOR
ONE OR TWO GUYS TO ASK ME.

405
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,609
HUNT FOR GOLD?
ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE.

406
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:46,153
I GOT 300 AMERICAN BUCKS
READY CASH HERE IN THE BANK.

407
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,613
200 I'M ALL SET TO INVEST.

408
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:48,906
IT'S THE LAST MONEY
I GOT IN THE WORLD,

409
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,407
AND THAT'S ON ACCOUNT
OF I'M ALL FINISHED UP.

410
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:51,909
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE A RISK,
CAN'T MAKE A GAIN.

411
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,410
HOW MUCH DOUGH
YOU GUYS GOT TO PUT IN?

412
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,953
I GOT 150 BUCKS,

413
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,622
AND CURTIN HERE
HAS GOT THE SAME.

414
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:57,915
500 BUCKS
AIN'T HARDLY ENOUGH

415
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,084
TO BUY THE TOOLS AND WEAPONS
AND ESSENTIAL PROVISIONS.

416
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,627
WEAPONS? WHAT DO
WE NEED WEAPONS FOR?

417
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,629
MEAT'S ONE THING
AND BANDITS ANOTHER.

418
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,130
BANDIT COUNTRY'S
WHERE WE'D BE GOING.

419
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,132
WE OUGHT TO HAVE
600 BUCKS BETWEEN US.

420
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,634
THAT MUCH, EH?

421
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,636
CAN'T YOU DIG UP
ANY MORE?

422
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,346
NOT A RED CENT.

423
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,639
SEÑOR!

424
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,641
SEÑOR! GIVE ME
MY MONEY, SEÑOR!

425
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,143
10% PERCENT I GET FOR
SELLING THE WINNING TICKET!

426
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,979
GET AWAY FROM ME,
WILL YOU?

427
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,063
AW, PLEASE, SEÑOR.

428
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:22,064
WHOEVER DRAWS
THE LUCKY NUMBER

429
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,148
ALWAYS GIVES A PRESENT
TO THE SELLER--

430
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:25,150
I TELL YOU, I DON'T WANT
ANY LOTTERY TICKET!

431
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,986
IF YOU DON'T,
YOU HAVE BAD LUCK

432
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,278
REST OF YOUR LIFE!

433
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:31,281
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DID YOU FIRST SAY?

434
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:33,117
HE'S TRYING TO TELL YOU HE
SOLD YOU THE WINNING TICKET.

435
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:36,745
HEY--HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE.

436
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:37,997
THIS WHAT YOU MEAN?

437
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,039
<i>SI, SEÑOR.</i>

438
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,541
YOU SAY
IT'S A WINNER?

439
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,544
<i>SI. A 200-PESO PRIZE.
TRES-SIETE-DOS-UNO.</i>

440
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,045
HEY! THAT'S MY NUMBER!

441
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,547
SURE ENOUGH!

442
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,549
OH, JUST LOOK AT THAT FAT,
RICH, PRINTED NUMBER.

443
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,385
THAT'S THE KIND
OF SUGAR PAPA LIKES.

444
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,889
OH, 200 PESOS. WELCOME,
SWEET LITTLE SMACKAROOS.

445
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,475
HERE, SON. HERE'S A PRESENT
FOR YOU, WITH MY BLESSING.

446
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:00,477
<i>MUCHAS GRACIAS,
SEÑOR.</i>

447
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:03,480
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SHAKE THE HAND

448
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,648
THAT BOUGHT THAT TICKET?

449
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:05,649
CONGRATULATIONS.

450
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:06,900
CONGRATULATIONS
YOURSELF.

451
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,111
YOU STAND TO PROFIT
OUT OF THIS THE SAME AS I DO.

452
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,279
HOW DO YOU MAKE
THAT OUT?

453
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,531
WELL, DIDN'T HE JUST SAY
WE NEEDED 600 BUCKS?

454
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,699
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE GOT NOW, AIN'T IT?

455
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,200
YEAH, BUT--
BUT WHAT?

456
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,452
HOW COME YOU'RE
PUTTING UP FOR ME?

457
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,454
THIS IS AN ALL-OR-NOTHING
PROPOSITION, AIN'T IT?

458
00:21:18,454 --> 00:21:19,621
IF WE MAKE A FIND,

459
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,498
WE'LL BE LIGHTING OUR CIGARS
WITH $100 BILLS.

460
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,000
IF WE DON'T,
THE DIFFERENCE

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,668
BETWEEN WHAT YOU PUT UP
AND WHAT I PUT UP

462
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,337
AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP ME
FROM BEING RIGHT BACK

463
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:27,630
WHERE I WAS
THIS AFTERNOON--

464
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,381
POLISHING A BENCH
WITH THE SEAT OF MY PANTS.

465
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,967

BE WORTH YOUR WHILE,

HAS GROWN, SAY,

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,505

759
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:23,007

00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:32,266
BY THE TIME THE PILE HAS GROWN
TO BE REALLY TEMPTING,

765
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,518
I WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN
HALF AS FAST AS EITHER OF YOU.

766
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,979
YOU'D GET ME BY THE COLLAR
AND STRING ME UP IN NO TIME.

767
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,356
THAT'S WHY I THINK I'M THE MOST

LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

A GOOD IDEA

THE BIGGEST RETURN, DON'T HE?

919

IN FAVOR OF THE WILDS.

00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:06,363
SO?

936
00:44:06,363 --> 00:44:07,531
SORRY, DOBBSY.

937
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:08,532
<i>I THINK I'LL SEE</i>

938
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:09,700
IF THE BURROS
ARE ALL RIGHT.

939
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,993
GO AHEAD.
HELP YOURSELF.

940
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:27,509
WHAT'S UP?

941
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:29,011
NOTHING'S UP.

942
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:32,681
WHERE'S DOBBS?

943
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:35,684
POKING AROUND IN
THE DARK OUT THERE.

944
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:41,982
HE'S SURE TAKING
A LONG TIME OUT THERE.

945
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,526
I THINK I'LL GO
HAVE A LOOK-SEE.

946
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:08,050
WHERE'S CURTIN?

947
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,593
HE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.

948
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:12,972
SAID HE WAS GOING
TO HAVE A LOOK-SEE.

949
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:42,084
IT'S COME AROUND
TO ME AGAIN,

950
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:43,294
BUT I WON'T TAKE
MY TURN

951
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:44,461
IF YOU GUYS WILL
STOP WORRYING

952
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:45,796
ABOUT YOUR GOODS
AND GO TO BED.

953
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:47,339
WE GOT WORK
TO DO TOMORROW.

954
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:02,146
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME SLEEPING.

955
00:46:02,146 --> 00:46:04,898
DON'T YOU EVER
BELIEVE THAT.

956
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:06,400
I'M NOT THAT DUMB.

957
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,653
THE DAY YOU TRY TO PUT
ANYTHING OVER ON ME

958
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:12,573
WILL BE A COSTLY ONE
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

959
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:24,209
ANY MORE LIP OUT OF YOU,

960
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:27,212
AND I'LL HAUL OFF
AND LET YOU HAVE IT.

961
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:28,797
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,

962
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:32,885
YOU WON'T MONKEY AROUND
WITH FRED C. DOBBS.

963
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:36,680
OUGHT TO GET
A LOAD OF DOBBS.

964
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,015
HE'S DOWN THERE
TALKING TO HIMSELF

965
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,183
A MILE A MINUTE.

966
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:40,517
YEAH, SOMETHING'S
EATING HIM, ALL RIGHT.

967
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:41,602
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

968
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,312
HE'S JUST SPOILING
FOR TROUBLE.

969
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:52,988
"WE'RE RUNNING SHORT
OF PROVISIONS, DOBBSY.

970
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:55,532
HOW ABOUT YOU GOING
TO THE VILLAGE?"

971
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:58,035
WHO DOES HOWARD THINK HE IS,
ORDERING ME AROUND?

972
00:46:58,035 --> 00:46:59,536
WHAT'S THAT, DOBBS?

973
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:00,537
NOTHING.

974
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:02,039
BETTER LOOK OUT.
IT'S A BAD SIGN

975
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,540
WHEN A GUY STARTS
TALKING TO HIMSELF.

976
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,459
HELL, WHO ELSE
AM I GOING TO TALK TO?

977
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:07,044
CERTAINLY NOT YOU
OR CURTIN.

978
00:47:07,044 --> 00:47:08,712
FINE PARTNERS
YOU TWO ARE.

979
00:47:08,712 --> 00:47:09,797
GOT SOMETHING
UP YOUR NOSE?

980
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:11,173
BLOW IT OUT.
IT'LL DO YOU GOOD.

981
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:12,508
DON'T GET THE IDEA

982
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:13,759
YOU TWO ARE PUTTING
ANYTHING OVER ON ME.

983
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:14,760
TAKE IT EASY,
DOBBS.

984
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,261
I KNOW WHAT
YOUR GAME IS.

985
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:17,388
WELL, YOU KNOW MORE
THAN I DO.

986
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:18,764
WHY AM I ELECTED
TO GO TO THE VILLAGE?

987
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:20,307
WHY ME INSTEAD
OF YOU AND CURTIN?

988
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,518
DON'T THINK I DON'T
SEE THROUGH THAT.

989
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:24,353
YOU TWO HAVE THROWN
TOGETHER AGAINST ME.

990
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:26,188
THE 2 DAYS I'D BE GONE
WOULD GIVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME

991
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:27,982
TO DISCOVER WHERE
MY GOODS ARE, WOULDN'T IT?

992
00:47:27,982 --> 00:47:29,608
IF YOU FEEL
ALONG THOSE LINES,

993
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:31,068
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR
GOODS ALONG WITH YOU?

994
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:32,403
AND RUN THE RISK

995
00:47:32,403 --> 00:47:34,488
OF HAVING THEM TAKEN
FROM ME BY BANDITS?

996
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:35,739
IF YOU WAS TO RUN INTO
BANDITS,

997
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:36,907
YOU'D BE
OUT OF LUCK ANYWAY.

998
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,450
THEY'D KILL YOU FOR
THE SHOES ON YOUR FEET.

999
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,077
OH, SO THAT'S IT.

1000
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:41,745
EVERYTHING'S CLEAR NOW.

1001
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,872
YOU'RE HOPING BANDITS
WILL GET ME.

1002
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:47,376
THAT WOULD SAVE YOU
A LOT OF TROUBLE, WOULDN'T IT?

1003
00:47:47,376 --> 00:47:49,837
AND YOUR CONSCIENCES WOULDN'T
BOTHER YOU NONE, NEITHER.

1004
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:52,965
ALL RIGHT, DOBBS.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

1005
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:23,621
AH, JUST LIKE
I THOUGHT.

1006
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:24,913
WHAT'S THE IDEA?

1007
00:48:24,913 --> 00:48:26,415
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

1008
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,752
I THINK I'M GOING
TO HAUL OFF

1009
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:31,462
AND PUMP YOU UP,
CHEST AND BELLY ALIKE.

1010
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:32,588
GO AHEAD, BUT WOULD YOU
MIND TELLING ME

1011
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:33,964
WHAT THIS IS ALL
ABOUT FIRST?

1012
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:35,424
YOU WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERES
PLAYING DUMB!

1013
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:37,134
WELL, I'LL BE.

1014
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:38,886
SO THAT'S WHERE YOUR GOODS
ARE HIDDEN, EH, DOBBSY?

1015
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:40,971
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE HERE?

1016
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:42,139
SEEMS LIKE I ACCIDENTALLY

1017
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:43,307
STUMBLED ON
DOBBSY'S TREASURE.

1018
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:44,308
ACCIDENTALLY?

1019
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:45,768
WHY WERE YOU TRYING
TO PRY UP THAT ROCK?

1020
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:46,769
TELL ME THAT.

1021
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:48,270
BECAUSE I SAW
A GILA MONSTER

1022
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,313
CRAWL UNDER IT.

1023
00:48:49,313 --> 00:48:50,773
OH, BROTHER.
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU.

1024
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:52,775
YOU CAN CERTAINLY
THINK UP A GOOD STORY

1025
00:48:52,775 --> 00:48:54,276
WHEN YOU NEED ONE.

1026
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:55,778
OK, I'M A LIAR.

1027
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:57,780
THERE ISN'T A GILA
MONSTER UNDER THERE.

1028
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,323
LET'S SEE YOU STICK
YOUR HAND IN

1029
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:00,532
AND GET YOUR GOODS OUT.

1030
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:01,784
GO AHEAD.

1031
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:03,118
SURE, I WILL.

1032
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:04,787
DON'T YOU TRY
ANY BAD MOVES.

1033
00:49:04,787 --> 00:49:06,789
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL STAY RIGHT WHERE I AM.

1034
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:07,998
I WANT TO SEE THIS.

1035
00:49:07,998 --> 00:49:09,500
REACH IN AND GET
YOUR GOODS.

1036
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,168
IF YOU DON'T,
WE'LL THINK YOU'RE YELLOW,

1037
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:13,295
WON'T WE, HOWARD?

1038

THEY NEVER LET GO,
DO THEY, HOWARD,

1039
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:16,632
ONCE THEY GRAB
ON TO YOU?

1040
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:18,801
YOU CAN CUT THEM
IN TWO,

1041
00:49:18,801 --> 00:49:20,844
AND THE HEAD WILL STILL
HANG ON

1042
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:22,221
TILL SUNDOWN, I HEAR.

1043
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,223
BY THAT TIME, THE VICTIM
DOESN'T USUALLY CARE,

1044
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,474
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD
ANYWAY.

1045
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:26,976
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
HOWARD?

1046
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:28,227
I RECKON.

1047
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,645
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DOBBSY?
WHY DON'T YOU

1048
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:31,146
STICK YOUR HAND RIGHT IN
AND GET YOUR TREASURE?

1049
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:33,148
COULDN'T BE BECAUSE
YOU'RE SCARED TO, COULD IT,

SHOOTING YOUR MOUTH OFF?

1051
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:36,318

YELLOW, DOBBSY.

1055
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:44,243
OK, HOWARD.

1056
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:45,286
I GOT HIM COVERED.

1057
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:46,704
DOBBS, ANOTHER BAD MOVE
OUT OF YOU

1058
00:49:46,704 --> 00:49:49,081

00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:05,175
THE CEMETERY.

1090
00:52:05,175 --> 00:52:07,011
OH.

00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:08,512
<i>BUENOS DIAS, AMIGO.</i>

1092

<i>BUENOS DIAS,

1093

DON'T OPERATE
IN OUR AMERICAN WAY.

1097
00:52:20,024 --> 00:52:21,525
THEY AREN'T FINGERPRINT
EXPERTS, THAT IS.

1098
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:23,277
THEY CAN FOLLOW ANY TRAIL.

1099
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:24,778
AGAINST THEM,
NO HIDEOUT'S ANY USE.

1100
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:27,781
THEY KNOW ALL THE TRICKS
OF THE BANDITS.

1101

YEP, YOU CAN BET
YOUR SWEET SOUL

1102
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:30,868
THEY'LL TRACE DOWN

1103

EVERY LAST ONE
OF THAT GROUP

1104

THAT ATTACKED
THE TRAIN.

1105
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:35,789
IT'LL TAKE TIME--
MONTHS MAYBE--

1106
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,291
BUT THEY'LL DO IT.

YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE

MY NAME'S CODY.

1115
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,224
I'M FROM TEXAS.

00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:57,061
WHAT'S YOUR GAME?

1118
00:52:57,061 --> 00:52:58,228
I'M A HUNTER.

00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:00,814

DO YOU HUNT?

1122
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:03,567
OH, TIGER CATS...

1123
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,361
ANYTHING
OF COMMERCIAL VALUE.

1124
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:06,737
HOW LONG DID YOU SAY

1125
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:08,280
YOU'VE BEEN
IN THESE MOUNTAINS?

1126
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,782
OH, A FEW MONTHS.

1127
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:12,242
EVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT
LOOKED LIKE PAYDIRT?

1128
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:13,577
NAH.

1129
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:15,412
I'VE A HUNCH THERE'S
LOADS OF THE REAL GOODS

1130
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:17,414
UP IN THOSE MOUNTAINS.

1131
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:19,583
NO, I KNOW THE WHOLE
LANDSCAPE AROUND HERE.

1132
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,085
IF THERE HAD BEEN
A SINGLE GRAIN OF GOLD,

1133
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:22,503
YOU CAN BET
I'D HAVE SURE SEEN IT.

1134
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:24,421
THERE'S NOTHING
DOING HERE FOR GOLD.

1135
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:26,423
LISTEN, BROTHER, I CAN LOOK
AT A HILL 5 MILES AWAY

1136
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:29,259
AND TELL YOU WHETHER IT CARRIES
AN OUNCE OR A SHIPLOAD.

1137
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:30,594
<i>¿CUANTO?</i>

1138
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,221
IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING UP THERE YET,

1139
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:34,056
I'LL COME ALONG WITH YOU
AND PUT YOUR NOSE IN IT.

1140
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:35,599
THERE'S INDICATIONS
IN THIS VALLEY,

1141
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,600
LOTS OF INDICATIONS.

1142
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,768
BY TRACING THE ROCKS,

1143
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:39,269
I FIND THEY COME
FROM THAT RIDGE UP THERE,

1144
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:40,437
WASHED DOWN BY
THE TROPICAL RAIN.

1145
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:41,480
YOU DON'T SAY SO?

1146
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,898
YES, I SAY SO.

[GUNSHOTS]

1148
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,944
SO MUCH FOR
THOSE BANDITS.

1149
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:49,446
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO
HAND IT TO THE MEXICANS

1150
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:50,948
WHEN IT COMES
TO SWIFT JUSTICE.

1151
00:53:50,948 --> 00:53:52,116
<i>ONCE THE FEDERALES</i>

1152
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:53,450
GET THEIR MITTS
ON A CRIMINAL,

1153
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:54,952
THEY KNOW JUST WHAT
TO DO WITH HIM.

1154
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:56,912
THEY HAND HIM A SHOVEL,
TELL HIM WHERE TO DIG.

1155
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:58,038
WHEN HE'S DUG DEEP ENOUGH,

1156
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,456
THEY TELL HIM TO PUT
THE SHOVEL DOWN,

1157
00:53:59,456 --> 00:54:01,959
SMOKE A CIGARETTE,
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS.

1158
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:03,127
IN ANOTHER 5 MINUTES,

1159
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:05,921
HE'S BEING COVERED OVER
WITH THE EARTH HE DUG OUT.

1160
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:08,132
YEAH, YOU GOTTA HAND IT
TO 'EM, ALL RIGHT.

1161
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:21,145
I MEANT WHAT I SAID

1162
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:22,521
ABOUT GOING ALONG
WITH YOU.

1163
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:23,981
THOSE ARE
MY TWO BURROS.

1164
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:25,482
I'M ALL PACKED UP
AND READY TO START

1165
00:54:25,482 --> 00:54:26,817
IF YOU'LL LET ME
GO WITH YOU

1166
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:27,985
BACK TO YOUR CAMP.

1167
00:54:27,985 --> 00:54:31,196
THANKS ANYWAY, BUT I PREFER
GOING IT BY MYSELF.

1168
00:54:31,196 --> 00:54:32,615
GOOD LUCK.
ADIOS.

1169
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:34,116
BURROS!

1170
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:46,128
I WENT A WAY AROUND
AND STAYED ON HARD GROUND

1171
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:47,755
WHICH WOULDN'T SHOW
THE TRACKS.

1172
00:54:47,755 --> 00:54:49,340
EVERY TIME I HIT A HIGH POINT
AND LOOKED BACK,

1173
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,508
I COULD SEE HE WAS
STILL COMING RIGHT ALONG.

1174
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:53,344
I GUESS IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

1175
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:54,595
UNTIL HE SHOWS UP HERE.

1176
00:54:54,637 --> 00:54:56,513
I MOVE WE TELL HIM
STRAIGHT OFF TO BEAT IT.

1177
00:54:56,513 --> 00:54:58,015
AH, NO, THAT WOULD
BE FOOLISH.

1178
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:59,350
HE'D SIT AROUND
FOR AN HOUR OR SO

1179
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,517
PLAYING THE INNOCENT,

1180
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:01,852
THEN GO AND REPORT US
TO THE OFFICIALS.

1181
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:02,853
ONCE THEY WERE HERE,

1182
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:03,854
WE COULDN'T STAY
ANY LONGER,

1183
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:05,189
AND WE COULDN'T TAKE
OUR GOODS WITH US

1184
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:06,357
WHEN WE LEFT.

1185
00:55:06,357 --> 00:55:07,691
ALL RIGHT, THEN THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE TO DO

1186
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:08,859
BUT PULL THE TRIGGER
THE MINUTE HE APPEARS.

1187
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:10,361
IT'S NO CRIME TO VISIT
THESE MOUNTAINS.

1188
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:11,362
HE MIGHT BE A GUY

1189
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:12,363
THAT JUST LIKES
TO WANDER AROUND.

1190
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:13,364
CAN'T SHOOT HIM
FOR THAT.

1191
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:14,531
BESIDES, IF YOU WERE
TO SHOOT HIM,

1192
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:15,699
IT MIGHT COME OUT.

1193
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:17,201
WE DON'T HAVE TO
SHOOT HIM, NECESSARILY.

1194
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:18,702
WE CAN PUSH HIM OFF
ONE OF THEM ROCKS

1195
00:55:18,702 --> 00:55:20,037
AND CLAIM IT
AS AN ACCIDENT.

1196
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:21,538
JUST WHO'S GOING
TO DO THE PUSHING--

1197
00:55:21,538 --> 00:55:23,165
YOU, DOBBSY?

1198
00:55:23,165 --> 00:55:24,667
WE'D TOSS FOR IT.

1199
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,669
YOU'RE SURE HE WAS
TRAILING YOU, ARE YOU?

1200
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:28,045
ABSOLUTELY.

1201
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:29,046
HOW COME?

1202
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:30,297
'CAUSE THERE HE IS.

1203
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:49,566
COME OVER BY THE FIRE.

1204
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:00,577
I KNOW QUITE WELL,
YOU FELLAS,

1205
00:56:00,577 --> 00:56:01,745
I'M NOT WANTED HERE.

1206
00:56:01,745 --> 00:56:03,163
BUT EVEN AFTER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME,

1207
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:04,707
I SIMPLY COULDN'T RESIST
THE DESIRE

1208
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:06,709
TO SIT AROUND AND JAW
WITH AN AMERICAN.

1209
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:08,210
WHY DON'T YOU GO
WHERE THERE'S AMERICANS

1210
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,212
MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO YOU?
DURANGO ISN'T TOO FAR OFF.

1211
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:12,923
THEY GOT ONE OF THEM
AMERICAN CLUBS THERE.

1212
00:56:12,923 --> 00:56:14,425
I'M NOT AFTER THAT.

1213
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:17,678
I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS
ON MY MIND MORE IMPORTANT.

1214
00:56:19,054 --> 00:56:20,097
SO HAVE WE.

1215
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:21,432
DON'T YOU MAKE
ANY MISTAKES.

1216
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,100
OUR BIGGEST WORRY RIGHT NOW
IS YOUR PRESENCE HERE.

1217
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,351
WE GOT NO USE FOR YOU.

1218
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:27,104
WE DON'T EVEN WANT YOU
FOR A COOK OR A DISHWASHER.

1219
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:29,481
WE'RE FULL UP.
NO VACANCIES, UNDERSTAND?

1220
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:31,066
AND IN CASE I DON'T
MAKE MYSELF CLEAR,

1221
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,068
I THINK YOU'D BE
DOING YOURSELF A FAVOR

1222
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:34,570
BY PACKING UP

1223
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,572
AND GETTING OUT OF HERE
TOMORROW MORNING.

1224
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:38,866
GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
TAKE OUR BLESSINGS WITH YOU.

1225
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:40,868
THANKS.

1226
00:56:40,909 --> 00:56:42,870
YEAH. GO AHEAD.
HELP YOURSELF.

1227
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:46,332
WE DON'T MIND. WE DON'T
LET GUYS STARVE TO DEATH.

1228
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:48,375
TONIGHT YOU'RE OUR GUEST.

1229
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,462
BUT TOMORROW MORNING,

1230
00:56:51,462 --> 00:56:52,463
LOOK OUT!

1231
00:56:52,463 --> 00:56:54,131
NO TRESPASSING
AROUND HERE.

1232
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:56,884
YOU KNOW, BEWARE
OF THE DOGS, GET IT?

1233
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,098
GOT MYSELF 5 FOXES
AND A LION

1234
00:57:03,098 --> 00:57:05,225
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY
AT THE VILLAGE.

1235
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:06,602
HOW ARE
THE HIDES?

1236
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:07,603
PRETTY GOOD.

1237
00:57:07,603 --> 00:57:08,896
WHERE'D YOU
HIT THEM?

1238
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:10,356
RIGHT THROUGH THEIR EYES.

1239
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:11,482
EXCUSE ME
FOR BUTTING IN,

1240
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:12,816
BUT THERE'S
NO GAME AROUND HERE

1241
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:13,984
WORTH GOING AFTER.

1242
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:15,486
IT WOULDN'T TAKE ONE WEEK
FOR A REAL HUNTER

1243
00:57:15,486 --> 00:57:16,820
TO CLEAN UP ALL AROUND

1244
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,405
FOR 5 MILES
IN EACH DIRECTION.

1245
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:22,159
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S NO GOOD HUNTING HERE.

1246
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,327
THAT'S WHY
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND

1247
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:24,495
TO QUIT THIS GROUND
INSIDE A WEEK

1248
00:57:24,495 --> 00:57:25,829
AND LOOK FOR
SOMETHING BETTER.

1249
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:27,331
YEAH, STRANGER,
YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT.

1250
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:28,540
IT'S AWFUL POOR GROUND.

1251
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,292
TOOK US SOME TIME
TO FIND IT OUT.

1252
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,002
POOR GROUND, YOU SAY?

1253
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:34,463
DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

1254
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,090
FOR GAME, YES.

1255
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,926
MIGHTY GOOD GROUND
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

1256
00:57:38,968 --> 00:57:41,053
YEAH?
WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

1257
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:42,429
GOLD.

1258
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:45,933
GOLD?

1259
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:47,518
HA HA HA HA!

1260
00:57:47,518 --> 00:57:50,187
HA HA HA HA HA!

1261
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:51,522
I TOLD YOU
IN THE VILLAGE, MISTER,

1262
00:57:51,522 --> 00:57:52,773
THERE'S NO GOLD AROUND HERE.

1263
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:54,316
BOY, IF THERE HAD BEEN
ONE SINGLE OUNCE OF IT,

1264
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:55,943
I'D HAVE SEEN IT,
BELIEVE ME, I WOULD.

1265
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:57,569
IF YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND ANY GOLD HERE,

1266
00:57:57,569 --> 00:57:59,405
THEN YOU'RE NOT AS SMART
AS YOU APPEAR TO BE.

1267
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:01,198
WELL, MAYBE.

1268
00:58:01,198 --> 00:58:03,701
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
WHO KNOWS?

1269
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:06,704
YEAH. WE NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT GOLD.

1270
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:08,205
GIVES ME AN IDEA.

1271
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:09,707
GUESS I'LL SLEEP ON IT.

1272
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:12,418
WELL, I'LL HIT THE HAY.

1273
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:14,420
YEAH. ME, TOO.

1274
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,422
TILL IN THE MORNING,
MISTER.

1275
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:33,689
I CAN'T FIGURE
THIS BIRD OUT.

1276
00:58:33,689 --> 00:58:35,232
IS HE WISE TO US
OR ISN'T HE?

1277
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:36,400
WELL, WHETHER
HE IS OR NOT,

1278
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,235
HE LOOKS FAIRLY
HARMLESS TO ME.

1279
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:40,362
WELL, LOOKS CAN BE
MIGHTY DECEIVING.

1280
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:41,864
NO DENYING THAT.

1281
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:45,743
I'M KEEPING MY BOOTS ON
THIS NIGHT.

1282
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:47,244
HE MIGHT TAKE IT
IN HIS HEAD

1283
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:48,829
TO MURDER US
ALL IN OUR SLEEP.

1284
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,331
YEAH.
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

1285
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:51,332
WELL, THEN?

1286
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:52,333
ALL RIGHT,
TELL YOU WHAT.

1287
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,375
YOU TWO GUYS
GO TO SLEEP,

1288
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,377
AND I'LL BE WATCHDOG
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

1289
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:56,879
THEN YOU AND CURTIN
CAN TAKE YOUR TURNS.

1290
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:58,380
OK. YOU GOT
YOUR GUN HANDY?

1291
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,882
YEAH. RIGHT HERE.

1292
00:59:22,446 --> 00:59:24,281
[BURROS BRAYING]

1293
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,913
GOOD MORNING, FRIEND.

1294
00:59:33,457 --> 00:59:35,417
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT WATER
TO MAKE COFFEE?

1295
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,794
I JUST TOOK IT
OUT OF THERE.

1296
00:59:36,794 --> 00:59:37,962
OH, YOU DID,
DID YOU?

1297
00:59:37,962 --> 00:59:39,296
WE DIDN'T CARRY
THAT WATER UP HERE

1298
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:40,631
FOR YOU TO
MAKE COFFEE, SEE?

1299
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:42,132
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
WATER WAS SO HARD TO GET.

1300
00:59:42,132 --> 00:59:43,300
WELL, YOU KNOW IT NOW!

1301
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,635
I'LL FILL IT UP
FOR YOU.

1302
00:59:44,635 --> 00:59:45,928
WHAT'S UP?

1303
00:59:45,928 --> 00:59:48,430
I CAUGHT THIS GUY
STEALING OUR WATER.

1304
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,015
NEXT TIME
YOU TRY THAT,

1305
00:59:50,015 --> 00:59:51,100
I'LL LET IT
OUT OF YOU

1306
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,393
THROUGH LITTLE
ROUND HOLES.

1307
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:54,144
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
I WAS AMONG CIVILIZED MEN

1308
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:55,688
WHO WOULDN'T BEGRUDGE ME
A LITTLE FRESH WATER.

1309
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:56,939
WHO'S NOT CIVILIZED?

1310
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:06,365
I COULD EASILY DO
THE SAME FOR YOU.

1311
01:00:06,365 --> 01:00:09,368
IT'S NOT SETTLED YET
WHO'D COME OUT ON TOP.

1312
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:10,869
THIS TIME, I TOOK IT.

1313
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:12,871
THANKS FOR
YOUR KIND ATTENTION.

1314
01:00:12,871 --> 01:00:14,748
IF I WERE YOU, STRANGER,
I'D PACK UP AND GO

1315
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,875
WHILE THE GOING'S GOOD.

1316
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,168
I MEAN TO STAY
RIGHT HERE.

1317
01:00:18,168 --> 01:00:20,379
THE BRUSH AND THE MOUNTAINS
ARE FREE, AREN'T THEY?

1318
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:21,505
SURE. THAT'S RIGHT,

1319
01:00:21,505 --> 01:00:22,673
TO WHOEVER'S
FIRST ON THE SPOT.

1320
01:00:22,673 --> 01:00:24,383
THAT HOLDS FOR HUNTERS,
BUT NOT FOR GOLD MINERS,

1321
01:00:24,383 --> 01:00:25,509
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

1322
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:27,428
THEY HAPPENED TO HAVE
REGISTERED THEIR CLAIM.

1323
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:28,595
WHO SAYS WE HAVE
A CLAIM TO REGISTER?

1324
01:00:28,637 --> 01:00:30,222
WHATEVER YOU SAY
OR DON'T SAY,

1325
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:32,224
TOMORROW, I START
TO DIG FOR GOLD HERE.

1326
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:43,110
I KNOW VERY WELL

1327
01:00:43,152 --> 01:00:44,737
YOU GUYS CAN BUMP ME OFF
ANY MINUTE YOU WISH,

1328
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:46,113
BUT THAT'S A RISK
WORTH RUNNING

1329
01:00:46,155 --> 01:00:47,448
CONSIDERING THE STAKES.

1330
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:49,116
LET'S LAY ALL OUR CARDS
ON THE TABLE.

1331
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,952
AS I SEE IT, YOU GUYS HAVE
GOT TO DO ONE OF 3 THINGS--

1332
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:53,454
KILL ME, RUN ME OFF,

1333
01:00:53,495 --> 01:00:55,456
OR TAKE ME IN WITH YOU
AS A PARTNER.

1334
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:56,790
LET'S CONSIDER THE FIRST.

1335
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,459
ANOTHER GUY
MAY COME ALONG TOMORROW,

1336
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,294
MAYBE A DOZEN OTHER GUYS.

1337
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:01,629
YOU START
BUMPING PEOPLE OFF,

1338
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,297
JUST HOW FAR ARE YOU
PREPARED TO GO WITH IT?

1339
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:04,298
ASK YOURSELVES THAT.

1340
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,466
ALSO, DON'T FORGET,

1341
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:06,967
THE ONE ACTUALLY TO DO
THE BUMPING OFF

1342
01:01:07,009 --> 01:01:10,304
WOULD FOREVER BE
IN THE POWER OF THE OTHER TWO.

1343
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,972
THE ONLY SAFE WAY
WOULD BE FOR ALL 3 OF YOU

1344
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:13,140
TO DRAG OUT YOUR CANNONS

1345
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:14,475
AND BANG AWAY
AT THE SAME INSTANT

1346
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:15,809
LIKE A FIRING SQUAD.

1347
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:18,729
WE WOULDN'T STOP AT ANYTHING
TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.

1348
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:21,273
I CLAIM
KILLING ME ISN'T IT.

1349
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:23,817
BUT OF COURSE,
THAT'S FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

1350
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:25,319
AS FOR CHOICE NUMBER 2,

1351
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:28,489
IF YOU RUN ME OFF,
I MIGHT VERY WELL INFORM ON YOU.

1352
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,157
WE'D GET YOU
IF YOU DID THAT.

1353
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:31,325
WE'D GET YOU

1354
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:32,868
IF WE HAD TO GO
ALL THE WAY TO CHINA.

1355
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:34,495
25% OF THE VALUE
OF YOUR FIND

1356
01:01:34,536 --> 01:01:35,996
IS THE REWARD
I'D GET PAID,

1357
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:37,498
AND THAT'D BE
MIGHTY TEMPTING.

1358
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:38,666
MIGHTY TEMPTING.

1359
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:40,000
THAT'S A PRETTY
STRONG ARGUMENT

1360
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,168
IN FAVOR OF OUR DOING
NUMBER ONE, MISTER.

1361
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,628
I DON'T DENY IT,

1362
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:45,005
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT
NUMBER 3 HAS TO OFFER.

1363
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:46,840
IF YOU TAKE ME IN
WITH YOU AS A PARTNER,

1364
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,175
YOU DON'T STAND
TO LOSE ANYTHING.

1365
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:50,094
I'LL NOT ASK TO SHARE
IN WHAT YOU'VE MADE SO FAR,

1366
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:51,845
ONLY IN THE PROFITS
TO COME.

1367
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,057
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1368
01:01:56,517 --> 01:01:57,893
DO YOU MIND, STRANGER,

1369
01:01:57,893 --> 01:02:00,354
LETTING US TALK THIS OVER
ALONE AMONG OURSELVES?

1370
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:01,605
NOT AT ALL.
GO AHEAD.

1371
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:04,066
I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER
MY BURROS, ANYWAY.

1372
01:02:18,414 --> 01:02:19,915
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1373
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:21,375
SENDING HIM AWAY
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

1374
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,210
EITHER WE BUMP HIM OFF
OR MAKE HIM A PARTNER.

1375
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:24,920
FRED C. DOBBS
AIN'T A GUY

1376
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,922
LIKES BEING TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF.

1377
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:28,549
DO THE MUG IN,
I SAY.

1378
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,050
TOLD US HOW,
DIDN'T HE?

1379
01:02:30,092 --> 01:02:31,552
ALL 3 OF US
HAUL OUT OUR CANNONS

1380
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:32,720
AND LET HIM HAVE IT.

1381
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:34,221
WHAT DO WE GAIN
BY BUMPING HIM OFF?

1382
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:35,889
IF HE WAS ASKING TO SHARE
IN WHAT WE MADE,

1383
01:02:35,931 --> 01:02:37,057
IT'D BE DIFFERENT.

1384
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:38,559
I DON'T MIND BEING TAKEN
SOME ADVANTAGE OF,

1385
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,893
SO LONG AS IT ISN'T MONEY
OUT OF MY POCKET.

1386
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:41,395
AND WHOEVER ELSE
HAPPENS ALONG--

1387
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:42,896
THEY'RE TO BE
INVITED IN, TOO?

1388
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:44,440
COME ONE,
COME ALL, EH?

1389
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,442
YOU GOT A POINT
THERE, DOBBSY,

1390
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,277
NO QUESTION
ABOUT THAT.

1391
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:49,612
BUT, UH, KILLING...

1392
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,905
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AIN'T YOU UP TO IT?

1393
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,949
SURE, I'M UP TO IT.

1394
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:57,453
LET THE MAJORITY DECIDE.

1395
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:00,456
WHAT'S YOUR VOTE,
PARTNER?

1396
01:03:00,456 --> 01:03:02,124
FOR OR AGAINST?

WELL, I'M ALL FIXED,
