1
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,514
The year is 1893.

2
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,944
Champaner...

3
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,144
A small village in the heart
of India.

4
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,322
The people of Champaner
depended on agriculture...

5
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,624
...like those in thousands
of other villages.

6
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:58,896
A British Cantonment bordered
the village.

7
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,968
Two miles south,
beyond the Cantonment...

8
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,013
...was the fort of the Raja
of this province.

9
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,719
The British protected
the Raja's domain from attacks...

10
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,184
...by neighbouring rulers.

11
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:19,224
They also promised the other Rajas
protection from this Raja!

12
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:23,857
Thanks to this double-dealing,
the British collected a tax...

13
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:28,832
...from the Rajas - which was paid
by every farmer in the country.

14
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,906
Lagaan...

15
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:38,708
The submission of a portion of
the farmer's harvest...

16
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,711
...to the Raja as tax.

17
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:47,544
Every Raja collected Lagaan
from villages under his rule.

18
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:55,418
The Raja would keep one share
and give the rest to the British.

19
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:01,023
In this way,
the British fist grew iron strong.

20
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,501
Like thousands of villagers
across the country...

21
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:08,870
...the farmers toiled
day and night on empty bellies...

22
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:12,168
...and paid taxes to the Raja
year after year.

23
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:20,613
Last year it rained...
but very little.

24
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:25,522
And this year,
there has been no rain so far.

25
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:32,726
Parched eyes scan the sky.

26
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,922
You're standing there again, Mai.
What are you gazing at?

27
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,561
When will the sky darken
with clouds!

28
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,655
How I long to see it...

29
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,426
A month of the rainy season is gone by.
Not a drop of rain yet!

30
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,133
I'm coming...

31
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:17,605
By God's grace, we have
drinking water at least.

32
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,739
Or we'd be parched to the bone.

33
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,140
Such are His ways...!

34
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,511
That's true, Mai.

35
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:28,451
But the fields are thirsty.
How'll the grain ripen!

36
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,487
Don't lose heart, Hari Bhai.

37
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:35,427
If the sky doesn't give water,
we'll dig deep into the ground.

38
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:39,999
We'll tear up the earth and get water.
It's what I told Bhuvan.

39
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,529
Where is he?

40
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,427
He went out in the morning.

41
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,700
It's time to eat.
Send him home if you see him.

42
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:49,808
Yes, Mai.

43
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,277
Stop! You little pests! Stop!
I'll wring your necks!!

44
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,517
Oh, no!
The Great Chicken War again!

45
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:04,216
Goli, you freak! See if I don't
ram you down a gun barrel!

46
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:09,790
Go to hell, Bhura!

47
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,026
Come here, I'll show you!

48
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,892
You just wait, I'm coming!

49
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,171
I'll thrash you so bad
you won't get up from bed for days!

50
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,330
How dare you hit my kids?

51
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:23,534
I'll hang them upside down
and burn chillies under them!

52
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,474
Hassle my hens, will they!

53
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:29,639
And you bleat once more
and I'll burn your slingshot!

54
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,010
Is that so, ha!

55
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:35,747
Oh, stop this daily ruckus!
You fight worse than cats and dogs.

56
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:38,084
But his boys tease my hens!

57
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,592
So? Are they hens or girls!
He acts like they've been molested!

58
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,889
Your hens aren't going to get
married, you know.

59
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,660
Look, Bhura, they are just kids.
And, Goli, control your boys.

60
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,668
Okay... Now tell me,
have you seen Bhuvan?

61
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:52,271
No. You seen him, Bhura?

62
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,270
No.

63
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,003
Why?

64
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,580
Left, right, left.

65
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:05,642
Left, right, left.

66
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,813
Scumbags!
Sons of unmarried jackals!

67
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,983
Strutting around
in the blazing heat!

68
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,844
One day you're going back
to your frozen little island...

69
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,181
...whimpering!

70
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:45,848
I see Saturn glaring balefully at you.

71
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:49,518
Hey, Guran. Why bother
reading their lousy fortune?

72
00:09:49,697 --> 00:09:53,133
They won't even care.
Read my fortune, won't you?

73
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,500
Come on, tell me.
Will I get the Prince of my dreams?

74
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,174
Why not?

75
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,248
If you truly love him,
he'll give you your wedding bangle.

76
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,749
You'll be his bride.

77
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,818
Really? You heard, Jigni.
- Yes!

78
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,023
But...
- But what?

79
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,261
I see an obstacle.

80
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,554
What obstacle?
Tell me quickly, Guran.

81
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,598
Gauri!
- Later.

82
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,202
Read my fortune.

83
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,267
What is it, Kaka?

84
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,234
Was Guran telling
your fortune?

85
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,898
No... er... yes.

86
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,202
He's mad.

87
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,538
He's got no clue about the present
and just babbles about the future!

88
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,781
No, Hari Kaka. He's not mad.

89
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,249
Have you forgotten Aunt Durga?

90
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,911
She was childless for nine years
after marriage.

91
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,114
Then Guran said she'd have a son.

92
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,954
And wasn't Somu born?
Then there is Kesariya...

93
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:57,188
All right,
that lunatic is not mad.

94
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,693
Now tell me.
You saw Bhuvan anywhere?

95
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,966
I haven't seen him
but I know where he will be.

96
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:09,701
Amazing! Our little girl surely
keeps tabs on him, doesn't she?

97
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,970
Hey, Lakha! What is it to you?

98
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,309
I see! It concerns me and
I'm not to open my mouth!

99
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,983
Wear wedding bangles for me.

100
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:23,219
Lakha, what nonsense is this!

101
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,085
I really mean it, father.

102
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,719
Look. You've grown old
and our Gauri here doesn't care for me.

103
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,230
Here, look at this!

104
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,197
See how badly I am hurt.

105
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,258
Hurt?

106
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,905
It's my father you need, not me.

107
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,973
Bapu!
- What is it?

108
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,475
Lakha has a gash on his hand.

109
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:51,640
Well, Lakha. You seem to cut
your hand more than you chop wood.

110
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,752
What can I do, Isar Chacha!

111
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,288
I always seem to be wounding
myself... so badly.

112
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,788
Kaka, I'll go fetch Bhuvan.

113
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,760
Listen.
If you see him, tell him...

114
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,594
...Mai is waiting for him.

115
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,792
Yes, I'll tell him.

116
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,602
One...

117
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,805
Two...

118
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:58,740
Three.

119
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:02,821
Bloody hell! Missed again.
Quick! Before it disappears.

120
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,050
Over there!

121
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:07,321
Wesson, you go around.
Let's corner the blasted animal.

122
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:51,893
One...

123
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,534
Drop the stone.

124
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,350
Finally! Got the damn creature.

125
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:10,847
Good shot.
- Thank you.

126
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,392
Now for something a little bigger.

127
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:17,225
Arrest him.

128
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,598
Sir, this darkie was hiding
in the bushes...

129
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,332
...with this stone in his hand.

130
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,732
He'd been distracting
the deer all the time.

131
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,135
Now I understand...

132
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,343
...why I missed five times.

133
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,150
Protector of animals, eh?

134
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,915
He's a farmer, sir.
From Champaner.

135
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,151
Well, you must be
a very good runner.

136
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,438
Try saving this one.

137
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,187
Next time I will shoot you.

138
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:30,631
Captain Russell, sir.

139
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,069
Raja Puran Singhji is waiting
for you at the Cantonment.

140
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,039
Puran Singh!

141
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,100
What could he want now?

142
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:04,131
BHUVAN...!

143
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,239
BHUVAN...!

144
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,825
Why're you screaming
your head off?

145
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,490
I was looking for you.
Since I couldn't see you...

146
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,996
Was I lying dead somewhere!
- How should I know...

147
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,394
God! What am I saying.

148
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,234
But why are you so angry?

149
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,406
Oh, never mind.
What do you want?

150
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,778
I've got something special
to tell you.

151
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:47,845
What?

152
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,445
Sit down, won't you?

153
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,443
So tell me.

154
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:57,682
Guran read my fortune today.

155
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,756
So, what's the misfortune?

156
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,123
So mean! I won't tell you.

157
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:07,000
All right. Tell me.
Come on, tell me.

158
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,332
Guran said...

159
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:17,034
...I'll put henna on my hands
this year...

160
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,005
...I mean get married.

161
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:23,813
Wow! That's great!

162
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,008
Such happy news.

163
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:29,349
You'll be dancing with joy.
Who's the boy?

164
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,691
How would I know?

165
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,055
Guran didn't tell me that.

166
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:41,193
But Guran said for sure...

167
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:46,302
The house I marry into will have
a Neem tree in the courtyard...

168
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,572
A big field beside the house...

169
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:56,312
...two cows, a pair of oxen
and three goats.

170
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:03,079
Guran said my home
will be a little heaven.

171
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,088
How wonderful!
You're really lucky.

172
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,202
Lucky! You call this lucky?

173
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,699
Well, a little heaven of a home.
What more do you want?

174
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,500
God knows what'll become of me!

175
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:27,277
Well, Bhuvan, tell me one thing.
What kind of girl do you like?

176
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,204
I...

177
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:36,044
I will like only the girl
whom my Mai likes.

178
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,923
Whom Mai likes?
- Yes.

179
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,222
Oh, God!
- What happened?

180
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:44,555
Actually...

181
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,189
...I came to tell you that
your Mai wants you.

182
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:51,527
You tell me now
after all this time!

183
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,400
You sit here now.
I'm going.

184
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,633
Bhuvan, I am sorry!

185
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,085
Rajaji!

186
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,629
How did your hunt go?

187
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:23,798
The British are the best
when it comes to hunting.

188
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,065
The British Empire is
the best in the world.

189
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:27,970
Isn't that so?
- Absolutely.

190
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:31,167
But I am getting worried.
- About what?

191
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,170
When all the game in
the jungle is finished...

192
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,838
...what will your guns target next?

193
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,020
We're fortunate that
you came to visit us.

194
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,157
But I don't know the reason.

195
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:48,761
I've brought you a request
on behalf of my subjects.

196
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,088
Request?

197
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,091
Good morning, Eliza.
- Good morning.

198
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:55,965
Your Highness, may I present
my dear sister Elizabeth.

199
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,504
She just arrived from London.

200
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,804
Elizabeth, His Highness,
Raja Puran Singh Chala of Champaner.

201
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,071
It's my rare good fortune
to meet you.

202
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,703
Rajaji, she doesn't know Hindi.

203
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,773
Of course.
Charmed to meet you.

204
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,481
Pleased to meet you,
Your Highness.

205
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,919
Sir.
- Smith.

206
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,659
Elizabeth, I'd like you to meet
my deputy, Lieutenant Patrick Smith.

207
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,957
How do you do, Lieutenant Smith?
- Pleased to meet you.

208
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,091
Gentlemen.

209
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,468
Well, Rajaji.
I am at your service.

210
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:35,469
My people haven't worshipped
at the Siddheshwar temple...

211
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,769
...for the past three years.

212
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,737
They believe...

213
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,709
...performing puja will end
the hardships they faced last year.

214
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,085
But...
- But...

215
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:49,882
The temple is in the land ruled
by Raja Diler Singh...

216
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:52,456
...who is your cousin and enemy.

217
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,386
And your very dear friend.

218
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:02,233
I'm sure Diler Singh won't
say no if you talk to him.

219
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:05,799
No, thank you.
I'm a vegetarian.

220
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:08,034
I mean vegetarian.

221
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,511
So, what do you think, Captain Russell?
Is it possible?

222
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,481
Well, he could be persuaded.

223
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,942
Your work might be done.

224
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,180
But on one condition.

225
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:29,426
Condition? Yes, tell me.

226
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,621
Eat the meat, Your Highness.

227
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,534
You eat this meat...
and I'll talk to Diler Singh.

228
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:48,605
As I told you,
I'm a vegetarian.

229
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,547
I am a vegetarian!

230
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,650
Just one piece of meat.

231
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,615
You eat it
and consider your job done.

232
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,387
Andrew.

233
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,620
Eat the meat.

234
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,808
How's my eating meat
connected to the temple?

235
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:17,970
It's not connected.

236
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:21,180
I just want to see
you eating meat.

237
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:29,382
To do my duty,
I can't be false to my religion.

238
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:35,593
I'm sorry.

239
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:40,430
All right then.
You'll have to pay me double tax.

240
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:42,899
Double Lagaan...!?

241
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,500
Look, Rajaji!

242
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:49,732
Last year, I agreed to cut
the tax by half at your request.

243
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:51,939
And delayed, at that.

244
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:58,678
You have to clear the arrears
this year. So, double tax.

245
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,758
But it hasn't rained yet.

246
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:10,452
The British Raj doesn't bathe
in India's rains, Rajaji.

247
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:15,227
Rain or no rain.
I must maintain this Cantonment.

248
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,373
The army costs money.
It has to be paid, fed and clothed...

249
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,300
...for your protection.

250
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:28,738
How will the farmers pay?

251
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,417
Come on, Rajaji.

252
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:35,045
It's only double the tax.
And moreover...

253
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:38,448
...you don't eat meat, right?

254
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,921
Hey, Arjan.
What's Bagha so thrilled about?

255
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,652
I can't understand either.

256
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,490
It must surely be
something special.

257
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,760
Hey, Bagha!
What are you beating that drum for?

258
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,299
Clouds!

259
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,013
Dark and dense...

260
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,686
Dark and dense
come the swirling clouds

261
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:20,485
Darkly dense
roar the spreading clouds

262
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,220
The clouds'thunderous sting
reverberates

263
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,092
Oh, look!
How lethally does lightning flash

264
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:30,032
The clouds make my heart race

265
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,837
The clouds make every heart race

266
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,940
O black cloud!
Pour down rain

267
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:51,555
O black cloud!
Pour down rain

268
00:25:54,861 --> 00:26:00,390
Not lightning's flashy sword
wield the arrows of raindrops

269
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:06,101
The spreading clouds
bring rain in their wake

270
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:09,605
Swirling darkly
the clouds come

271
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:14,303
My leaping heart says

272
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:16,948
Dance with joy

273
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,719
Our days are transformed
Step out of the house

274
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:25,586
The clouds will
rain down nectar

275
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,963
Gone are days of hardship
Sing the melodies of monsoon

276
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:38,234
Dark and dense
come the swirling clouds

277
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,770
Darkly dense
roar the spreading clouds

278
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,310
When joyous rain pours

279
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,809
Who then will remain athirst!

280
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:25,281
The koel will sing
perched on the parapet

281
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,444
The songbirds will sing

282
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:32,181
Of the new days that are to come

283
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,992
Light shall smile at darkness

284
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,465
Love's rain will drench
hearts and bodies

285
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:43,124
On the earth
Oh, see, water's mirror

286
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:48,641
Wherever you go

287
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,404
You will see everywhere

288
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:53,705
This one splendid sight

289
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,510
The earth here wears
a rainbow-hued veil

290
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:26,671
Hang swings on the trees
and stretch your legs high

291
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:35,214
O black cloud!
Pour down rain

292
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:43,285
Not lightning's flashy sword
wield the arrows of raindrops

293
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:20,488
Now comes the intoxicating season

294
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,995
To spread a carpet of green

295
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,732
Bringing along
the season of rain

296
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,973
Anklets of lightning
adorn her dancing feet

297
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,511
The cloud is her veil

298
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,978
The season comes to bedeck
this bridal earth

299
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,648
Every bough will wear
a bracelet of blossoms

300
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,313
Joy will now rain
upon every courtyard

301
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:51,025
Now every bud will bloom

302
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,762
Every path will ring
with laughter now

303
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,167
The wafting breeze
makes the season balmy

304
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:01,000
Doused is the scorching heat
burning body and soul

305
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:10,949
O black cloud!
Pour down rain

306
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,463
Dark and dense
come the swirling clouds

307
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,130
Darkly dense
roar the spreading clouds

308
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,564
The clouds'thunderous sting
reverberates

309
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:34,136
Oh, look!
How lethally does lightning flash

310
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,531
Oh! Dear God!
We celebrated too soon.

311
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:07,029
One can't say
what God is punishing us for.

312
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,766
There'll be no rain this year too.

313
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,776
Bloody lunatic.

314
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:15,402
Always says inauspicious things!
- Black-tongued wretch!!

315
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,061
Hear! Hear this proclamation.

316
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,702
Orders of Raja Puran Singh,
your liege and master.

317
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:44,138
This year, you shall pay twice
the regular amount...

318
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,610
...of wheat, rice and maize.

319
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:50,212
The order of double Lagaan will
apply to the whole province.

320
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,915
How can this be possible!
- This is tyranny!

321
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,155
Double Lagaan!

322
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,822
Demon! Why don't you just skin
us alive, and be done with it!

323
00:32:03,996 --> 00:32:08,092
Our plight isn't hidden from the Raja.
Even then, double Lagaan!

324
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:16,939
What wrong have we done?
Why should we pay double?

325
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:20,942
We didn't pay tax on time last year.
And we paid only half.

326
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,776
But, father, it was Rajaji who waived it
because it didn't rain.

327
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:28,483
Sweets one year and
abuse the next!

328
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,313
It means we're being punished
for it now! Well done, Rajaji!!

329
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,652
Quiet, Lakha!

330
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,484
I won't hear one word against
our Rajaji.

331
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,490
He and his ancestors have
protected us all these years.

332
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,333
So? Was that any favour?

333
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,336
It's the tree's duty to shelter.

334
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,107
All I want to know is...

335
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,834
How long'll hungry stomachs
sing his praise! Fill his coffers!

336
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,946
Try and understand, Arjan.

337
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:58,845
This demand is the doing
of those damn White Sahibs.

338
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,113
Whether we put it into
the right hand or the left...

339
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,847
...it's we who pay, Chief!

340
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:11,686
I say we all go to the palace
and talk to him.

341
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,457
He's seen these clouds as well.

342
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:18,195
We'll say we can't pay Lagaan
this year. Not a grain!

343
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:24,468
What if Rajaji refuses even
after hearing us out?

344
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:29,546
Then all the separate fingers
will close into a fist, Chief.

345
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,410
Meaning? You'll fight?

346
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,348
If it's necessary, even that.

347
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,488
Have you gone crazy!

348
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,481
If you offend Rajaji...

349
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:41,024
...not only you - we will
all be ruined!

350
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:44,321
Is your life now all joy and comfort?
Aren't you suffering?

351
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:47,660
Whatever happens, I won't let
the whole village come to harm.

352
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,494
What do you want?

353
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:52,937
Sell our homes? Our cattle?
Even ourselves?

354
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,233
What justice is it to demand
double Lagaan?

355
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,652
Come on, Benson.
Pitch it up a bit.

356
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,655
Running.

357
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:21,393
Chief, there's our Rajaji.

358
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:26,536
Hey! Where're you going?

359
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:30,472
Please, brother, we've got to meet
His Highness. It's most urgent.

360
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,541
All right.
But the game is going on.

361
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:36,210
Sit here. You must wait till
the game gets over.

362
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:38,714
All of you sit down.

363
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:48,924
What are they playing?

364
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,087
God knows what
these Feringhees are playing.

365
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:58,860
It's rather like our game of
Gilli-Danda, you know.

366
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:04,738
Why're these Whitey buffoons
playing a kid's game then?

367
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:17,919
Any clouds up there?

368
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,026
Wasn't that a wonderful shot?

369
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:42,745
You are not supposed
to touch the ball.

370
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:59,557
Bloody darkie!
Arrest him!

371
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,435
Long live Your Highness.

372
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:10,298
What are you people doing here?

373
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:12,301
Forgive us, Your Highness.

374
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:15,914
We came to meet you,
not to see their silly stupid game.

375
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:19,249
We are desperately worried and
this Feringhee just hits Bhura!

376
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,811
I didn't like what you said.

377
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,088
Forgive them, Captain Russell.

378
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:28,154
They've come to me with their problems.
Their lot is sad.

379
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,420
And this boy is an innocent.

380
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:36,028
He's not so innocent...
It was you in the jungle, wasn't it?

381
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:41,595
All right.

382
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,337
We'll decide this after the game.

383
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:47,236
Leave him.

384
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,047
Come on, chaps.
Back to the game.

385
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:55,111
We'll talk after the game.

386
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,318
As you wish, Your Highness.

387
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:09,293
Well done, Smith.
Well done.

388
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:45,401
Long live Your Highness.

389
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,708
All right, Headman.
What's the matter?

390
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:56,004
You know there's been no rain
so far, Your Highness.

391
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,941
If we can live on what we have
this year...

392
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,246
...we may just be able to get by.

393
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:06,083
So, our liege lord!
We've come to plead with you...

394
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:09,853
Cancel our Lagaan this year.
You are like our father!

395
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,392
Listen, Headman.

396
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:17,561
I can understand
what you are all going through.

397
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:21,799
But... my hands are tied as well.

398
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:27,041
These Feringhees won't spare
even their own kin.

399
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:33,148
You'll have to pay double Lagaan.

400
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:37,051
We'll die of hunger!
- We'll starve!!

401
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,046
Problem, Your Highness?

402
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,588
These farmers have brought a petition.

403
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:44,751
And that is?

404
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,229
They want to be excused from
paying Lagaan this year.

405
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,766
I told them it's not possible.

406
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,470
But... it is possible.

407
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:57,901
How?

408
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,241
I will tell you.

409
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,478
All right. I'll cancel the tax.

410
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:14,349
But... there is a condition.

411
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:18,296
Condition!
What condition, Sahib?

412
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:20,954
You...

413
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,961
Come here.

414
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,108
What was that you said
about our game?

415
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:39,741
What did he say?

416
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:43,481
Yes... A silly stupid game.

417
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,884
What do you know about this game?

418
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,493
We've played it since we were children.
We call it Gilli-Danda.

419
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,898
And you... who knows what
you call it.

420
00:39:58,103 --> 00:39:59,331
Cricket!

421
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:06,806
So you mean to say
you can play this cricket?

422
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:12,350
Yes... it's easy.

423
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:17,017
All right.

424
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:23,484
I'll cancel the Lagaan...
But you must defeat us in the game.

425
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,155
The condition is...

426
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:33,662
You beat us at this game and
you won't have to pay Lagaan.

427
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,734
I'm serious.

428
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:46,007
You beat us in this game...

429
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,153
...and I'll cancel your tax.

430
00:40:57,396 --> 00:40:59,921
But if you lose...

431
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:07,964
You'll have to pay triple tax,
that is three times the Lagaan.

432
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:10,568
All right?

433
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,635
Tell me. You accept the wager?

434
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:32,061
Sir, I think the cat's
got his tongue.

435
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,360
Quiet.

436
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,997
All right. I will raise the stakes.

437
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:43,901
If you defeat us in this game...

438
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:48,906
...I'll cancel not only this year's
Lagaan but next year's as well.

439
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:52,845
Do you accept?

440
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:57,148
Bhuvan!
Don't say anything.

441
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:59,423
Don't say a word.
- Yes, just be silent.

442
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:07,191
All right.
I'll raise the bet even higher.

443
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,596
Not just one year...

444
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:16,340
I'll cancel Lagaan for the next
two years. That means three years!

445
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:21,635
And not just for you
but for the whole province.

446
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,348
Now do you accept?

447
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:30,050
He's digging a pit
to bury us in, Bhuvan.

448
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:33,356
Chief, you speak up now.
- Yes, Chief, you speak.

449
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,792
Sahib!

450
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:37,385
Shut up!

451
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:39,522
You tell me.

452
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,063
Will you pay double Lagaan?

453
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:47,965
Or do you accept the bet?

454
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,162
I accept the bet.

455
00:43:25,677 --> 00:43:28,271
Did he agree?
- Yes, he did.

456
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:30,213
All right.

457
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,717
So it's decided... the game will be
played after three months.

458
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:40,624
This'll kill us, Your Highness!
- We will die!

459
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,751
This is unfair.

460
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:47,364
So's life.

461
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:17,593
No Lagaan if you win.
But if you lose...

462
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:21,096
We have to pay thrice the amount!

463
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:24,099
And this Bhuvan here agreed
to this impossible condition!

464
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,265
What have you done, Bhuvan!?

465
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:27,735
From double to triple!

466
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:29,140
Total ruin!

467
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:32,172
I told you there could be
a great calamity, didn't I?

468
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,781
Was there any choice?
I ask you, did we have a choice?

469
00:44:40,152 --> 00:44:41,813
What else could we do?

470
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:44,616
Isn't double Lagaan unjust?

471
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:49,025
Are we strong enough to pay it?
Tell me, can anyone here pay it?

472
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:54,025
This isn't a calamity, Chief.
It's an opportunity. A chance.

473
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,530
I didn't accept out of bravado.

474
00:44:56,702 --> 00:44:59,830
You have to get burnt
to save your home from fire.

475
00:45:04,443 --> 00:45:06,343
I know we are weak.

476
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:08,843
But this way, we have hope.

477
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:12,181
And I want to turn this hope
into reality.

478
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:16,180
This game is for our fields
and harvest.

479
00:45:16,822 --> 00:45:20,656
Have you forgotten? If we win,
we'll be happy for three years.

480
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:22,020
Three years...

481
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,364
Just think.
No Lagaan for three years.

482
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:32,128
You know what that means?

483
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:35,705
It means our grain will be ours.
Only ours.

484
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,832
Not a grain to be given to anyone.

485
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:43,175
The welfare of our children,
our entire village, is in this.

486
00:45:43,882 --> 00:45:48,148
Our sweat will run as blood
in our veins.

487
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,514
Marvellous!

488
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:55,850
Small eyes dreaming
such big dreams!

489
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:59,253
Yes, Arjan, I have a dream.

490
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,031
And only those who dream
can make them come true.

491
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:08,061
Isar Kaka,
three months is time enough.

492
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:10,575
We can learn the game
and defeat them too.

493
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:14,906
Even a whole year's hitting with
a stick won't teach you...

494
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,274
...this Whitey game!

495
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:19,448
I know the game isn't easy, Lakha.

496
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:22,212
But, Chief, it's not impossible either.

497
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:25,049
I want all of you to be with me.

498
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:28,249
Nobody in the village will be
with you in your madness!

499
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:30,858
But, Ismayeel...
- Enough is enough!

500
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,161
We've only one hope now.

501
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:38,659
We'll all go to Rajaji once again
and beg him to save us.

502
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,423
What are you thinking, Mai?

503
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:13,370
About what happened today, son.

504
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,935
I swear on you, Mai!
I did what was right.

505
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,650
I feel rage in my heart
when I pay Lagaan to the Raja...

506
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,310
And he gives it to those Whiteys
with their dirty grasping hands!

507
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:32,122
You tell me, Mai.

508
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,087
Who ploughs this earth
to sow the seeds?

509
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,454
We do.

510
00:47:36,628 --> 00:47:38,619
Who waters it?
We do.

511
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:41,265
Why should we fill their coffers
with our produce?

512
00:47:46,004 --> 00:47:50,498
The White Sahib said Lagaan
may be cancelled for three years.

513
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,337
How could I remain silent, Mai?

514
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,973
Tell me, should I have stayed mute?

515
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,851
What are you looking at, Mai?

516
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:11,587
You talk just like your father.

517
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:17,093
He was so spirited.
And he spoke the truth.

518
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,007
Well, go and sleep now.

519
00:48:29,314 --> 00:48:31,179
Don't let this burden your heart.

520
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:03,542
Gauri! What are you doing here?

521
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:08,545
I came to meet you.

522
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:14,218
To... to tell you I am with you.

523
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:24,157
I have faith... in you
and in your courage.

524
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:40,348
That's all I came to say.

525
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,256
Bhuvan Bhaiyya, I lost my gilli.
Make me another.

526
00:50:24,796 --> 00:50:25,922
What's this?

527
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:30,896
I'll tell you.

528
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:19,279
It's not at all difficult, Tipu.

529
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:23,449
Whiteys play it wearing pants
and call it Kirkut.

530
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:26,885
And we wear loincloths
and call it Gilli-Danda. Get it?

531
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:32,296
Our fathers and grandfathers have
been playing Gilli-Danda.

532
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:36,731
Go over there...

533
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,266
Back... further back.

534
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:41,566
A little more... stop.

535
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,540
Now catch the ball, okay.

536
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,134
Catch it properly, Tipu.

537
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,941
Come on, toss it to me.
I'll show you.

538
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,780
Saw that?

539
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:02,519
It's very easy.
Why, even you can learn it.

540
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:04,820
This game is just like
Gilli-Danda.

541
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,430
Catch it now...

542
00:52:09,134 --> 00:52:09,964
Very good!

543
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,968
What a catch! What a catch!

544
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:16,772
Well done, Tipu.
Isn't it easy?

545
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:22,011
Now throw the ball.
I'll show you how to hit it.

546
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:43,328
Wow! That's some throw!
You do that so well, Tipu!

547
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:47,968
Hey, Gauri, pass it to me.

548
00:52:51,176 --> 00:52:55,909
Hey, Gauri! What're you doing?
Go heat the water.

549
00:53:05,023 --> 00:53:06,183
Take it, Tipu.

550
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:09,683
Now watch me this time.
It's very easy.

551
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,773
Damn! The stick slipped.

552
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:27,610
Oh! My hands are sweaty.

553
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,284
This should do the trick.

554
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,952
Okay, Tipu, throw.
And don't feel bad...

555
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,891
But I'll give it
a real hard whack this time.

556
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,619
A real hard whack, ha!

557
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,429
Wow!

558
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,250
Hey, Bagha, throw the ball.

559
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,940
Can I say something, father?
- What?

560
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:16,280
I feel that Bhuvan is doing
the right thing.

561
00:55:17,722 --> 00:55:20,520
All right, all right.
Go see if the water is boiling.

562
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:46,975
That's it, Bagha.
Hit it hard.

563
00:55:50,822 --> 00:55:52,346
Oh, very well done, Bagha!

564
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:14,076
Bhuvan, I am also with you...
like Bagha.

565
00:56:57,822 --> 00:56:59,619
Who are all these people, father?

566
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,817
Ramprasad and Namdeo.
Headmen ofTantpura and Bhind.

567
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,893
But with so many people...!

568
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:21,009
Who is Bhuvan here?
- That's Bhuvan.

569
00:57:25,283 --> 00:57:26,307
There he is!

570
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:37,758
Stop, Ramprasad.

571
00:57:39,097 --> 00:57:41,122
Think of the village
code of honour.

572
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:43,832
I've no quarrel with your village.

573
00:57:44,035 --> 00:57:46,026
I must teach that cocky Bhuvan
of yours a lesson.

574
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:50,868
Why should we suffer for
what he's done?

575
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:54,468
You big mouth!
Who are you to decide for us?

576
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:56,972
I have only done what is
good for all of us.

577
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:58,809
To hell with your do-gooding!

578
00:57:59,117 --> 00:58:01,711
You must beg the White Sahib's pardon.

579
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,452
And as for your game,
to hell with it! Understand?

580
00:58:04,956 --> 00:58:07,481
No? You are asking for
trouble now.

581
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:11,122
Be calm, Ramprasad.
It'll be as you say.

582
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,853
But, Chief...
- Enough is enough!

583
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,059
No more buts!

584
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:21,328
We must go to our Rajaji.

585
00:58:25,576 --> 00:58:29,307
The issue now is not Lagaan
or the game...

586
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:33,174
...but of British honour.

587
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,916
And Captain Russell's ego.

588
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:42,584
Talk to the White Sahib
once more, Your Highness.

589
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:45,660
Forgive him, Your Highness.
Bhuvan is naive, impulsive.

590
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,024
He got carried away.

591
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,931
It doesn't matter what he is.

592
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:53,535
He has challenged the British
on behalf of you all.

593
00:58:54,038 --> 00:58:57,565
He's ready to beg the British
Sahib's pardon. All of us are.

594
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,775
I'll agree to 100 whiplashes...

595
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:03,846
But I won't beg pardon.

596
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,448
What're you saying, Bhuvan!

597
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:07,447
It's too late to beg pardon.

598
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:10,718
Now pay for what you've done.

599
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,554
But what shall we do, Highness?

600
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,062
I suggest... you learn their game.

601
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:32,304
Why're all these other guys
standing around on the field?

602
00:59:32,877 --> 00:59:37,280
Like in Gilli-Danda, to catch
the gilli... I mean the ball.

603
00:59:41,652 --> 00:59:43,449
That is out, sir.

604
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:50,627
Why does he point his finger
at the sky?

605
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,319
That's what I'm
trying to understand.

606
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,731
He must be thinking of his Ma.
She's sitting up there, huh?

607
00:59:59,337 --> 01:00:01,430
Bowl it on the offside.

608
01:00:27,932 --> 01:00:29,832
Excuse me.
I might just take a walk.

609
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:31,391
Of course, my dear.

610
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,510
Damn! This bug's after me!

611
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:52,578
Be quiet.

612
01:00:58,763 --> 01:01:01,664
Look! The White lady is
coming here.

613
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,438
Damn! It got in!

614
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:18,548
Hell!! Out!

615
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:27,587
Miss, what happened?

616
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:29,319
Are these darkies bothering you?

617
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:32,590
It's all right. They're farmers.
I know them.

618
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:34,654
Thank you. Carry on your game.

619
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:44,100
I know what you were doing
behind that tree.

620
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:45,836
You were trying to learn the game.

621
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,441
No, Memsahib. We were only
trying to understand the game.

622
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:55,684
Oh, I thought you were
trying to learn the game.

623
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,619
What's she saying,
Bhuvan Bhaiyya?

624
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:03,552
I think she is telling us to go.

625
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,555
All right, Memsahib.
We'll go.

626
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,655
No, wait.

627
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:11,624
Ram Singh!

628
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,142
Yes, Memsahib.
What can I do?

629
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,303
Ram Singh, I want you to tell them...

630
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,643
...that I would like to help them
learn the game.

631
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:24,874
Yes, Memsahib.

632
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,918
Memsahib says she'll help
you understand this...

633
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:39,128
What if your brother learns
of this, Memsahib!

634
01:02:39,897 --> 01:02:42,092
Ram Singh, can I trust you?

635
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,827
Of course, Memsahib.

636
01:02:43,901 --> 01:02:46,495
No one should know about this.

637
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:50,374
All right, Memsahib.

638
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:51,972
No one will know.

639
01:02:55,212 --> 01:02:59,114
Memsahib says she wants to
help you understand this game.

640
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:00,873
Really?

641
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,045
But why?
Isn't she Feringhee too?

642
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,421
The man wants to know...

643
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:11,859
...why would you want to do this
as you, too, are British.

644
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,897
Tell him... because I know
what happened to them is unfair...

645
01:03:18,703 --> 01:03:21,069
...and I want to give them
a fair chance.

646
01:03:21,138 --> 01:03:24,403
Memsahib knows injustice
has been done to you.

647
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,043
That's why she wants to give
you an equal chance.

648
01:03:29,647 --> 01:03:31,877
Thank you. We'd be very happy.

649
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,676
He's happy to receive your help
and he thanks you.

650
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:36,742
Good.

651
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:38,386
Wonderful!

652
01:03:39,657 --> 01:03:42,159
Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

653
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,390
Same time but not here.

654
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:47,863
And certainly not in their village.

655
01:03:47,932 --> 01:03:49,957
Some other place maybe?

656
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,059
Memsahib will meet you
tomorrow at the same time.

657
01:03:52,503 --> 01:03:55,995
But not here. Nor in the village.
Have you any other place?

658
01:03:57,908 --> 01:04:01,537
I got it.
Behind the hill near the village.

659
01:04:02,947 --> 01:04:07,475
You can meet him next to the hill,
near the village.

660
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:09,678
I know the place.
- All right.

661
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:13,679
What's his name?

662
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,184
Memsahib wants to know
your names.

663
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:20,854
He's Guran, that's Bagha.
This is Tipu.

664
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:22,430
And I am Bhuvan.

665
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:26,296
No, no! Bhuvan.

666
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,805
Bhu... van.

667
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,476
There! That one sprouted right, huh?

668
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:39,748
My name is Elizabeth.

669
01:04:39,817 --> 01:04:41,216
Memsahib's name is Elizabeth.

670
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,044
Ali... and what?

671
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:47,722
My God! My tongue'll get
into a twist saying it!

672
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:52,218
It's a nice name...
Whatever it may be.

673
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,134
All right, Memsahib.
We're going. Namaste.

674
01:05:17,221 --> 01:05:19,621
He'll never agree, Bhuvan.

675
01:05:25,062 --> 01:05:26,324
He will agree.

676
01:05:29,233 --> 01:05:31,929
Greetings, Bhabhi.
- How're you, Bhuvan Bhaiyya?

677
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,263
What're you up to, you imp?

678
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,737
Have you eaten, Goli?
- Yes.

679
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,509
I didn't see you all day,
Bhuvan Bhaiyya.

680
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,940
What to do. I was busy
preparing for the game.

681
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,276
How's your game coming along?

682
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:53,456
It's just the beginning.
We're learning the ropes.

683
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,593
Do you know everyone here
is making fun of you?

684
01:06:00,764 --> 01:06:02,857
They say, "Some players
Bhuvan has got, ha!"

685
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:05,092
One's Bagha and the other, Guran!

686
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:07,499
One can do nothing else
but beat a drum.

687
01:06:07,671 --> 01:06:10,435
And the other keeps staring
like a madman.

688
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:15,539
Oh, no. It's not me,
the others say all this.

689
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:16,902
Is that so!

690
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:21,318
We also have a White lady with us.
She teaches us the game.

691
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:23,877
A White lady?

692
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:26,980
Don't tell me tall tales!

693
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:28,856
What do you think? Ask them.

694
01:06:32,496 --> 01:06:33,520
Is this true, Gauri?

695
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:37,492
Yes. There's some White lady.

696
01:06:40,337 --> 01:06:41,634
That means you will really play?

697
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:45,339
Is there a choice?

698
01:06:46,677 --> 01:06:50,204
I don't have so much land like
you that I can sell off a piece!

699
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,375
What do you mean?

700
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,348
Why should I sell my land?
I'm not selling any land!

701
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,187
Will your Granny pay the double
Lagaan then?

702
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:07,925
Well, I'd better be off.

703
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:13,527
Hey, Bhuvan.

704
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,007
Do you think I could be
of any use?

705
01:07:18,175 --> 01:07:20,268
No! Your buffalo would
be more useful!

706
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:22,935
Silly, you will be the
most useful of all!

707
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,078
Really! How?

708
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,513
You'll throw the ball the way you
swing that slingshot of yours.

709
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:29,243
What aim! It's deadly!

710
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:33,045
Slingshot...

711
01:07:37,294 --> 01:07:40,525
Then... we won't have
to pay Lagaan?

712
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:42,063
Yes, Goli.

713
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,299
We'll eat our bellyful.

714
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:52,965
Will our dream ever come true?

715
01:07:54,712 --> 01:07:57,704
No, Bhuvan. It hurts too much
to dream like that.

716
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:02,249
Have faith, Goli.

717
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,614
He who has truth and courage
in his heart shall win in the end.

718
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:09,553
Beautifully said!

719
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:24,398
Every saint and seer has said

720
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:31,675
He who has truth and courage
in his heart

721
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:40,685
It's he who wins
at the end

722
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:02,669
Come, yes, come on

723
01:09:04,214 --> 01:09:07,377
However long the path may be

724
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:10,149
This body of yours
shall not grow weary

725
01:09:12,556 --> 01:09:17,220
Come. Hear the call
of the road

726
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:21,463
Let not the road
remain waiting for you

727
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:22,859
You come along

728
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,859
You are the king of this earth

729
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:29,230
Know this for sure

730
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:32,407
Go forth to meet hardship
head on

731
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,871
Don't ever accept defeat

732
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:37,870
Listen, O my friend

733
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,683
What's this fear you have?

734
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:45,387
This earth is ours
So is the sky

735
01:09:46,757 --> 01:09:51,057
Listen, O my friend
What's this fear you have?

736
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,494
You just come along

737
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:37,930
Hear me, O my friend

738
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:45,215
What's in your heart
is in my heart too

739
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:50,579
The dream you have
is also my dream in life

740
01:10:56,426 --> 01:11:02,058
Yes, we go ahead
with hope lit in our eyes

741
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,669
May this light of our hope
never go out

742
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:12,900
May never a storm
put out this light

743
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:21,174
Listen, O my friend
What's this fear you have?

744
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:26,779
This earth is ours
So is the sky

745
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,050
Listen to this, my friend

746
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,051
The balmy easterly breeze
will join our song

747
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,887
Pleasure will cast
its intoxicating spell

748
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:40,495
If we call out in unison...

749
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:45,931
The season of flowers
will also come

750
01:12:47,938 --> 01:12:48,768
Oh, yes

751
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:54,841
Happy days shall be here again
with no trace of sorrow

752
01:12:56,213 --> 01:13:00,411
Let's all together create
a festival ofjoyous colour

753
01:13:01,685 --> 01:13:05,849
Tell me why you stay
alone this way

754
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:12,223
Listen, O my friend
What's this fear you have?

755
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:17,766
This earth is ours
So is the sky

756
01:13:34,418 --> 01:13:37,319
Every saint has said

757
01:13:38,155 --> 01:13:42,148
As has every seer

758
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:49,121
He who has truth and courage
in his heart

759
01:13:52,436 --> 01:13:55,803
It's he who wins
at the end

760
01:15:08,011 --> 01:15:09,638
The lady hasn't come yet.

761
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,704
I am here!

762
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,680
Not you, silly.
We're waiting for the White lady.

763
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,716
Not a lassie but a lady!

764
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,416
She has come, Bhuvan Bhaiyya!

765
01:15:31,234 --> 01:15:32,826
Tell me this, Bhuvan.

766
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:36,271
Why's that White witch
ready to help you?

767
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,102
Simple. She took a fancy to
Bhuvan Bhaiyya.

768
01:15:39,443 --> 01:15:40,569
Is that so?

769
01:15:40,944 --> 01:15:42,104
Cheeky brat!

770
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:16,276
Who are they?

771
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:19,548
Oh, wow! You learnt
our language very fast.

772
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,442
Ram Singh taught me.

773
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,680
Who are they?

774
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:27,452
You already know Tipu,
Bagha and Guran.

775
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,526
This is Goli, he's Isar Kaka.
And this is Gauri.

776
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:36,096
We'll meet again.

777
01:16:39,903 --> 01:16:42,565
You should say,
I'm glad to meet you.

778
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:46,900
Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry.

779
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:49,241
I'm glad to meet you.

780
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:51,781
We're glad to meet you too.

781
01:16:54,284 --> 01:16:57,913
So, Bhuvan,
what do you know about the game?

782
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:58,977
What?

783
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:02,990
Memsahib is asking you
what you know about the game.

784
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,388
Oh, lots!

785
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:07,925
There are six sticks.
Three this side and three that side.

786
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:11,829
Two fellows stand with planks
before the sticks.

787
01:17:12,269 --> 01:17:15,397
One comes running near
the sticks and throws a ball.

788
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:18,501
The chap with the plank hits
the ball hard with his plank...

789
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,939
...and then everyone runs
helter-skelter.

790
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:24,802
One of them grabs the ball
and gives it to the first guy.

791
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:29,008
He runs again to throw the ball
at the guy who twirls the plank.

792
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,445
That's all. It goes on all day.

793
01:17:31,621 --> 01:17:35,182
Throw the ball, twirl the plank.
Throw and twirl! Right?

794
01:17:35,725 --> 01:17:39,354
Memsahib, I can't translate all that.

795
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:42,887
No need, Ram Singh.
I understood most of that.

796
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:45,761
He knows nothing.

797
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:51,767
This is what a cricket field looks like.

798
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:53,468
Suppose this is the playing field.

799
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,738
And this is what a cricket pitch is.

800
01:17:55,812 --> 01:17:58,144
This is the strip on which
the game is played.

801
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,479
There are three main aspects
to cricket:

802
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,610
Batting, bowling and fielding.

803
01:18:03,687 --> 01:18:05,814
The game has three parts.

804
01:18:05,989 --> 01:18:09,652
Wielding the bat, bowling
the ball and guarding the field.

805
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:13,762
My God! Even our great uncles
can't pronounce these things!

806
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:16,364
What did he say?

807
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:19,664
He said this language even
his ancestors won't understand.

808
01:18:22,105 --> 01:18:24,369
All right, we better make it simpler.

809
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:29,141
Cricket is played by two teams,
say, yours and the English.

810
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:35,540
Each team has eleven players.
Five batters, five bowlers...

811
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:12,818
Yes...

812
01:19:13,056 --> 01:19:14,023
What happened?

813
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:16,990
What happened?

814
01:19:19,396 --> 01:19:20,385
Nothing.

815
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:24,627
Memsahib, I think we should leave.
It's getting late.

816
01:19:25,402 --> 01:19:27,768
This is enough for today.

817
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:31,341
Let's begin with the Lord's
name on our lips.

818
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,242
Let's begin with the Lord's
name on our lips.

819
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,900
Catch it.

820
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:42,516
Look. Try pouncing on the ball
and catch. Don't let it fall.

821
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,916
Bhuvan, the White lady said
there must be eleven in a team.

822
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,656
We are only five.

823
01:19:50,093 --> 01:19:51,924
Why only five? I'm here too.

824
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:55,362
Whatever that White lady can do,
so can I.

825
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:58,533
All right, Gauri.
We're six, not five.

826
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:02,633
Isar Kaka, as you thought of
our village and joined us...

827
01:20:02,806 --> 01:20:05,604
The others will also come
and join.

828
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:07,299
Or we will drag them in.

829
01:20:07,477 --> 01:20:08,535
Hey, Goli!

830
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:10,472
Catch the ball.

831
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:34,704
Who threw this ball?
- Goli Chacha did.

832
01:20:36,906 --> 01:20:40,672
Goli, you jackass!
I won't leave you today.

833
01:20:41,411 --> 01:20:43,504
There it starts again!

834
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,375
I'll crack you open like an egg!

835
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:50,710
Will you stop your
infernal squabbling!

836
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,917
Isar Kaka, don't you interfere.
- Stop it, you fools!

837
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,732
Gauri, our sixth player.

838
01:21:07,537 --> 01:21:08,561
Hey, Bhura.

839
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,929
Oh, wow!

840
01:21:13,109 --> 01:21:16,340
You saw how a ball is to
be caught, Isar Kaka?

841
01:21:16,513 --> 01:21:19,846
That was something to see!
Like a bird diving for fish.

842
01:21:20,016 --> 01:21:22,109
Oh, that's how it's done, is it?

843
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:25,084
Of course! Here, Bhura, do it again.

844
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,349
Show them all,
'specially this Goli here.

845
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:31,553
He's hopeless.
Just doesn't know how to catch.

846
01:21:31,728 --> 01:21:34,219
All of you come here and
watch carefully.

847
01:21:35,231 --> 01:21:37,256
Get ready, Bhura.

848
01:21:41,037 --> 01:21:42,026
Watch carefully.

849
01:21:43,473 --> 01:21:44,462
Saw that?

850
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:47,975
Brilliant, Bhura!
- That was something!

851
01:21:48,244 --> 01:21:50,075
But where did you learn it?

852
01:21:51,214 --> 01:21:52,545
I'll tell you.

853
01:21:53,383 --> 01:21:57,149
The ball comes straight.
But hens! They run zigzag.

854
01:21:58,154 --> 01:22:01,123
To catch hens,
you've got to be quick and agile...

855
01:22:01,424 --> 01:22:02,618
...like Bhura.

856
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,727
Bhura will teach us all now,
won't you, Bhura?

857
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,889
I'll teach you... but...

858
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:10,993
But what?

859
01:22:13,736 --> 01:22:15,294
What about my hens?

860
01:22:16,773 --> 01:22:19,765
Bhura, these hens of yours
are a real pain!

861
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:30,376
Hearing of the wager and
cancellation of Lagaan...

862
01:22:30,553 --> 01:22:33,021
...all the senior officers were
greatly concerned.

863
01:22:34,257 --> 01:22:38,057
Colonel Boyer, Major Warren
and Major Cotton summoned...

864
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:41,789
...Captain Russell to express
their anger at his audacity.

865
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:52,067
At ease, Captain.

866
01:22:52,575 --> 01:22:56,306
You know Major Cotton.
That is Major Warren.

867
01:22:58,081 --> 01:22:59,571
Take a seat.

868
01:23:04,554 --> 01:23:07,182
Now, what is this we hear?

869
01:23:07,757 --> 01:23:12,524
That you have agreed to cancel the tax
of the farmers in Champaner...

870
01:23:12,595 --> 01:23:15,393
...if they beat you
in a game of cricket?

871
01:23:15,765 --> 01:23:17,096
Is this true?

872
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:20,535
Yes, Colonel Boyer, sir, it is.

873
01:23:20,603 --> 01:23:24,039
What on earth do you think
you're here for? To play games?

874
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:26,166
Let me remind you...

875
01:23:26,242 --> 01:23:29,336
...that you are working here
for Her Majesty, the queen.

876
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:33,439
Your job is to ensure
the smooth running of your province.

877
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:36,383
Pardon me, sir,
but that's exactly what I'm doing.

878
01:23:36,452 --> 01:23:38,682
I think we'll be
the judge of that, Russell.

879
01:23:39,822 --> 01:23:44,589
We also understand that if you lose
this so-called match...

880
01:23:44,661 --> 01:23:47,960
...you will cancel their taxes
for the next three years.

881
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:51,694
Not just Champaner
but the entire province.

882
01:23:51,768 --> 01:23:53,736
But they won't win.

883
01:23:53,803 --> 01:23:56,567
You're missing the whole bloody point.

884
01:23:57,006 --> 01:24:02,239
Do you realize we could have
on our hands a bloody situation...

885
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:06,874
...of cricket matches all over the damn
subcontinent to cancel the bloody tax!

886
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,913
But there's one thing you don't know.
If they lose...

887
01:24:10,987 --> 01:24:16,550
...which they will, they will have
to pay the queen three times the tax.

888
01:24:16,626 --> 01:24:21,529
This is ridiculous! This officer
wants to make the government...

889
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:25,895
...into some kind of bookie
with whom he can place his wagers.

890
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:28,904
What would you have us do next?
Race horses?

891
01:24:28,972 --> 01:24:31,600
This is the most preposterous idea
I've ever heard of.

892
01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:34,940
Captain Russell, the British Empire
cannot function according to...

893
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:37,411
...the whims and fancies
of officers like you.

894
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:40,174
Now jolly well understand this.

895
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,784
If you win,
you will have had a narrow escape...

896
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:49,450
...but if you lose, you will pay
the taxes for Champaner...

897
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:52,426
...and the entire province
out of your own pocket.

898
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:55,362
And then you'll be packed off
to Central Africa.

899
01:24:55,431 --> 01:24:56,591
Is that clear?

900
01:24:57,567 --> 01:24:58,727
Yes, sir.

901
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,127
That'll be all.
You may go.

902
01:25:04,374 --> 01:25:08,071
It was against British pride
to withdraw from this wager.

903
01:25:09,412 --> 01:25:12,245
And so, Captain Russell
was warned...

904
01:25:12,415 --> 01:25:15,441
If he won the game,
he'd have a narrow escape.

905
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:19,816
But if he lost,
he'd have to pay the triple tax...

906
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,753
...of the entire province
from his own pocket.

907
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:23,892
Moreover...

908
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,463
He'd be transferred to
the Central African desert.

909
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:45,003
Is that the way a soldier behaves?

910
01:25:45,081 --> 01:25:48,312
You're supposed to salute
when a superior officer passes.

911
01:25:48,384 --> 01:25:50,750
I did, sir.
- I didn't see it.

912
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:54,987
That's better.

913
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:57,652
I imagine your meeting
did not quite go as expected, sir.

914
01:25:57,727 --> 01:25:58,887
Damn right.

915
01:25:58,961 --> 01:26:02,158
The senile old hats want
to teach me how to run the show.

916
01:26:02,231 --> 01:26:04,791
They've lost their sense of adventure
with age.

917
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:07,700
What's wrong with a little fun
along with the Lagaan?

918
01:26:08,805 --> 01:26:11,365
Is the match cancelled, sir?
- No, of course not.

919
01:26:14,744 --> 01:26:17,679
Hey! How dare you hurt my horse!

920
01:26:20,983 --> 01:26:24,384
I'm going to destroy
you people now!

921
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:29,787
I'll take so much Lagaan
you won't have a rag to your backs!

922
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:38,731
You bloody slaves will remain
crushed under our boots!

923
01:26:55,918 --> 01:27:03,154
However thick the sole, it wears out.
Then nails will begin to prick, Sahib!

924
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:05,754
Ram Singh!

925
01:27:07,196 --> 01:27:08,356
Yes, sir.

926
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:11,457
Get him out of here
before I kill him.

927
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:43,721
Arjan. What happened?

928
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,700
Bhuvan, I've been blind and stupid.

929
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:53,238
I am with you now.
Tell me in what way I can be of help.

930
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,703
Very good! We're coming
together to form a fist.

931
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,213
No, Arjan! Not like that.

932
01:28:23,072 --> 01:28:25,973
Lakha, Goli was telling the truth.

933
01:28:26,242 --> 01:28:28,472
About what?
- The White lady.

934
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:30,773
So?

935
01:28:36,819 --> 01:28:41,950
We did wrong, Lakha. But it's
still in our hands to put it right.

936
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:44,021
We must support Bhuvan.

937
01:28:45,661 --> 01:28:48,152
What did you say?
Have you gone crazy!

938
01:28:48,598 --> 01:28:50,259
Try to understand.

939
01:28:51,267 --> 01:28:52,427
Look!

940
01:28:54,036 --> 01:28:58,700
An English girl is helping us
to save our bodies and souls.

941
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:03,677
And we sit sulking!
Shame on us!

942
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:11,783
By Allah's command,
we must be with him.

943
01:29:13,623 --> 01:29:15,056
Come with me. Come on.

944
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,723
Have you gone senile, Ismayeel?

945
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:22,528
Then get yourself a crutch
and a shroud too!

946
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:28,735
This Bhuvan of yours will
never succeed.

947
01:29:33,342 --> 01:29:37,301
Ismayeel... he'll never
take you into his team!

948
01:29:41,651 --> 01:29:42,982
Now catch this.

949
01:29:47,056 --> 01:29:48,489
Look, Bhuvan...

950
01:29:49,558 --> 01:29:53,585
It's not just your honour at stake,
it's the whole village.

951
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:58,499
I'm ashamed of all the things
I said the other day.

952
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:03,333
I swear by God, I am with you
in this effort.

953
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,701
It's the word of a man of prayer.

954
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,502
What a beautiful thing to say!

955
01:30:07,677 --> 01:30:09,611
Ismayeel has raised our spirit,
hasn't he.

956
01:30:10,413 --> 01:30:12,074
Who can stop us now!

957
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:29,697
With a procession of
elephants and horses...

958
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:32,390
Raise a cry of victory
to Lord Krishna.

959
01:30:50,419 --> 01:30:52,250
What are you looking at, Memsahib?

960
01:30:52,788 --> 01:30:56,383
These statues.
Whose images are these?

961
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:59,252
This is the temple of
Radha and Krishna.

962
01:30:59,428 --> 01:31:00,952
They are statues of
Lord Krishna and Radha.

963
01:31:02,398 --> 01:31:05,561
Today is Krishna's birthday.
So the idols are decorated.

964
01:31:07,103 --> 01:31:08,661
It's very beautiful.

965
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:12,973
Were they husband and wife?

966
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:14,809
Oh, no, Memsahib.

967
01:31:14,977 --> 01:31:18,310
Krishna was married to Rukmini
and Radha married Anay.

968
01:31:19,615 --> 01:31:24,018
But the deep love they had for
each other has set an ideal.

969
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:29,484
It's like the dewdrop
on a lotus leaf...

970
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:34,155
...not united nor separated.

971
01:31:35,297 --> 01:31:38,266
They have been worshipped
together from aeons.

972
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:09,324
Let's go.

973
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:33,154
If Krishna were to meet
a lovelorn Gopi in the grove

974
01:32:33,389 --> 01:32:37,519
And then smile and talk
and even tease her

975
01:32:38,227 --> 01:32:39,854
How can Radha
be not jealous!

976
01:32:40,563 --> 01:32:42,428
How can Radha
be not jealous!

977
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:44,829
For her body and heart
are on fire

978
01:32:54,176 --> 01:32:58,374
Even if Krishna were to meet
a lovelorn Gopi in the grove

979
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,945
It's only the flower of Radha's love
that blooms in his heart

980
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:05,517
Then why is Radha jealous?

981
01:33:08,424 --> 01:33:10,449
With no thought or reason

982
01:33:11,026 --> 01:33:13,358
Why is Radha jealous?

983
01:33:42,424 --> 01:33:46,588
All the Gopis are but stars
Radha is the moon

984
01:33:47,329 --> 01:33:51,060
Why is her faith
then so half-hearted?

985
01:34:04,413 --> 01:34:08,179
Faithless Krishna is forever
looking hither and thither

986
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:13,350
Then how can poor Radha
believe in herself.

987
01:34:14,089 --> 01:34:17,855
Gopis come and go
but Radha queens over his heart

988
01:34:23,365 --> 01:34:25,629
Dawn and dusk
by theJamuna's banks

989
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:28,029
It's only Radha
that Krishna calls out to

990
01:34:30,005 --> 01:34:34,169
If someone garlands Krishna
with her entwined arms

991
01:34:34,777 --> 01:34:38,611
How can Radha
be not jealous!

992
01:34:39,648 --> 01:34:41,878
Her body and heart
are on fire

993
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,212
How can Radha
be not jealous?

994
01:35:29,431 --> 01:35:33,197
If Radha is enshrined
in Krishna's heart

995
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,664
Why doesn't he then tell her so?

996
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:43,235
Love has its own language
its own expression

997
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:47,873
Let the eyes speak
Such is Krishna's sweet wish

998
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,541
These eyes of yours, O Krishna!

999
01:35:50,753 --> 01:35:52,948
They destroy the peace
of many a Gopi's heart

1000
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,251
She meets your eyes
and is lost in love

1001
01:36:00,429 --> 01:36:02,727
Even if she be
the fairest damsel

1002
01:36:03,065 --> 01:36:07,058
If love for Krishna
ripens in a Gopi's heart

1003
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,968
Why is Radha jealous?

1004
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:14,702
How can Radha
be not jealous!

1005
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:32,947
Gauri, you sing and dance beautifully!

1006
01:38:31,547 --> 01:38:34,448
Elizabeth, this is
Lieutenant Edward Wesson.

1007
01:38:34,516 --> 01:38:36,609
This is Lieutenant Richard North.

1008
01:38:36,685 --> 01:38:38,676
How do you do?
- Charmed, I'm sure.

1009
01:38:38,754 --> 01:38:42,087
Excuse me. Sir, there's a villager
outside you have to speak with.

1010
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:44,649
Not now.
Tomorrow, in the office.

1011
01:38:44,726 --> 01:38:49,390
Sir, he says he has some important
information about the match.

1012
01:38:51,633 --> 01:38:53,294
Excuse me.

1013
01:39:05,113 --> 01:39:07,604
Long live our Protector.

1014
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:10,645
What's the news you want
to give me?

1015
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:13,788
Bhuvan is building up
his team, Sahib. But...

1016
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,118
But what?

1017
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:18,153
Spare my life, Sahib!

1018
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:22,994
But a White Memsahib
from here teaches them the game.

1019
01:39:24,299 --> 01:39:25,493
White Memsahib...!?

1020
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:29,066
Yes, Sahib.
I saw it with my own eyes today.

1021
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:32,173
She also came to attend
the puja at our temple today.

1022
01:39:46,622 --> 01:39:48,647
Is the White Memsahib among them?

1023
01:39:54,963 --> 01:39:56,021
There she is.

1024
01:40:01,136 --> 01:40:03,104
You are not making a mistake, are you?

1025
01:40:03,272 --> 01:40:05,502
Hang me on the cross
if I've made a mistake.

1026
01:40:06,008 --> 01:40:07,805
She is the one,
I swear on my mother!

1027
01:40:13,849 --> 01:40:15,214
So you too are in the team.

1028
01:40:15,851 --> 01:40:18,149
No, Sahib.
As if I'm crazy like Bhuvan...

1029
01:40:18,487 --> 01:40:21,285
...to challenge the might of
the government!

1030
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:24,657
Why are you telling me all this?

1031
01:40:26,995 --> 01:40:30,556
Only the slaughtered beast knows
the agony of the knife, Master.

1032
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,558
And I am being cut from inside.

1033
01:40:34,036 --> 01:40:38,370
Just say that my victory
lies in Bhuvan's defeat.

1034
01:40:46,315 --> 01:40:47,976
What is your name?

1035
01:40:48,183 --> 01:40:49,377
Your name?

1036
01:40:50,052 --> 01:40:51,076
Lakha, Sahib.

1037
01:40:52,354 --> 01:40:55,380
Lakha, you do this.

1038
01:40:56,892 --> 01:40:59,019
You join Bhuvan's team.

1039
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:01,893
What are you saying, Sahib!

1040
01:41:02,064 --> 01:41:06,728
You will be in Bhuvan's team.
But you will work for me.

1041
01:41:13,942 --> 01:41:15,170
I understand, Sahib.

1042
01:41:27,923 --> 01:41:31,620
Yes, Andrew, what is it?

1043
01:41:31,927 --> 01:41:34,225
So, Eliza,
you've been sightseeing.

1044
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:36,757
How's the countryside?

1045
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,368
It's beautiful.

1046
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,365
The mountains, the woods, the cattle...

1047
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:46,498
And the villages?

1048
01:41:48,243 --> 01:41:51,770
I didn't see any villages.
- My foot, you didn't see any!

1049
01:41:51,847 --> 01:41:55,010
You were with the villagers and
what's-his-name teaching them cricket.

1050
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:57,051
You thought I wouldn't come to know?

1051
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,145
You have the audacity
to go against your own brother?

1052
01:42:00,589 --> 01:42:02,716
Listen to me carefully.

1053
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,722
You will not be meeting
those villagers again...

1054
01:42:05,794 --> 01:42:07,785
...because you will not be leaving...

1055
01:42:07,863 --> 01:42:11,060
...the Cantonment.
Is that understood?

1056
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,778
Bloody farmers.

1057
01:42:54,943 --> 01:42:58,435
Why're you worried, child?
Our game's improving day by day.

1058
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:01,538
Goli, you throw the ball
with a lot of passion.

1059
01:43:03,318 --> 01:43:06,913
Why do you just stand
after hitting, Arjan?

1060
01:43:07,889 --> 01:43:09,083
Take off and run.

1061
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:15,795
Bhuvan... Bhaiyya.

1062
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:21,900
Today when I see you all
playing together...

1063
01:43:22,771 --> 01:43:24,671
...I am aware of the wrong I did.

1064
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,235
I regret it very much.

1065
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:31,443
Can... Can I play with you?

1066
01:43:40,956 --> 01:43:43,481
No... you can't play.

1067
01:43:44,092 --> 01:43:45,081
Why?

1068
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,590
See the game and understand, Lakha.

1069
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,697
It's not like chopping wood, you know.

1070
01:43:49,865 --> 01:43:52,595
It needs special skills.
What do you say, huh?

1071
01:43:53,135 --> 01:43:54,295
Yes, absolutely!

1072
01:43:55,036 --> 01:43:56,503
Take Goli now.

1073
01:43:56,938 --> 01:44:00,772
He whirls and twirls the ball
like he swings his slingshot!

1074
01:44:01,309 --> 01:44:02,537
And our Bhura here.

1075
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:06,841
He pounces on the ball the way
he grabs at his runaway hens.

1076
01:44:07,849 --> 01:44:11,307
Arjan has iron hands
from all that hammering.

1077
01:44:13,054 --> 01:44:13,952
That's right.

1078
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:15,521
As for Isar Kaka's hands...

1079
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:18,124
If money doesn't slip through them,
what's a mere ball!

1080
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:23,497
And we do need a medicine man
in a game of cuts and bruises.

1081
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:28,329
And who doesn't know
our Bagha's strength!

1082
01:44:28,503 --> 01:44:30,403
Tough as teak.

1083
01:44:34,509 --> 01:44:35,669
As for this Guran...

1084
01:44:35,844 --> 01:44:39,007
Passion runs like a fever
through this possessed loony.

1085
01:44:39,181 --> 01:44:41,877
Saturn is strong
and Mars is mighty.

1086
01:44:43,919 --> 01:44:46,979
And Ismayeel...
as I remember...

1087
01:44:47,155 --> 01:44:50,056
We have always been rivals
in Gilli-Danda.

1088
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:51,253
And I?

1089
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:52,757
Oh, yes. Tipu.

1090
01:44:52,928 --> 01:44:54,919
Our Tipu is so bright.

1091
01:44:56,531 --> 01:44:59,659
Now, you tell me, Lakha.
What are you good at?

1092
01:45:00,535 --> 01:45:03,527
I... I can run very fast.

1093
01:45:05,407 --> 01:45:08,205
So... you can run fast.

1094
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:11,504
Okay. Then do one thing.

1095
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,174
Let's see you run fast
up the temple steps three times.

1096
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:18,715
Fast, I said. Can you do it?

1097
01:45:23,959 --> 01:45:26,621
Okay, Lakha.
Now run.

1098
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,389
Don't fall!

1099
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:34,399
Even I can run faster than him!

1100
01:45:37,572 --> 01:45:41,303
Bhuvan, don't you ever take him.
There's malice in his heart.

1101
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:44,038
No, Gauri. We need him.

1102
01:45:45,814 --> 01:45:49,113
All that chopping of wood has
made his hands tough and strong.

1103
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:50,975
He'll hit the ball really hard.

1104
01:45:53,655 --> 01:45:55,384
Come on, run! Yes, run.

1105
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,794
He's at least trying, isn't he.

1106
01:46:00,962 --> 01:46:02,930
Don't worry. I'll give you
ointment for stiff legs!

1107
01:46:02,998 --> 01:46:04,625
Hey, run up the steps!

1108
01:46:07,235 --> 01:46:08,827
The fellow is back.

1109
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:18,474
So you saw, Bhuvan?
What do you say?

1110
01:46:19,981 --> 01:46:21,642
You run a tad slow, pal.

1111
01:46:21,816 --> 01:46:23,340
You have to be faster.

1112
01:46:23,585 --> 01:46:25,985
I'll improve, Bhuvan.
I'll run every day.

1113
01:46:26,288 --> 01:46:28,813
But take me into the team.

1114
01:46:29,157 --> 01:46:33,093
I can't bear the thought of
the village being dishonoured.

1115
01:46:33,862 --> 01:46:36,695
What do you all have to say?
- Give him a chance and see.

1116
01:46:36,865 --> 01:46:38,526
Okay, let's try him out.

1117
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:39,958
Look, Lakha...

1118
01:46:42,537 --> 01:46:46,667
Cheating at games has been
a childhood habit of yours.

1119
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,273
What if you try it here too...

1120
01:46:48,443 --> 01:46:52,539
What are you saying, Ismayeel!
I'm sorry. Truly sorry, I swear.

1121
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:56,816
Okay, Lakha.
You are in our team.

1122
01:46:58,119 --> 01:47:00,849
But remember!
It's a huge responsibility.

1123
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:04,619
For the Whiteys,
it's only a game.

1124
01:47:04,826 --> 01:47:07,624
But for us, it's our life!

1125
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:10,494
Yes, Bhuvan.

1126
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:12,964
I am with you.

1127
01:48:01,116 --> 01:48:04,608
You will play with this ball from now.

1128
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,678
Oh, wow!

1129
01:48:09,057 --> 01:48:13,756
Memsahib, your support has really
lifted our spirits. Thank you.

1130
01:48:15,397 --> 01:48:17,729
Goli will inaugurate this ball.

1131
01:48:17,899 --> 01:48:19,230
Forget the ball now.

1132
01:48:19,901 --> 01:48:21,232
You must all eat first.

1133
01:48:21,403 --> 01:48:23,769
It's to fill our bellies that we
must practise so hard, Gauri.

1134
01:48:23,938 --> 01:48:25,929
We'll play first.
Come on, all of you.

1135
01:48:28,209 --> 01:48:29,540
Come here, Bhura.

1136
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:38,316
Ouch, he really made me run.

1137
01:48:38,553 --> 01:48:40,487
Marvellous!
That was some hit, Bhuvan.

1138
01:48:56,271 --> 01:48:57,738
Hey, give me the ball.

1139
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:18,350
Who is Bhuvan here?

1140
01:49:19,828 --> 01:49:21,022
I am Bhuvan.

1141
01:49:23,465 --> 01:49:24,489
And you are...?

1142
01:49:26,267 --> 01:49:29,259
I am Deva.
Deva Singh Sodhi.

1143
01:49:30,839 --> 01:49:32,864
I've come from Dhaulpur.

1144
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:37,941
I hear you have vowed
to fight the British.

1145
01:49:40,648 --> 01:49:44,140
Yes. But not with sticks and spears.
With bat and ball.

1146
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:48,111
Whether with sticks and spears
or bat and ball...

1147
01:49:48,523 --> 01:49:51,651
...I want to be in every battle
against the British.

1148
01:49:53,661 --> 01:49:56,789
Let me lend a helping hand
in this fight, Bhuvan.

1149
01:49:57,699 --> 01:50:00,293
I have played this game before.

1150
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:02,533
When?

1151
01:50:02,837 --> 01:50:04,828
I was in the British army.

1152
01:50:06,307 --> 01:50:08,468
I couldn't bear it any more
one day.

1153
01:50:09,844 --> 01:50:13,041
I came away after slamming
a final salute to those brutes.

1154
01:50:16,518 --> 01:50:18,986
I hate the British!

1155
01:50:21,723 --> 01:50:23,918
The Memsahib is with us, not against.

1156
01:50:27,061 --> 01:50:29,894
What do you know about the game?

1157
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:33,023
Two things, Memsahib.

1158
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:37,403
When I throw the ball,
shatter all three stumps.

1159
01:50:39,507 --> 01:50:42,840
And when I hit the ball,
smash it to pieces.

1160
01:50:45,146 --> 01:50:46,636
That's good.

1161
01:50:47,248 --> 01:50:51,014
We saw your bowling, Deva.
Now take the bat.

1162
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,054
Goli, throw the ball.

1163
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:58,123
Goli, leave the ball.
No play until you eat.

1164
01:50:59,127 --> 01:51:01,687
Okay. All of you come and eat.

1165
01:51:01,896 --> 01:51:02,954
Come, Deva.

1166
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:05,962
I'm getting late. I must go.

1167
01:51:07,635 --> 01:51:10,103
Bhuvan, I have something to say to you.

1168
01:51:10,471 --> 01:51:11,631
Yes, Memsahib.

1169
01:51:11,706 --> 01:51:13,367
Bye, Gauri.

1170
01:51:22,584 --> 01:51:23,881
Obstacle...!

1171
01:51:26,487 --> 01:51:27,920
Looming obstacle!

1172
01:51:31,993 --> 01:51:37,488
Bhuvan, it's difficult for me
to get out of the Cantonment.

1173
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:41,962
I can't meet you every day now.

1174
01:51:43,638 --> 01:51:48,166
Anyway, you now have
the support of your people.

1175
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:54,648
But that is not because of me
but for your own sake.

1176
01:51:57,252 --> 01:52:01,245
Because you are a good man.

1177
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,619
And also a good friend.

1178
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:15,597
You know, I've had no friends
since I was a child...

1179
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:20,130
...until I met you.

1180
01:52:24,345 --> 01:52:29,373
I don't know
if I should say it or not...

1181
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,380
But...

1182
01:52:36,224 --> 01:52:38,385
Don't say it.

1183
01:52:42,463 --> 01:52:43,953
In fact...

1184
01:52:45,033 --> 01:52:47,263
...I'm falling in love with you.

1185
01:52:48,236 --> 01:52:50,864
Memsahib, I don't understand English.

1186
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:56,571
I'm falling in love with you, Bhuvan.

1187
01:53:18,733 --> 01:53:21,224
Hey, Jigni, where's Gauri?
- She went off.

1188
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:25,029
Where? What are you glaring at me for?

1189
01:53:28,209 --> 01:53:30,336
What the hell have I done now!

1190
01:53:41,289 --> 01:53:42,313
Hey, Gauri.

1191
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:49,261
I've searched all over the village
and you sit here!

1192
01:53:49,931 --> 01:53:51,592
Why did you go off in a huff?

1193
01:53:51,766 --> 01:53:52,960
My wish.

1194
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:56,565
What do you mean, "my wish"!
You could've at least told me.

1195
01:53:57,038 --> 01:53:58,232
How could I?

1196
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,804
As if you can ever spare time
from that White lady!

1197
01:54:01,976 --> 01:54:04,911
The moment she comes,
you flutter around like a silly pigeon.

1198
01:54:05,079 --> 01:54:06,979
You can't see anything else.

1199
01:54:08,316 --> 01:54:12,218
And today, you completely
forgot me as if I wasn't there!

1200
01:54:13,154 --> 01:54:15,088
Try to understand, Gauri.

1201
01:54:15,256 --> 01:54:17,486
Memsahib had something
important to tell me.

1202
01:54:17,725 --> 01:54:20,717
If it was so important,
couldn't she say it right there?

1203
01:54:20,895 --> 01:54:23,557
Where was the need to go off
to be alone?

1204
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:27,223
You think I don't know
which way the Ganges is flowing!

1205
01:54:28,603 --> 01:54:32,630
Ah, poor me!
How I feel the pain...

1206
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:38,107
...of the scorpion's sting!

1207
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,504
You are jealous!

1208
01:54:40,681 --> 01:54:44,583
Me! Why should I be jealous!
It's totally beneath me.

1209
01:54:44,919 --> 01:54:48,286
You are jealous and I know
of whom you are jealous!

1210
01:54:49,624 --> 01:54:52,184
I will never meet you
after this day!

1211
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:54,861
And don't you even try
to talk to me!

1212
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,291
Hey, Gauri!

1213
01:54:59,767 --> 01:55:01,598
There's only one house
in the whole village...

1214
01:55:01,769 --> 01:55:03,498
...with a Neem tree
in the courtyard.

1215
01:55:06,307 --> 01:55:07,934
There's also a big field beside it...

1216
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:13,171
And a pair of oxen,
two cows and three goats too.

1217
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:18,819
And I know whose house that is,
silly girl... it's mine!

1218
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:24,989
Listen to one more thing before you go.
Mai also likes you!

1219
01:55:36,971 --> 01:55:38,836
O my lovely lassie!

1220
01:55:42,343 --> 01:55:46,074
Listen to what I have to say

1221
01:55:47,648 --> 01:55:50,913
It is only you
that I love

1222
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,583
What is my life
without you!

1223
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:01,886
The kajal that darkens
your eyes

1224
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:04,255
It's the cloud of dreams

1225
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:07,195
It's because of you
that my heart is crazy

1226
01:56:07,535 --> 01:56:09,935
O lassie, it's true

1227
01:56:16,577 --> 01:56:18,238
O sweet laddie!

1228
01:56:19,213 --> 01:56:22,614
These words come out
of my heart

1229
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:33,282
It is only you
that I love

1230
01:56:35,296 --> 01:56:39,357
It's only you that I take
for my beloved

1231
01:56:41,135 --> 01:56:44,536
Your assuring hand
stills my fluttering veil

1232
01:56:44,705 --> 01:56:46,639
And there is turmoil
in my heart

1233
01:56:46,807 --> 01:56:49,799
This is the moment
I shall never forget

1234
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:52,274
O my beloved!

1235
01:57:26,113 --> 01:57:28,775
My heart it speaks a thousand words

1236
01:57:28,849 --> 01:57:31,044
I feel eternal bliss

1237
01:57:31,786 --> 01:57:34,277
The roses spout their scarlet mouths

1238
01:57:34,355 --> 01:57:36,789
Like offering a kiss

1
01:57:37,068 --> 01:57:39,900
No drop of rain
No glowing flame

2
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:42,495
Has ever been so pure

3
01:57:42,573 --> 01:57:45,475
If being in love can feel like this

4
01:57:45,544 --> 01:57:48,637
Then I'm in love for sure

5
01:57:53,751 --> 01:57:55,652
What lay in my heart

6
01:57:59,323 --> 01:58:03,487
What lay hidden in my heart
leapt to my lips today

7
01:58:04,596 --> 01:58:07,588
An arrow resting
somewhere in my heart

8
01:58:07,766 --> 01:58:10,894
Has found its bow today

9
01:58:11,435 --> 01:58:14,064
Listen, O my love!
For all our lives to come

10
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:16,833
May we remain
in this abode of love

11
01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:21,172
May our entwined hands
never be parted

12
01:58:21,879 --> 01:58:24,713
I shall walk beside you
in your chosen path

13
01:58:25,717 --> 01:58:27,616
True to your love

14
01:59:29,847 --> 01:59:31,678
Oh, I'm in love

15
01:59:35,452 --> 01:59:37,443
I am in love

16
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:43,483
Yes, I'm in love

17
01:59:51,169 --> 01:59:53,330
Should someone ask

18
01:59:53,805 --> 01:59:58,173
I shall tell them
what's happened to me

19
02:00:02,047 --> 02:00:06,346
My every limb is fragrant
because you touched me

20
02:00:10,188 --> 02:00:12,782
Your fragrant body
your flaming beauty

21
02:00:12,991 --> 02:00:15,459
You are the red rose
my enchanted eyes see

22
02:00:16,126 --> 02:00:20,358
How can this allure
not wake my desire

23
02:00:21,065 --> 02:00:26,230
Your beauty shines bright
in youth's searing light

24
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:32,365
Oh, I'm in love

25
02:01:04,274 --> 02:01:06,936
Yes, I'm in love

26
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:32,892
Despite my warning, you continue
to meet those bloody farmers!

27
02:01:32,971 --> 02:01:33,868
How dare you!

28
02:01:33,938 --> 02:01:37,338
I'm not going to tolerate
your nonsense any more.

29
02:01:37,408 --> 02:01:39,809
You can damn well do what you like
in London but not here.

30
02:01:39,911 --> 02:01:41,935
You will pack and leave
for England by the next ship.

31
02:01:42,012 --> 02:01:43,640
Is that clear?

32
02:01:43,714 --> 02:01:46,411
Let me make some things
clear to you, Andrew.

33
02:01:46,483 --> 02:01:49,577
Stop telling me what to do.
I'm not a child.

34
02:01:49,653 --> 02:01:52,053
I'm not leaving Champaner
and get this straight.

35
02:01:52,123 --> 02:01:54,556
I'll go to the village
as and when I so wish.

36
02:01:59,596 --> 02:02:01,588
Tell me, Eliza.

37
02:02:02,032 --> 02:02:06,197
What's so special about them that
you go against your own brother?

38
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:10,339
There's nothing special about them.

39
02:02:10,407 --> 02:02:12,842
You're being unfair
with your silly challenge.

40
02:02:12,911 --> 02:02:15,209
That's why I decided to help them.

41
02:02:15,814 --> 02:02:17,805
And you mark my words.

42
02:02:17,882 --> 02:02:20,248
They'll give you a tough fight.

43
02:02:30,495 --> 02:02:33,827
That's it, Yardley, line and length.
Line and length.

44
02:02:36,801 --> 02:02:38,325
Good.

45
02:02:38,403 --> 02:02:39,596
How's that?

46
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,466
One short, Burton.
Full play.

47
02:02:59,089 --> 02:03:00,580
How was that?

48
02:03:02,392 --> 02:03:03,883
That is out, sir.

49
02:03:03,962 --> 02:03:05,952
That's the end of
the day's play, gentlemen.

50
02:03:06,998 --> 02:03:09,158
I'm going to announce
the batting order now.

51
02:03:10,134 --> 02:03:12,262
Smith and Burton will open...

52
02:03:12,669 --> 02:03:14,637
...with Smith to face...

53
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,333
...followed by myself at number three.

54
02:03:18,108 --> 02:03:21,636
Followed by Brooks, Wesson...

55
02:03:22,779 --> 02:03:26,112
...North, Benson...
- Sir.

56
02:03:27,318 --> 02:03:30,718
...Harrison, Flynn...

57
02:03:31,523 --> 02:03:34,616
...Willis, Yardley.

58
02:03:34,692 --> 02:03:35,954
Right.

59
02:03:38,196 --> 02:03:41,995
Who's to be in the team?
- I think it should be Madhav.

60
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:47,501
What's going on?
Everyone wants to see you play.

61
02:03:48,705 --> 02:03:50,298
We haven't found
our eleventh player.

62
02:03:50,475 --> 02:03:53,842
We'll fix it right away.
Take Bhima.

63
02:03:54,178 --> 02:03:56,204
Hey, Bhima!
- No, Chief.

64
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,610
He's named after the mighty hero
but has backache all the time.

65
02:04:00,785 --> 02:04:03,275
Then how about Kashi Nath?
- Kashi Nath!

66
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:07,488
If the old crock runs he'll split!
Kashi this side and Nath that side.

67
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:10,217
What's to be done then?

68
02:04:10,395 --> 02:04:13,158
We want a big hefty man, Chief.
Let's wait and see.

69
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:16,822
Deva, you throw the ball.
Isar Kaka, you take the bat.

70
02:04:17,467 --> 02:04:19,197
All of you spread out.

71
02:04:24,975 --> 02:04:27,705
Deva, bowl slow to Isar Kaka.
- All right.

72
02:04:52,237 --> 02:04:54,330
Hey, Kachra, throw the ball.

73
02:04:57,608 --> 02:04:59,600
Stop gaping and throw it,
will you?

74
02:05:11,021 --> 02:05:12,512
Hey! What did you do?

75
02:05:13,391 --> 02:05:15,790
I didn't do anything.
You told me to throw it.

76
02:05:17,028 --> 02:05:18,016
Come here.

77
02:05:20,765 --> 02:05:21,891
Come here, I said.

78
02:05:22,967 --> 02:05:25,765
I didn't do anything.
You said throw and I threw the ball.

79
02:05:26,137 --> 02:05:27,729
Come here, all of you.

80
02:05:28,273 --> 02:05:31,902
Eliza Memsahib, just watch Kachra.

81
02:05:32,209 --> 02:05:33,972
Hey, Kachra, throw it again.

82
02:05:34,946 --> 02:05:38,210
I did no wrong. Bhuvan Bhaiyya
asked me to throw and I did.

83
02:05:38,415 --> 02:05:39,609
Come on. Throw the ball.

84
02:05:40,984 --> 02:05:43,317
Stop. Not with the left hand.
Throw with the right.

85
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,985
See how it spins!

86
02:05:54,032 --> 02:05:57,831
Amazing.
He's actually spinning the ball.

87
02:05:58,435 --> 02:06:00,927
We have found our eleventh player!
Come, Kachra.

88
02:06:01,939 --> 02:06:04,999
Isar Kaka, you'll face him.
Goli, give Kachra the ball.

89
02:06:05,176 --> 02:06:07,666
Lakha, go back.
Come on, throw the ball.

90
02:06:11,581 --> 02:06:14,846
What's the matter?
Why's everyone standing and staring?

91
02:06:18,588 --> 02:06:20,613
No, no!
We will not play!

92
02:06:22,092 --> 02:06:23,855
What's happened?

93
02:06:25,129 --> 02:06:30,532
This damn Untouchable!
He can't play with us. No way!

94
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:37,273
That's right. We'll not mix
with an Untouchable.

95
02:06:37,508 --> 02:06:38,838
It's unthinkable!

96
02:06:41,846 --> 02:06:44,781
I am not playing.
- We too won't play.

97
02:06:47,652 --> 02:06:51,553
What are you doing?
It's absolutely wrong!

98
02:06:51,822 --> 02:06:54,985
You are polluting
the whole system.

99
02:06:56,394 --> 02:06:59,454
To fight the English is our duty
but mixing a low-caste...

100
02:06:59,629 --> 02:07:01,325
...is like poisoning milk.
I will not allow this!

101
02:07:01,499 --> 02:07:02,693
Kachra, you scum!

102
02:07:03,201 --> 02:07:04,225
Get lost.

103
02:07:10,341 --> 02:07:12,536
Oh, my God!
Bhuvan touched an Untouchable!

104
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:24,313
You brand people untouchable
and pollute humanity itself.

105
02:07:26,657 --> 02:07:29,023
Chief, why are you choking
the very air of our village...

106
02:07:29,193 --> 02:07:30,660
...with this caste division!

107
02:07:30,827 --> 02:07:33,524
Is it right to destroy and shatter
hearts in the name of skin colour?

108
02:07:35,899 --> 02:07:40,097
Then why worship Ram who ate
a tribal woman's half-eaten berries?

109
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:42,737
The Lord who ferries us all
across this sea of life...

110
02:07:42,907 --> 02:07:45,033
...was himself ferried by
a low-caste boatman.

111
02:07:45,209 --> 02:07:48,371
You know all this and yet
talk of untouchability!

112
02:07:48,545 --> 02:07:51,447
And you, Isar Kaka!
You are a man of medicine.

113
02:07:51,749 --> 02:07:55,048
You check the ailing patient's pulse
and treat him.

114
02:07:56,254 --> 02:07:59,222
Do your scriptures tell you
not to treat an untouchable?

115
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:00,721
And let him die?

116
02:08:02,527 --> 02:08:07,692
If that's so, it'll be the darkest blot
on humanity. After this...

117
02:08:07,865 --> 02:08:11,733
...no one will regard a man of
medicine as God's other form!

118
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:16,634
Leave all that, Bhuvan.
You want a big hefty player, don't you?

119
02:08:16,974 --> 02:08:18,373
This Kachra is a cripple!

120
02:08:19,777 --> 02:08:21,608
Your hands aren't deformed, right?

121
02:08:21,778 --> 02:08:24,440
It's by God's grace, Lakha,
that you can say all this.

122
02:08:24,615 --> 02:08:29,608
But the man you call crippled will be
our greatest strength. Wait and see.

123
02:08:29,821 --> 02:08:32,653
This seemingly lifeless hand
will give us victory.

124
02:08:33,423 --> 02:08:36,153
Let me remind all of you
of one thing.

125
02:08:36,827 --> 02:08:41,390
This is not a game we are
playing for fun or entertainment.

126
02:08:42,099 --> 02:08:44,225
This is a battle we must win!

127
02:08:45,169 --> 02:08:49,229
Our only goal is liberation from Lagaan
and welfare of our village.

128
02:08:49,573 --> 02:08:52,600
And for that, I will not bow
before anyone till my last breath!

129
02:08:52,777 --> 02:08:55,802
Whether you support me or not,
Kachra will play.

130
02:09:11,428 --> 02:09:12,759
Bhuvan, my son...

131
02:09:13,865 --> 02:09:18,700
Shame can't even enter eyes
that are fully opened.

132
02:09:21,037 --> 02:09:25,600
I agree with Isar Bhai.
What you said was right, Bhuvan.

133
02:09:33,984 --> 02:09:35,680
Kachra will play with us.

134
02:11:55,793 --> 02:11:59,125
Again and again, yes
Say this, my friend

135
02:12:00,363 --> 02:12:04,027
May victory be ours!
Defeat, their lot

136
02:12:05,536 --> 02:12:09,165
Again and again, yes
Say this, my friend

137
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:13,871
May victory be ours!
Defeat, their lot

138
02:12:15,512 --> 02:12:17,844
Let no one win
against us

139
02:12:18,282 --> 02:12:20,341
Let's walk ahead
Let's walk ahead

140
02:12:20,517 --> 02:12:22,815
All challengers
will bite the dust

141
02:12:23,053 --> 02:12:24,884
Let's walk ahead

142
02:12:25,623 --> 02:12:27,716
Even if it is pitch-dark

143
02:12:28,125 --> 02:12:30,149
Let's walk ahead
Let's walk ahead

144
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,988
Let no one stay back
on the road

145
02:12:33,197 --> 02:12:34,391
Let's walk ahead

146
02:12:35,733 --> 02:12:39,225
If a finger rises
break it shall

147
02:12:40,805 --> 02:12:44,331
When all five join
the fist is formed!

148
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:50,178
Let our unity grow
Come on, walk ahead

149
02:12:50,714 --> 02:12:53,479
However seductive
the lures cast before you

150
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:55,482
Walk ahead

151
02:12:55,919 --> 02:12:58,149
No one can ever win
against us

152
02:12:58,422 --> 02:13:00,548
Let's walk ahead
Let's walk ahead

153
02:13:00,725 --> 02:13:03,387
All challengers
will bite the dust

154
02:13:03,593 --> 02:13:04,719
So walk ahead

155
02:13:42,366 --> 02:13:45,301
Let no one stop you
obstruct you

156
02:13:45,602 --> 02:13:47,298
Break all barriers

157
02:13:48,371 --> 02:13:52,240
What have you ever got
being weak and powerless

158
02:13:53,576 --> 02:13:55,476
Never will we suffer again

159
02:13:55,645 --> 02:13:58,774
Such will be our play
the enemy will lose

160
02:13:59,883 --> 02:14:03,615
We will now take
the path of courage

161
02:14:04,889 --> 02:14:06,947
We will shake up this earth

162
02:14:07,258 --> 02:14:08,987
We will show everyone

163
02:14:09,592 --> 02:14:11,924
Who is king
who the slave

164
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:18,891
We shall show this
overwhelmed world

165
02:14:19,602 --> 02:14:21,434
What we are worth

166
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:28,274
Again and again, yes
Say this, my friend

167
02:14:29,612 --> 02:14:33,275
Victory will be ours
Defeat, their lot

168
02:14:34,451 --> 02:14:37,079
Now
No fear will enter our hearts

169
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:39,354
Let's walk ahead
Let's walk ahead

170
02:14:39,757 --> 02:14:42,350
Every shackle
will now break open

171
02:14:42,525 --> 02:14:43,959
Let's walk ahead

172
02:15:41,318 --> 02:15:44,253
Keep walking
Don't ever falter

173
02:15:44,754 --> 02:15:46,814
You are the journeyman
of the road

174
02:15:47,323 --> 02:15:51,020
The snake of tiredness
should never bite you

175
02:15:52,495 --> 02:15:55,397
He that rules you
is a tyrant

176
02:15:55,565 --> 02:15:57,591
He that has destroyed us

177
02:15:58,669 --> 02:16:00,693
His home is in the west

178
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:02,930
We shall make sure
he will not remain

179
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:05,841
We will shake up this earth

180
02:16:06,176 --> 02:16:08,166
We will show everyone

181
02:16:08,444 --> 02:16:10,742
Who is king
who the slave

182
02:16:13,684 --> 02:16:17,585
We shall show this
overwhelmed world

183
02:16:18,621 --> 02:16:21,386
What we are worth

184
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:25,759
What has to happen
will happen

185
02:16:26,030 --> 02:16:27,963
Let's walk ahead
Let's walk ahead

186
02:16:28,298 --> 02:16:30,733
Now
No one will bow his head

187
02:16:30,967 --> 02:16:32,697
Let's walk ahead

188
02:17:56,519 --> 02:18:01,150
And then, the historic day dawned
when the first rays of the sun...

189
02:18:02,059 --> 02:18:04,185
...fell on the cricket field.

190
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:02,509
Good morning, Captain Russell.
- Good morning, Colonel Boyer.

191
02:19:02,586 --> 02:19:05,019
This way.
- Thank you.

192
02:19:12,362 --> 02:19:15,057
Morning, Miss Russell.
- Miss Russell.

193
02:19:17,267 --> 02:19:20,532
Are you feeling confident, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

194
02:19:21,405 --> 02:19:23,269
Decent crowd.

195
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:54,160
Hail Hanuman,
The Mighty Ape God!

196
02:20:25,368 --> 02:20:27,302
Long live Your Highness.

197
02:20:29,006 --> 02:20:33,636
Smash the Feringhees.
Beat them to pulp.

198
02:20:36,112 --> 02:20:38,945
Crush Captain Russell's arrogance.

199
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:42,049
Long live...
- Your Highness.

200
02:20:47,291 --> 02:20:50,123
Things are certainly beginning
to hot up a bit, aren't they?

201
02:20:50,193 --> 02:20:51,182
Yes.

202
02:20:51,661 --> 02:20:54,790
Both the teams will bat once.

203
02:20:55,399 --> 02:20:57,889
The game will be played
over three days.

204
02:20:58,201 --> 02:21:00,692
Which team bats first...

205
02:21:02,205 --> 02:21:05,232
...will be decided by
the toss of a coin.

206
02:21:06,043 --> 02:21:10,139
For this, both the teams
must enter the field.

207
02:21:40,344 --> 02:21:42,743
To ensure fair play...

208
02:21:43,112 --> 02:21:47,208
...senior officials had invited
neutral umpires from Kanpur.

209
02:21:49,253 --> 02:21:51,187
Will you call, Captain Russell?

210
02:21:51,254 --> 02:21:52,415
Heads, sir.

211
02:21:57,794 --> 02:22:00,057
Heads. Your call.

212
02:22:00,129 --> 02:22:01,528
We will bat.

213
02:22:02,498 --> 02:22:05,126
Good luck, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

214
02:22:07,403 --> 02:22:09,235
Good luck, young man.

215
02:22:22,285 --> 02:22:27,450
The batting team that scores
more runs wins the game.

216
02:22:28,625 --> 02:22:32,618
Opening the batting for
the English team...

217
02:22:33,230 --> 02:22:35,629
...are Lt. Smith
and Lt. Burton.

218
02:23:18,575 --> 02:23:20,269
What are they doing?

219
02:23:39,463 --> 02:23:40,724
Come here.

220
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,030
What are you all doing?

221
02:23:45,301 --> 02:23:46,996
All running at
the same time!

222
02:23:47,971 --> 02:23:51,498
You run and grab the ball
only if it comes to you. Got it?

223
02:23:53,543 --> 02:23:54,634
Now go.

224
02:24:02,753 --> 02:24:04,083
Well done, Bhura!

225
02:24:19,836 --> 02:24:25,274
The ball crosses the boundary
and the English get four more runs.

226
02:24:30,814 --> 02:24:32,246
No ball.

227
02:24:40,657 --> 02:24:41,817
No ball.

228
02:24:43,794 --> 02:24:46,091
Steady, Smith, steady.

229
02:24:46,429 --> 02:24:49,262
Deva crossed the line
before he bowled the ball.

230
02:24:49,432 --> 02:24:52,527
So the English batsman has not
been given out.

231
02:24:52,701 --> 02:24:54,567
Instead, he got an extra run.

232
02:24:58,307 --> 02:25:00,299
Damn! He made me run!

233
02:25:06,516 --> 02:25:08,278
Bat's over.

234
02:25:08,818 --> 02:25:12,413
With this ball,
Deva's over is finished.

235
02:25:12,756 --> 02:25:14,621
And eight runs were made.

236
02:25:15,158 --> 02:25:18,126
Now, a new bowler
will bowl the ball.

237
02:25:23,633 --> 02:25:26,100
The ball will spin.
Grab the catch.

238
02:25:26,269 --> 02:25:27,133
Okay.

239
02:25:39,815 --> 02:25:40,839
Spin it!

240
02:25:46,556 --> 02:25:47,716
Good shot, Burton.

241
02:26:14,684 --> 02:26:17,881
Why isn't the ball spinning!
- Don't know.

242
02:26:36,139 --> 02:26:37,469
Catch it, Lakha!

243
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:03,863
Kachra isn't spinning the ball
at all today.

244
02:27:04,099 --> 02:27:05,692
He has to be taken off.

245
02:27:06,435 --> 02:27:09,166
Deva, you better get
your breath back.

246
02:27:10,339 --> 02:27:13,001
Bhuvan, you bowl.
- Okay.

247
02:27:27,557 --> 02:27:28,955
Aim and hit!

248
02:27:36,099 --> 02:27:38,397
The first English batsman is out!

249
02:27:53,016 --> 02:27:54,846
Rather looking forward to this.

250
02:27:55,517 --> 02:27:57,713
Well done, Smith.
- Yes, sir.

251
02:27:58,153 --> 02:28:00,144
Coming to bat now...

252
02:28:00,456 --> 02:28:03,392
...is the English captain,
Captain Russell.

253
02:28:38,427 --> 02:28:41,089
Sharp fielding there.

254
02:28:42,198 --> 02:28:43,187
Well done.

255
02:28:43,299 --> 02:28:45,823
For the loss of one wicket...

256
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:47,628
...they have scored 66 runs so far.

257
02:28:48,304 --> 02:28:50,897
Shatter the sticks, Goli.
- Of course.

258
02:28:52,208 --> 02:28:54,971
Will throw with the right arm
and from this side.

259
02:28:55,044 --> 02:28:57,240
Right arm, over the wicket.

260
02:29:09,892 --> 02:29:11,325
Very good, Goli.

261
02:29:13,629 --> 02:29:17,224
Sir, did you see that?
- Yes, I did.

262
02:29:17,299 --> 02:29:18,426
That's excellent, Goli!

263
02:29:28,144 --> 02:29:29,634
This is ridiculous.

264
02:29:30,512 --> 02:29:34,107
Sir, he may not be allowed to bowl
the ball like this. It's improper.

265
02:29:34,184 --> 02:29:35,514
What's the matter?

266
02:29:35,685 --> 02:29:38,415
He can't bowl like this.
- Why not?

267
02:29:43,692 --> 02:29:45,216
What's wrong, Sahib?

268
02:29:48,932 --> 02:29:51,264
Have you ever seen
such an action, sir?

269
02:29:51,333 --> 02:29:53,564
Excuse me, sir.
Is something the matter?

270
02:29:53,636 --> 02:29:55,365
You see we have a problem here.

271
02:29:55,437 --> 02:29:58,429
This man swings his arm more than once
before releasing the ball.

272
02:29:58,508 --> 02:30:00,498
He'll have to bowl conventionally.

273
02:30:01,410 --> 02:30:04,437
Sir, I think you're being unfair
to the home team.

274
02:30:04,514 --> 02:30:07,004
Unfair! How can you say that?

275
02:30:07,083 --> 02:30:09,517
It's only fair they ask this man
to bowl properly.

276
02:30:09,919 --> 02:30:14,618
There is no rule written anywhere
about such an action, is there?

277
02:30:15,024 --> 02:30:17,788
Well, there's nothing written
about it that I can recall.

278
02:30:20,730 --> 02:30:23,254
There's nothing written
about this rule.

279
02:30:23,333 --> 02:30:25,857
Well, we better write
some rules, Captain...

280
02:30:25,935 --> 02:30:29,097
...which, unfortunately,
can happen only after this match.

281
02:30:29,171 --> 02:30:31,766
Till then, let's get on with the match.

282
02:30:31,841 --> 02:30:33,604
Okay. He can bowl.

283
02:30:39,115 --> 02:30:42,778
To kill a tiger or cheetah!
Bah! That's nothing!

284
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:44,578
Defeat the tyrants.

285
02:30:44,753 --> 02:30:46,846
Thrash the Feringhees!
Beat them! Defeat them!

286
02:30:47,022 --> 02:30:49,490
Come on! Throw the ball,
break the stick!

287
02:30:59,301 --> 02:31:00,666
For goodness' sake.

288
02:31:17,753 --> 02:31:20,916
Brooks, look out for his arm action.
It's damn ridiculous.

289
02:31:21,224 --> 02:31:23,214
Dangerous too.

290
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:29,855
The next batsman is Lt. Brooks.

291
02:31:33,969 --> 02:31:35,459
Two, please.

292
02:31:37,105 --> 02:31:38,266
Thank you.

293
02:31:51,286 --> 02:31:53,687
Brooks.
- Sir.

294
02:31:57,227 --> 02:32:01,163
Just before he releases the ball,
he makes a grunting noise.

295
02:32:01,564 --> 02:32:02,894
Something like this.

296
02:32:04,766 --> 02:32:07,360
Listen for it.
- Right, sir. Thank you.

297
02:32:28,690 --> 02:32:30,522
Good timing.

298
02:32:40,435 --> 02:32:41,903
Losing two wickets...

299
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:44,129
...they have made 132 runs.

300
02:32:44,641 --> 02:32:48,543
Capt Russell is on 38
and Lt. Brooks on 32.

301
02:32:53,216 --> 02:32:54,375
Catch it, Bagha!

302
02:33:29,985 --> 02:33:33,945
I don't think W. G. Grace could have
made such confident strokes.

303
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:35,081
This could be.

304
02:33:43,799 --> 02:33:46,166
What are you doing, Lakha!

305
02:33:46,501 --> 02:33:47,798
I missed it, Kaka.

306
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:53,102
How could you miss, son!
Where's your concentration?

307
02:33:53,375 --> 02:33:55,639
We have to win.
We must win this game.

308
02:33:56,044 --> 02:33:57,443
Please concentrate.

309
02:33:57,612 --> 02:33:59,102
Go on, Bhuvan. Bowl.

310
02:34:18,301 --> 02:34:20,929
The end of the day's play, gentlemen.

311
02:34:22,572 --> 02:34:25,062
The English team has scored...

312
02:34:25,407 --> 02:34:28,001
...182 runs for 2 wickets.

313
02:34:28,477 --> 02:34:32,004
And with this, we come to
the end of the first day's play.

314
02:34:33,416 --> 02:34:35,679
Our game wasn't good today.

315
02:34:36,886 --> 02:34:39,514
What were you up to, Lakha?

316
02:34:39,921 --> 02:34:42,083
You played so well during practice.

317
02:34:42,258 --> 02:34:45,716
Practice was different.
We were playing among ourselves.

318
02:34:46,528 --> 02:34:49,019
But why're you blaming only me?

319
02:34:49,365 --> 02:34:53,926
You all went gaga over Kachra.
Saw the cripple's miracle today?

320
02:34:54,169 --> 02:34:55,330
I told you before...

321
02:34:55,504 --> 02:34:59,065
At least he tried.
You weren't even trying!

322
02:34:59,241 --> 02:35:02,506
What did he do with all that trying?
- Shut up, Lakha.

323
02:35:23,432 --> 02:35:26,959
That night, Elizabeth's eye
fell on a shadowy figure.

324
02:35:29,572 --> 02:35:31,437
She tried to investigate.

325
02:35:32,407 --> 02:35:34,399
My being in the team was
of some help at least.

326
02:35:34,576 --> 02:35:37,272
She was amazed to see Lakha there.

327
02:35:46,155 --> 02:35:50,955
She went to the village at once
and informed Bhuvan about Lakha.

328
02:35:59,935 --> 02:36:01,426
I... I...

329
02:36:03,806 --> 02:36:05,637
...did wrong.

330
02:36:08,778 --> 02:36:10,575
What I did was very wrong.

331
02:36:14,282 --> 02:36:15,580
Forgive me.

332
02:36:16,352 --> 02:36:19,753
Lakha, a snake like you
must be crushed!

333
02:36:50,386 --> 02:36:51,410
Stop!

334
02:36:57,326 --> 02:36:58,918
I'm telling you again, stop.

335
02:36:59,094 --> 02:37:01,722
Drag him out, Bhuvan.
- We'll kill him!

336
02:37:06,435 --> 02:37:08,493
Calm down.
All of you calm down.

337
02:37:08,671 --> 02:37:10,160
I'll talk to him.

338
02:37:11,407 --> 02:37:13,875
Lakha, open the door!

339
02:37:14,844 --> 02:37:18,939
No, Bhuvan. I won't open
the door. They will kill me!

340
02:37:19,615 --> 02:37:20,673
I won't open it.

341
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:22,775
Nobody will do anything, Lakha.

342
02:37:23,386 --> 02:37:27,014
How long will you stay inside?
They'll not budge from here.

343
02:37:27,189 --> 02:37:29,214
Open the door and let me in.

344
02:37:39,134 --> 02:37:42,400
I made a mistake, Bhuvan.
Forgive me.

345
02:37:50,812 --> 02:37:52,541
Why did you do it, Lakha?

346
02:37:56,419 --> 02:37:58,649
I lost my mind, Bhuvan.

347
02:38:02,157 --> 02:38:04,820
Because...

348
02:38:06,828 --> 02:38:08,990
...I was in love with Gauri.

349
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:14,266
I wanted to have her at any cost.

350
02:38:16,471 --> 02:38:21,238
But she loves you.
And I hated you for that.

351
02:38:22,078 --> 02:38:23,772
I hated you for that!

352
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:26,171
I wanted you to lose.

353
02:38:26,514 --> 02:38:28,483
I wanted to disgrace you in
Gauri's eyes...

354
02:38:28,650 --> 02:38:31,084
...and the whole village as well.

355
02:38:33,756 --> 02:38:36,623
For that, you risked the life
of the whole village.

356
02:38:37,692 --> 02:38:39,820
You staked their future?

357
02:38:41,596 --> 02:38:43,826
Do you know what you have
done, Lakha?

358
02:38:45,134 --> 02:38:47,466
Save me, Bhuvan!
Save me!

359
02:38:50,939 --> 02:38:54,774
Give me a chance to repent.
Just one chance!

360
02:38:55,011 --> 02:38:57,342
I swear on my mother!
I'll do whatever you say.

361
02:38:57,713 --> 02:39:01,705
But give me just one chance
to repent.

362
02:39:03,285 --> 02:39:05,480
I can give you one chance.

363
02:39:07,522 --> 02:39:09,786
But you must prove your loyalty.

364
02:39:11,126 --> 02:39:15,496
If you can't, you will not
find refuge even here!

365
02:39:29,544 --> 02:39:34,504
They begin the second day's play
with the score at 182.

366
02:39:35,051 --> 02:39:39,817
Hail the Great Guru's warriors!
Hail the Great Guru's victory!

367
02:39:56,072 --> 02:39:58,506
You gladden our hearts!
Live long!

368
02:40:20,062 --> 02:40:22,222
The next batsman is Lt. Wesson.

369
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,865
Nice shot!

370
02:41:06,241 --> 02:41:08,903
Rather enjoyable knock.
- Lovely to watch.

371
02:41:19,955 --> 02:41:24,823
Oh, great shot, sir. Well played.
Let's have some more of those.

372
02:41:24,894 --> 02:41:26,884
Congratulations, Wesson.

373
02:41:27,195 --> 02:41:29,493
And that's lunch, gentlemen.

374
02:41:34,302 --> 02:41:37,533
271 to 3 is
an extremely good score, Captain.

375
02:41:37,605 --> 02:41:40,267
Yes, I think we'll be looking at
at least 600.

376
02:41:40,576 --> 02:41:42,770
Something to please the crowd.

377
02:41:43,512 --> 02:41:45,342
Steady.

378
02:41:54,189 --> 02:41:59,889
Bhuvan, if they continue
to bat like this...

379
02:42:04,666 --> 02:42:07,134
You'll have to do something.

380
02:42:08,203 --> 02:42:09,727
Yes, Memsahib.

381
02:42:11,506 --> 02:42:14,304
All the bowlers have tried.

382
02:42:17,378 --> 02:42:19,312
I don't know what to do.

383
02:42:48,310 --> 02:42:49,833
Over.

384
02:43:00,189 --> 02:43:01,746
Oh! You are doing it.

385
02:43:04,192 --> 02:43:05,921
Come here. Come on.

386
02:43:09,564 --> 02:43:12,533
What's this!
He's given him the ball again!

387
02:43:12,735 --> 02:43:14,362
I can't understand.

388
02:43:14,637 --> 02:43:15,762
Crazy chap!

389
02:43:41,629 --> 02:43:44,360
Goodness gracious,
the ball turned almost three feet.

390
02:44:02,116 --> 02:44:03,243
Catch it, Bhura!

391
02:44:27,309 --> 02:44:30,278
Gentlemen, he's on a hat trick.

392
02:44:49,631 --> 02:44:51,463
He's done it, by George.

393
02:45:11,352 --> 02:45:14,685
From 295 for 3,
they are now 295 for 6!

394
02:45:16,157 --> 02:45:20,423
Hail Almighty Ape!
Crack the enemy's back!

395
02:45:44,318 --> 02:45:46,150
Good shot, Harrison. Good shot.

396
02:45:50,192 --> 02:45:55,424
Oh! So you step out and hit, do you!
Try coming out now!

397
02:46:03,905 --> 02:46:07,899
Go back! Go back home!
With your tail between your legs!

398
02:46:08,876 --> 02:46:12,312
You Tea drinkers!
Fleabags! Boot wearers!

399
02:46:29,897 --> 02:46:31,421
Grab it, Bagha!

400
02:46:34,469 --> 02:46:36,062
Catch, Bagha! Catch!

401
02:46:36,137 --> 02:46:37,126
Catch it, Bagha.

402
02:46:51,153 --> 02:46:52,780
You caught it!

403
02:47:17,278 --> 02:47:20,874
The score is 320 and
only 2 batsmen left!

404
02:47:33,461 --> 02:47:35,326
Arjan, don't drop it!

405
02:47:39,400 --> 02:47:40,799
Caught it!

406
02:48:39,727 --> 02:48:41,889
With the last batsman out...

407
02:48:42,064 --> 02:48:44,224
...the English innings is over.

408
02:48:46,634 --> 02:48:52,403
The Champaner team will have
to make 323 runs to win.

409
02:48:53,008 --> 02:48:55,499
They collapsed like a house of cards.

410
02:48:55,576 --> 02:48:57,942
That leaves them
a huge mountain to climb.

411
02:48:58,012 --> 02:48:59,673
Absolutely, Major Cotton.

412
02:49:00,115 --> 02:49:01,810
Come on, brothers!

413
02:49:02,416 --> 02:49:03,940
Get rid of Lagaan!

414
02:49:04,419 --> 02:49:07,046
Come on, brothers!
- Get rid of Lagaan!

415
02:49:08,123 --> 02:49:10,387
Come on, brothers!
- Get rid of Lagaan!

416
02:49:12,794 --> 02:49:15,421
That was simply great!

417
02:49:16,597 --> 02:49:19,964
Kachra's magic worked.
The Whiteys just crumbled.

418
02:49:20,402 --> 02:49:24,804
I felt Bhuvan was making
a big mistake giving you the ball.

419
02:49:25,107 --> 02:49:26,096
But he bowled well.

420
02:49:26,275 --> 02:49:26,969
Brilliantly.

421
02:49:27,141 --> 02:49:29,006
The foolish Feringhees
only looked in front.

422
02:49:29,176 --> 02:49:33,772
And the ball whizzed past
their butts and knocked the bails off!

423
02:49:34,516 --> 02:49:35,983
All this joking is fine.

424
02:49:36,919 --> 02:49:41,253
But you have to think of how
you will make these 323 runs.

425
02:49:41,490 --> 02:49:42,923
It'll be done, Chief.

426
02:49:43,658 --> 02:49:45,182
Listen, all of you.

427
02:49:45,993 --> 02:49:49,794
Ismayeel, Lakha, Bagha,
Deva and Arjan...

428
02:49:50,798 --> 02:49:54,256
We six together are responsible
for getting these 323 runs.

429
02:49:54,602 --> 02:49:57,298
The others are weak in batting.

430
02:49:57,705 --> 02:50:01,937
And so, all six of us must bat
cautiously and calmly.

431
02:50:03,144 --> 02:50:06,774
Deva, you and I will open
the batting.

432
02:50:07,983 --> 02:50:11,884
And we should both stay put
firmly till end of play today.

433
02:50:12,054 --> 02:50:13,282
Okay, brother.

434
02:51:14,583 --> 02:51:16,448
Careful, Bhuvan!

435
02:51:17,084 --> 02:51:19,246
Steady, Bhuvan, steady.

436
02:51:20,088 --> 02:51:23,546
What're you doing, Bhuvan!
Get a hold of yourself.

437
02:52:25,352 --> 02:52:28,480
The people of the village get
four more runs with this.

438
02:52:42,336 --> 02:52:45,567
All right, Ram Singh.
All right.

439
02:52:53,948 --> 02:52:58,147
Come on, brothers!
- Get rid of Lagaan!

440
02:53:09,998 --> 02:53:11,589
Yardley!

441
02:53:25,580 --> 02:53:26,740
Well done, Smith!

442
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:31,150
Oh, how could this happen!

443
02:53:31,887 --> 02:53:33,945
Don't forget the crease.

444
02:53:35,689 --> 02:53:37,589
Yes, very bad luck.

445
02:53:49,036 --> 02:53:51,096
Who is next? Oh, it's Arjan.

446
02:53:52,841 --> 02:53:56,402
Just forget how that arrogant
White humiliated you.

447
02:53:56,610 --> 02:53:58,544
Just stay there till the evening.

448
02:53:58,612 --> 02:53:59,602
Be careful.

449
02:54:17,232 --> 02:54:18,961
Well done!

450
02:54:33,314 --> 02:54:35,407
Be careful, Arjan.

451
02:54:44,391 --> 02:54:50,227
You won't have a morsel to eat.
Nor a piece of cloth to wear.

452
02:54:51,666 --> 02:54:55,500
They are trying to needle you, Arjan.
Stay calm.

453
02:54:56,971 --> 02:54:59,166
Get that darkie, Smith.

454
02:54:59,641 --> 02:55:03,133
You won't have a morsel to eat.
Nor a piece of cloth to wear.

455
02:55:18,592 --> 02:55:22,495
We will take double
and triple Lagaan from you!

456
02:55:22,964 --> 02:55:25,932
They are trying to provoke you, Arjan.
Stay calm.

457
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:30,596
You damn slaves will remain
crushed under our boots!

458
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:33,304
Careful, Arjan. Stay calm!

459
02:55:40,682 --> 02:55:42,980
Catch it, North, catch it!

460
02:55:45,219 --> 02:55:46,743
Yes!

461
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:48,652
Well done.
That's the way.

462
02:56:00,368 --> 02:56:02,358
Well bowled, Smith.

463
02:56:26,461 --> 02:56:27,951
Yardley...

464
02:56:29,330 --> 02:56:31,491
knock his bloody head off.

465
02:56:50,951 --> 02:56:52,612
Yardley.

466
02:57:05,099 --> 02:57:07,294
Nice bit of sport, Yardley.

467
02:57:07,368 --> 02:57:08,961
That was a nasty one.

468
02:58:16,070 --> 02:58:19,198
My God, he's got some strength
in those arms.

469
02:58:20,041 --> 02:58:21,974
Bagha, please be careful!

470
02:58:22,477 --> 02:58:24,137
Don't get carried away.

471
02:58:31,285 --> 02:58:33,277
Oh, well bowled.

472
02:58:52,339 --> 02:58:53,328
Go, my son.

473
02:59:00,682 --> 02:59:02,376
Come again, Yardley.

474
02:59:08,323 --> 02:59:09,915
Oh, God.

475
02:59:11,059 --> 02:59:12,355
What happened!

476
02:59:14,229 --> 02:59:15,217
Hurry!

477
02:59:15,296 --> 02:59:17,594
That must have hurt.

478
02:59:20,201 --> 02:59:22,532
Take him away... easy.

479
02:59:23,171 --> 02:59:24,262
Careful.

480
02:59:30,878 --> 02:59:32,368
Are you badly hurt?
- Yes.

481
02:59:46,126 --> 02:59:48,288
How's that?

482
02:59:53,301 --> 02:59:54,562
Thank God...

483
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:57,366
That was close.

484
02:59:57,437 --> 02:59:59,269
It certainly was, Your Highness.

485
02:59:59,339 --> 03:00:01,432
End of day's play.

486
03:00:01,509 --> 03:00:04,068
Great bowling, Yardley.
Well bowled.

487
03:00:04,144 --> 03:00:06,009
We've got them on the run.

488
03:01:01,501 --> 03:01:05,165
We've lost five of
our best batsmen.

489
03:01:07,674 --> 03:01:09,266
What'll we do now?

490
03:01:26,860 --> 03:01:29,227
O Saviour!

491
03:01:32,567 --> 03:01:36,866
O Pure of Essence
Our Dearly Beloved

492
03:02:01,496 --> 03:02:03,395
O Saviour!

493
03:02:04,165 --> 03:02:06,564
O Pure of Essence
Our Dearly Beloved

494
03:02:07,100 --> 03:02:11,400
We have no one but You

495
03:02:15,743 --> 03:02:19,907
Ease our troubles
O Lord

496
03:02:21,682 --> 03:02:25,915
We have no one but You

497
03:02:30,358 --> 03:02:35,852
You alone
are our sole support

498
03:02:36,129 --> 03:02:40,395
You alone
are our protector

499
03:02:41,802 --> 03:02:45,863
We have no one but You

500
03:02:53,548 --> 03:02:57,245
We have no one but You

501
03:03:13,801 --> 03:03:17,897
You have filled
the moon with light

502
03:03:18,673 --> 03:03:22,802
The sun shines
only because of You

503
03:03:30,551 --> 03:03:40,187
Your splendour lights
the sky with stars

504
03:03:42,028 --> 03:03:43,689
O Lord

505
03:03:44,831 --> 03:03:51,395
If not You, who will
preserve this life!

506
03:03:54,342 --> 03:03:58,506
O Saviour! O Pure of Essence!
Our Dearly Beloved

507
03:03:59,980 --> 03:04:04,314
We have no one but You

508
03:04:34,948 --> 03:04:43,083
If You'd heed, O Lord
we make this plea

509
03:04:43,557 --> 03:04:46,025
To those who suffer
grant this courage

510
03:04:46,259 --> 03:04:48,785
May not hardship
ever defeat them

511
03:04:48,963 --> 03:04:51,431
To the weak
give Your protection

512
03:04:51,698 --> 03:04:54,259
So they may live in peace

513
03:04:54,602 --> 03:04:58,230
To devotion
give strength

514
03:05:06,112 --> 03:05:10,812
You are the Lord of
all universe

515
03:05:11,618 --> 03:05:15,919
Listen to this plea

516
03:05:17,625 --> 03:05:22,391
When the path is full
of darkness

517
03:05:23,631 --> 03:05:28,330
Give us the boon of light

518
03:05:30,270 --> 03:05:32,637
O Saviour!

519
03:05:32,974 --> 03:05:35,772
O Pure of Essence
Our Dearly Beloved

520
03:05:35,942 --> 03:05:39,743
We have no one but You

521
03:05:41,314 --> 03:05:45,649
Ease our troubles
O Lord

522
03:05:47,121 --> 03:05:51,022
We have no one but You

523
03:06:21,022 --> 03:06:24,685
O Saviour!

524
03:06:50,583 --> 03:06:52,916
Bhuvan has completed 50 runs!

525
03:06:58,291 --> 03:07:03,251
That must be the first 50 in the history
of Indian village cricket.

526
03:07:06,366 --> 03:07:07,628
Come on, run!

527
03:07:09,936 --> 03:07:12,929
And with this,
Isar Kaka completes ten runs.

528
03:07:14,141 --> 03:07:16,301
Very good!
- Well done!

529
03:07:45,506 --> 03:07:48,099
Hold it up, Wesson.
Concentrate, field.

530
03:07:55,516 --> 03:07:56,483
One more!

531
03:08:23,843 --> 03:08:25,402
I lost, Bhuvan.

532
03:08:28,716 --> 03:08:30,512
I couldn't run.

533
03:08:31,886 --> 03:08:33,547
Couldn't run...

534
03:08:35,689 --> 03:08:37,281
It was my fault.

535
03:08:40,294 --> 03:08:42,022
I couldn't run.

536
03:08:49,403 --> 03:08:52,031
"Tormentors of the weak!
Beware! You will pay."

537
03:08:52,205 --> 03:08:55,198
"The sighs of the oppressed
shall turn iron to ashes!"

538
03:08:55,375 --> 03:08:56,967
Keep the flag flying, Guran.

539
03:09:05,318 --> 03:09:08,447
My goodness.
- Coming from the jungle?

540
03:09:11,658 --> 03:09:14,525
Stand back. Make way.
- Don't get too close, Smithy.

541
03:09:15,295 --> 03:09:17,160
Watch yourself.

542
03:09:17,230 --> 03:09:19,528
What on earth is he doing?

543
03:09:19,599 --> 03:09:20,931
This way, sir.

544
03:09:24,839 --> 03:09:28,865
What an extraordinary stance.
It looks as if he's riding a horse.

545
03:09:40,653 --> 03:09:42,314
Well struck, sir.

546
03:09:42,388 --> 03:09:46,450
Umpire, he can't do that.
It's not cricket.

547
03:09:46,527 --> 03:09:49,325
Hit the ball only once, Guran.

548
03:09:49,996 --> 03:09:50,964
Okay.

549
03:09:51,798 --> 03:09:53,459
Hail Hanuman,
The Almighty Ape!

550
03:09:53,868 --> 03:09:56,734
That's called "kicking the horse."
- Indeed.

551
03:09:58,638 --> 03:10:00,470
Run!
- Crack the enemy's back!

552
03:10:06,346 --> 03:10:10,044
He is coming, Bhuvan!
Sock it to him!

553
03:10:12,253 --> 03:10:14,346
Keep it up!

554
03:10:23,029 --> 03:10:24,894
Come on, Feringhee!

555
03:10:40,113 --> 03:10:42,173
Rot in hell!

556
03:10:46,186 --> 03:10:47,586
One more, Guran!

557
03:10:47,754 --> 03:10:49,689
I'll whack so hard
you'll whine for your Ma!

558
03:10:56,429 --> 03:10:59,125
So what does your Ma say, eh?

559
03:11:04,104 --> 03:11:06,128
Hail Hanuman!

560
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:14,108
Why're you shouting?

561
03:11:14,847 --> 03:11:16,008
Yes!

562
03:11:17,083 --> 03:11:18,948
Damn and blast you!

563
03:11:32,233 --> 03:11:34,666
Goli, my son. Stay put.

564
03:11:35,568 --> 03:11:38,333
Only Bhura and Kachra
are left after you.

565
03:11:38,504 --> 03:11:39,631
Father, play steady.

566
03:11:39,807 --> 03:11:41,775
Hit hard, Goli.
- Do us proud.

567
03:11:43,410 --> 03:11:45,570
Don't scare him, idiots!
Just stay there.

568
03:11:49,750 --> 03:11:50,943
Steady, Goli.

569
03:11:52,785 --> 03:11:54,447
Come on, Willis,
he's nervous.

570
03:12:13,107 --> 03:12:14,971
Out the first ball!

571
03:12:15,174 --> 03:12:19,168
Wait, Bhura. I'll go.
- In this condition?

572
03:12:24,884 --> 03:12:25,874
Interesting.

573
03:12:28,822 --> 03:12:30,846
They're giving you a hat trick, Willis.

574
03:12:32,625 --> 03:12:34,820
But how will you run, Ismayeel?

575
03:12:35,795 --> 03:12:40,495
The umpires have decided to let
another player run for Ismayeel.

576
03:12:43,336 --> 03:12:48,104
When I call you, run.
Stay behind the line, understand?

577
03:12:48,676 --> 03:12:52,134
Good. Go stand there.
But inside the line!

578
03:12:55,015 --> 03:12:57,141
Thank God you are here, Ismayeel.

579
03:13:00,487 --> 03:13:04,513
We have got to make the rest
of the runs. There's no one left.

580
03:13:05,158 --> 03:13:06,649
Don't worry, Bhuvan.

581
03:13:07,060 --> 03:13:10,224
By Allah's grace,
you'll see victory will be ours.

582
03:13:10,397 --> 03:13:13,525
We must not lose heart, that's all.

583
03:13:22,475 --> 03:13:23,704
Look at me, Tipu.

584
03:13:26,746 --> 03:13:27,873
Run, Tipu.

585
03:13:30,483 --> 03:13:32,884
Stop. Stay behind the line.

586
03:13:40,060 --> 03:13:41,391
Run, Tipu, run.

587
03:13:43,697 --> 03:13:46,392
Stop.
- Well done, lad.

588
03:14:21,868 --> 03:14:23,028
Catch it!

589
03:14:49,629 --> 03:14:51,426
Was it two or three?
- Three.

590
03:14:54,400 --> 03:14:57,495
The last hour of play is left now.

591
03:14:57,737 --> 03:15:02,732
20 overs will be bowled
during this time.

592
03:15:31,772 --> 03:15:34,467
Ismayeel has hit a six!

593
03:16:01,968 --> 03:16:03,698
Well played, young man.

594
03:16:03,836 --> 03:16:06,634
And with this six,
Bhuvan completes a century!

595
03:16:09,910 --> 03:16:13,174
I must say this country has
a brave future in this game.

596
03:16:24,157 --> 03:16:26,352
And that's Ismayeel's grand 50!

597
03:16:40,940 --> 03:16:43,205
Sir, how many runs must
we make to win?

598
03:16:43,376 --> 03:16:46,038
You have to make
30 runs in 18 balls.

599
03:16:46,580 --> 03:16:47,842
30 in 18?

600
03:17:19,413 --> 03:17:20,573
How's that, umpire?

601
03:17:23,115 --> 03:17:24,605
Well done, Willis!

602
03:17:24,685 --> 03:17:26,915
What a shame!

603
03:17:29,221 --> 03:17:30,883
Well done.
- Good thinking, sir.

604
03:17:30,958 --> 03:17:33,551
Well done.
- Thank you very much.

605
03:17:36,395 --> 03:17:38,727
Run along.
Your mother's waiting.

606
03:17:58,951 --> 03:18:00,384
No matter, Tipu.

607
03:18:04,991 --> 03:18:07,186
You played very well. Good!

608
03:18:20,173 --> 03:18:23,040
Father, why is Tipu coming back?

609
03:18:26,580 --> 03:18:31,573
And they have to make 28 runs
in 16 balls.

610
03:18:33,086 --> 03:18:35,554
Stay put at one end, Bhura.

611
03:18:35,756 --> 03:18:38,849
Don't let your wicket fall.
I'll make the runs. Good.

612
03:18:40,527 --> 03:18:42,791
This one's petrified, Willis.
Get him on strike.

613
03:18:42,862 --> 03:18:44,854
Come on, Willis.
Two more to go.

614
03:18:59,545 --> 03:19:02,743
Willis, hold it!
Smith, third man!

615
03:19:02,815 --> 03:19:04,477
Flynn, under it!

616
03:19:06,586 --> 03:19:08,746
Come on, Willis!
Keep it tight, men!

617
03:19:26,740 --> 03:19:29,833
You're not asleep, man!
What are you doing? Get him!

618
03:19:51,064 --> 03:19:53,294
That was marvellous!

619
03:19:57,336 --> 03:19:59,737
Willis, keep it tight.
Pitch it up, man.

620
03:19:59,806 --> 03:20:01,602
The ball is old, sir.
- Just do it!

621
03:20:01,674 --> 03:20:06,407
This is the last ball of
the over, Bhura. We must take a single.

622
03:20:07,246 --> 03:20:09,579
Only one run, not two!

623
03:20:11,785 --> 03:20:15,448
Gentlemen, step up.
Stop the single.

624
03:20:15,522 --> 03:20:19,390
I want this man on strike.
Step up!

625
03:20:35,141 --> 03:20:37,109
Good shot.
That's an over.

626
03:20:37,810 --> 03:20:40,108
This guy has turned it into four runs!

627
03:20:41,548 --> 03:20:44,278
You have to bat now, Bhura.

628
03:20:45,152 --> 03:20:47,950
Steady.
Don't let your wicket fall.

629
03:20:50,724 --> 03:20:52,884
Because of Captain Russell's
cleverness...

630
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:55,150
...Bhuvan couldn't take a single.

631
03:20:55,695 --> 03:20:58,128
Bhura has to bat now.

632
03:20:58,564 --> 03:21:03,798
Champaner now needs
12 runs from 12 balls.

633
03:21:04,904 --> 03:21:07,532
Keep it tight, Smith.
Get him on strike.

634
03:21:07,673 --> 03:21:10,575
Concentrate, gentlemen, concentrate!

635
03:21:24,557 --> 03:21:25,820
Go back, Bhura!

636
03:21:40,240 --> 03:21:42,970
Well done, sir. One more, sir.
- One more to go.

637
03:21:54,855 --> 03:21:59,554
Save us, Bhuvan my brother.
It's all in your hands now.

638
03:22:24,951 --> 03:22:26,179
You did the right thing.

639
03:22:29,388 --> 03:22:33,791
Go, Kachra. You have to give
Bhuvan support now.

640
03:22:35,628 --> 03:22:37,926
Just stay put, Kachra.
- Don't be afraid.

641
03:22:38,397 --> 03:22:39,865
Say a prayer and go.

642
03:22:40,333 --> 03:22:42,528
All right, gentlemen.
We remember this chap, don't we?

643
03:22:42,602 --> 03:22:43,762
Yes, we do.

644
03:22:47,706 --> 03:22:52,644
Oh, dear.
Last man in and he's severely disabled.

645
03:22:54,047 --> 03:22:56,447
Now, only the last batsman is left.

646
03:22:56,716 --> 03:22:59,616
And they need to make 12 runs
from 11 balls.

647
03:22:59,685 --> 03:23:01,186
Wesson, short legs. Stay in closer.
- Right, sir.

648
03:23:01,186 --> 03:23:03,347
Wesson, short legs. Stay in closer.
- Right, sir.

649
03:23:03,423 --> 03:23:05,152
Playing, field!
- North!

650
03:23:05,825 --> 03:23:07,314
Come on, Smith.

651
03:23:18,371 --> 03:23:19,861
And again.

652
03:23:23,709 --> 03:23:25,939
Come on, Smith,
he's a sitting duck.

653
03:23:26,813 --> 03:23:28,177
Be careful, Kachra.

654
03:23:37,624 --> 03:23:39,524
You aren't hurt, are you?

655
03:23:52,471 --> 03:23:54,599
Good delivery.

656
03:24:03,883 --> 03:24:05,214
Don't be afraid.

657
03:24:05,285 --> 03:24:07,480
Come on, Smith!
Take him, man.

658
03:24:07,554 --> 03:24:09,112
Just touch and run!

659
03:24:19,733 --> 03:24:20,825
Just once!

660
03:24:22,402 --> 03:24:23,391
Run!

661
03:24:28,741 --> 03:24:30,538
Well done, Kachra!
Stop.

662
03:24:37,483 --> 03:24:40,577
Kachra, this is the last ball.
We must take only one run.

663
03:24:41,286 --> 03:24:42,310
Be ready.

664
03:24:42,721 --> 03:24:47,420
Gentlemen, close in, move in.
Save the one. Keep him this end.

665
03:25:05,512 --> 03:25:06,910
Run, Kachra!

666
03:25:15,355 --> 03:25:16,583
Made it!

667
03:25:18,490 --> 03:25:19,650
Well done!

668
03:25:23,163 --> 03:25:27,189
Six balls left and ten runs
to score for victory.

669
03:25:28,500 --> 03:25:32,163
Gentlemen, I want everybody
to keep on their toes.

670
03:25:32,237 --> 03:25:33,727
Be alert.

671
03:25:33,807 --> 03:25:36,673
Save the twos.
Save the boundaries.

672
03:25:36,708 --> 03:25:39,006
But if they take the single,
let them have it.

673
03:25:39,445 --> 03:25:41,346
Let the cripple take the strike.

674
03:25:53,459 --> 03:25:55,951
Yardley, I'm depending on you.

675
03:25:56,895 --> 03:26:00,923
Don't give away anything.
Just get him.

676
03:26:02,402 --> 03:26:03,891
Gentlemen!

677
03:26:50,717 --> 03:26:53,777
Well done, Yardley.
That won't do us any harm.

678
03:26:54,153 --> 03:26:56,748
Are you all right,
Bhuvan Bhaiyya?

679
03:27:10,970 --> 03:27:12,631
Keep it up.

680
03:27:29,054 --> 03:27:31,818
Run! Take two.

681
03:27:36,161 --> 03:27:37,390
Stop! Go back!

682
03:27:46,038 --> 03:27:49,338
Kachra, we have to take just one run.

683
03:27:50,642 --> 03:27:51,836
Touch and run!

684
03:27:51,910 --> 03:27:54,538
All right, gentlemen, close in.
Close in.

685
03:27:54,613 --> 03:27:56,945
Come on, you men in the field.
Come on.

686
03:28:06,858 --> 03:28:08,884
Good bowling, Yardley.

687
03:28:11,698 --> 03:28:14,189
We have to take a run
from this ball.

688
03:28:14,500 --> 03:28:17,263
Only the last two balls
are left, understand?

689
03:28:17,436 --> 03:28:18,767
We have to take the run!

690
03:28:21,107 --> 03:28:25,634
Come on, Yardley.
Dig one in, Yardley.

691
03:28:26,211 --> 03:28:27,769
Take the run, Kachra.

692
03:28:29,081 --> 03:28:31,846
We have to take one run!

693
03:28:33,519 --> 03:28:36,352
Everybody close in.
Stop the single.

694
03:28:36,422 --> 03:28:37,581
Close in!

695
03:28:39,826 --> 03:28:41,850
Come on, Kachra.
Strike the ball.

696
03:28:54,540 --> 03:28:56,701
Only the last ball left...

697
03:29:12,458 --> 03:29:16,291
Kachra, this is the last
ball of the game.

698
03:29:17,297 --> 03:29:19,730
And we need five runs to win.

699
03:29:23,636 --> 03:29:26,730
You will have to lift the ball
over the boundary.

700
03:29:29,208 --> 03:29:30,834
Or else... triple Lagaan.

701
03:29:32,878 --> 03:29:35,142
All our lives are in your hands, Kachra.

702
03:29:36,516 --> 03:29:37,813
Do something!

703
03:29:40,185 --> 03:29:41,174
Do something.

704
03:29:48,427 --> 03:29:51,261
Come on, Yardley.
Just once more.

705
03:29:54,766 --> 03:29:56,256
Field.

706
03:30:00,839 --> 03:30:01,829
Hit it, Kachra!

707
03:30:03,842 --> 03:30:04,831
Hit!

708
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:05,900
Hit!

709
03:30:08,047 --> 03:30:09,240
Hit it, Kachra.

710
03:30:12,418 --> 03:30:13,544
Hit it, my son.

711
03:30:13,720 --> 03:30:14,846
Lift it, Kachra.

712
03:30:31,237 --> 03:30:33,033
No ball.

713
03:30:34,573 --> 03:30:36,064
No ball!

714
03:30:37,910 --> 03:30:39,706
What?
- No ball.

715
03:30:43,383 --> 03:30:44,873
You're kidding me.

716
03:30:44,951 --> 03:30:47,544
"No ball"?
What do you mean, "No ball"?

717
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:50,282
His foot was over the line.

718
03:30:50,355 --> 03:30:51,345
Yardley?

719
03:30:53,225 --> 03:30:55,057
Are you quite certain, umpire?

720
03:30:55,128 --> 03:30:57,756
I am not discussing it
any further, sir.

721
03:30:57,830 --> 03:31:00,560
I suggest we get on with the game.

722
03:31:02,868 --> 03:31:04,358
Very well.

723
03:31:04,436 --> 03:31:08,237
Gentlemen, we have one more ball.
Back to your positions.

724
03:31:08,307 --> 03:31:11,935
Because of their no-ball,
we have got one more ball!

725
03:31:26,092 --> 03:31:28,286
We can't afford any mistakes this time.

726
03:31:32,464 --> 03:31:34,455
Gentlemen, back to the boundary.

727
03:31:37,503 --> 03:31:39,868
Everybody back to the boundaries.
Back!

728
03:31:55,387 --> 03:31:57,685
If you lose, you will pay...

729
03:31:57,890 --> 03:31:59,551
...triple Lagaan.

730
03:32:00,993 --> 03:32:02,790
Do you accept?

731
03:32:05,631 --> 03:32:07,222
It's this impossible bet...

732
03:32:07,400 --> 03:32:08,560
...that Bhuvan has accepted!

733
03:32:09,168 --> 03:32:10,634
What have you done?

734
03:32:10,802 --> 03:32:13,931
Back! Back! Back!

735
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:15,200
I had told you...

736
03:32:15,508 --> 03:32:17,373
...we can face a great calamity.

737
03:32:17,543 --> 03:32:18,669
Didn't I say so?

738
03:32:28,920 --> 03:32:31,253
You talk just like your father.

739
03:32:31,690 --> 03:32:33,682
He was so spirited...

740
03:32:33,993 --> 03:32:35,426
...spoke the truth.

741
03:32:44,102 --> 03:32:46,070
I have faith in you...

742
03:32:46,873 --> 03:32:48,339
...and in your courage.

743
03:33:07,158 --> 03:33:09,490
Catch it, sir!

744
03:33:13,198 --> 03:33:14,791
Catch it, sir!

745
03:33:19,939 --> 03:33:21,338
Please don't catch it!

746
03:33:25,644 --> 03:33:26,634
Yeah!

747
03:33:56,275 --> 03:33:59,004
We have won!!

748
03:34:04,516 --> 03:34:05,847
He's done it!

749
03:34:24,336 --> 03:34:26,634
Completely unbelievable.

750
03:36:51,983 --> 03:36:56,216
Unable to bear this humiliation,
the British government...

751
03:36:56,721 --> 03:37:00,054
...decided to shut down
the Champaner Cantonment.

752
03:37:00,625 --> 03:37:04,426
"By the power vested in me
by Her Majesty, Queen Victoria...

753
03:37:04,496 --> 03:37:07,988
...I hereby declare that
after much deliberation on the matter...

754
03:37:08,067 --> 03:37:11,968
...the Cantonment at Champaner
be dissolved.

755
03:37:12,036 --> 03:37:15,028
And the officers and troops
of the erstwhile Cantonment...

756
03:37:15,107 --> 03:37:17,472
...shall relocate
and re-establish themselves...

757
03:37:17,543 --> 03:37:22,105
...in the princely state of Raj Gardh
with immediate effect.

758
03:37:22,181 --> 03:37:27,983
Signed, Colonel J. R. Boyer,
Commanding Officer, Central Provinces."

759
03:37:30,955 --> 03:37:34,413
I did not believe I'd live
to see this day.

760
03:38:14,633 --> 03:38:17,932
Be happy, my daughter.
Live long.

761
03:38:50,669 --> 03:38:55,163
Memsahib, we will never forget
all that you have done for us.

762
03:39:01,179 --> 03:39:02,669
I won't either.

763
03:39:27,406 --> 03:39:31,240
And so, not just Champaner but
all the villages in the province...

764
03:39:31,477 --> 03:39:35,378
...did not have to pay Lagaan
for three years.

765
03:39:35,580 --> 03:39:38,516
Captain Russell had to pay
for his capricious behaviour.

766
03:39:39,217 --> 03:39:42,653
Besides having to pay triple Lagaan,
he was transferred...

767
03:39:42,922 --> 03:39:45,549
...to the Central African desert.

768
03:39:47,493 --> 03:39:51,394
Elizabeth returned to England
holding Bhuvan in her heart.

769
03:39:52,698 --> 03:39:57,362
She did not marry and remained
Bhuvan's Radha all her life.

770
03:39:58,436 --> 03:40:00,927
Bhuvan and Gauri had a
splendid wedding.

771
03:40:01,540 --> 03:40:04,532
Raja Puran Singh himself came
to bless the newly-weds...

772
03:40:04,709 --> 03:40:07,371
...enhancing Champaner's status
even more.

773
03:40:08,213 --> 03:40:11,080
Even after this historic victory...

774
03:40:11,450 --> 03:40:15,545
...Bhuvan's name was lost
somewhere in the pages of history.
