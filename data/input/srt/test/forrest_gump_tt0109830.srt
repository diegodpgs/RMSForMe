00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:24,059
Hello. My name's Forrest - Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,943
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,952
I could eat about a million and a half of these.

4
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,954
My mama always said

5
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:44,754
Life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,956
You never know what you're going to get.

7
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,309
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,745
I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that

9
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,750
and not feel a thing.

10
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:10,424
I wish I had shoes like that.

11
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,926
My feet hurt .

12
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:14,929
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,934
you can tell about a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,937
Where they're going,

15
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,472
where they've been.

16
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,075
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,956
I bet if I think about it real hard

18
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,459
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,260
Mama said they'd take me anywhere .

20
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,420
She said they was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,934
All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now .

22
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,307
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,547
How do those feel?

24
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,260
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,765
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,895
But his back's as crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,340
But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,673
Forrest!

29
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,407
Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,246
Mama named me after the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,320
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,412
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:37,924
She said we was related to him in some way.

34
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,426
What he did was,

35
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:42,930
he tarted up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,435
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets

37
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:50,941
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,945
They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:59,075
And, anyway, that'show I got my name... Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:02,485
Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me

41
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,491
that sometimes we all do things that, well,

42
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,994
that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,893
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,123
All right.

45
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,132
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,634
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,694
a little boy with braces on his legs before ?

48
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,374
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,876
tell you they're better than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,380
If God intended everybody to be the same,

51
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,384
he'd have given us all braces on our legs.

52
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:43,388
Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:47,926
We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,

54
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:50,931
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,935
That's in the county of Greenbow.

56
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,438
Our house had been in Mama's family

57
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,566
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

58
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:02,079
had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.

59
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,514
Since it was just me and Mama

60
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,517
and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,020
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,522
mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,186
Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:17,198
That's how me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,030
Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,037
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:25,131
You're no different than anybody else is.

68
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,879
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

69
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,382
You're the same as everybody else.

70
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,385
You are no different.

71
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,118
Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gump.

72
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,628
His I.Q is 75.

73
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,221
Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,562
Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,239
She wanted me to have the finest education

76
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:54,744
so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,747
I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,081
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.

79
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,554
Now, this is normal.

80
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:08,618
Forrest is right here .

81
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,530
The state require s a minimum I.Q of 80

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,329
to attend public school.

83
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,699
Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,671
he's going to have to go to a special school.

85
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,175
Now, he'll be just fine.

86
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,678
What does normal mean anyway ?

87
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,681
He might be...

88
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,876
a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,385
but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,389
is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,551
He's not going to some special school

92
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,562
to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,622
We're talking about five little points here .

94
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,370
There must be something can be done.

95
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,900
We're a progressive school system.

96
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,742
We don't want to see anybody left behind.

97
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:55,583
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,335
He's on vacation.

99
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,325
Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.

100
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,528
You don't say much, do you?

101
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,126
"Finally, he had to try.

102
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,135
"It looked easy, but...

103
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:48,798
oh, what happened. First they..."

104
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:52,139
Mama, what's vacation mean?

105
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,473
Vacation?

106
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,310
Where Daddy went?

107
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:59,982
Vacation's when you go somewhere...

108
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,655
and you don't ever come back.

109
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,666
Anyway, I guess you could say

110
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,295
me and Mama was on our own.

111
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,338
But we didn't mind.

112
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,841
Our house was never empty.

113
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,845
There was always folks coming and going.

114
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,005
Supper!

115
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,515
It's supper, everyone!

116
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,108
That sure looks special.

117
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:28,018
Sometimes, we had so many people staying with us

118
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,525
that every room was filled, with travelers, you know,

119
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,028
folks living out of their suitcases

120
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,532
and hat cases and sample cases.

121
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:41,298
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?

122
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:44,205
One time, a young man was staying with us,

123
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,370
and he had him a guitar case.

124
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,718
# Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit #

125
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,383
# And you ain't no #

126
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,983
# Friend of mine #

127
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:02,455
Forrest,

128
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,296
I told you not to bother this nice young man.

129
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,802
No, that's all right, ma'am.

130
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,306
I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar.

131
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,310
All right. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat.

132
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,314
Yeah, that sounds good.  Thank you, ma'am.

133
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:19,818
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you did there .

134
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,319
Slow it down some.

135
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,857
# You ain't nothing but... #

136
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,223
I liked that guitar.

137
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,889
It sounded good.

138
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:34,199
I started moving around to the music,

139
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,205
swinging my hips.

140
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,366
# Cryin' all the time #

141
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,933
This one night,

142
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:41,945
me and Mama was out shopping,

143
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,448
and we walked by Vincy's Furniture and Appliance Store,

144
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,506
and guess what?

145
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:51,992
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog #

146
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,120
# Cryin' all the time #

147
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,766
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog #

148
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:01,736
This is not for children's eyes.

149
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,864
# Cryin' all the time #

150
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,374
Some years later,

151
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,378
that handsome young man who they called the King,

152
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,348
well, he sung too many songs.

153
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,352
Had him self a heart attack or something.

154
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,412
It must be hard being a king.

155
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,363
You know, it's funny how you remember some things,

156
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,364
but some things you can't.

157
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,900
You do your very best now, Forrest.

158
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,371
I sure will, Mama.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,967
I remember the bus ride on the first day of school

160
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,376
very well.

161
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,315
Are you coming along?

162
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,879
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers .

163
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,482
This is the bus to school.

164
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,762
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

165
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm Dorothy Harris.

166
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:56,137
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore .

167
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,584
This seat's taken.

168
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,457
It's taken.

169
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,463
You can't sit here .

170
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,714
You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,

171
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:33,114
'cause I don 't remember being born.

172
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:36,586
I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,

173
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,089
and I don't know

174
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,591
when I went on my first outdoor picnic,

175
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,094
but I do remember

176
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:46,155
the first time I heard the sweetest voice

177
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,134
in the wide world.

178
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:51,139
You can sit here if you want.

179
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,345
I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

180
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,009
She was like an angel.

181
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,851
Well, are you going to sit down or aren't you?

182
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,986
What's wrong with your legs?

183
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:11,998
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

184
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,864
My legs are just fine and dandy.

185
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:17,871
I just sat next to her on that bus

186
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,875
and had a conversation all the way to school.

187
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,378
My back's crooked like a question mark.

188
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,075
Next to Mama, no one ever talked to me

189
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,551
or asked me questions.

190
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,884
Are you stupid or something?

191
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,016
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

192
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:37,086
I'm Jenny .

193
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,724
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

194
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,235
From that day on, we was always together.

195
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,864
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.

196
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,877
She taught me how to climb.

197
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,438
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

198
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,178
I showed her how to dangle.

199
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,777
"A good little..."

200
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,289
She helped me learn how to read,

201
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,452
and I showed her how to swing.

202
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,031
Sometimes, we'd just sitout

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,398
and wait for the stars.

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,938
Mama's going to worry about me.

205
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,907
Just stay a little longer.

206
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:18,072
For some reason, Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

207
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,912
O.K.,Jenny, I'll stay .

208
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:25,286
She was my most special friend.

209
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,257
My only friend.

210
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,933
Now, my mama always told me

211
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,935
that miracles happen every day

212
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,938
Some people don't think so,

213
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,496
but they do.

214
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,870
Hey, dummy!

215
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,416
Are you dumb, or just plain stupid?

216
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:49,247
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

217
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,651
Just run away, Forrest.

218
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,088
Run, Forrest!

219
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,252
Run away! Hurry!

220
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,885
Get the bikes!

221
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,760
Let's get him! Come on!

222
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,629
Look out, Gump!

223
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,567
We're going to get you!

224
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:05,765
Run, Forrest, run!

225
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,866
Run, Forrest!

226
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,803
Come back here, you!

227
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,396
Run, Forrest!

228
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,059
Run!

229
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,271
Now, you wouldn't believe if I told you...

230
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,576
but I could run like the wind blows.

231
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,909
From that day on,

232
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,422
if I was going somewhere,

233
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,857
I was running.

234
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,028
That boy sure is a running fool.

235
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,933
Now, remember how I told you

236
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,936
that Jenny never seemed to want to go home?

237
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,372
She lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.

238
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:06,071
Her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5,

239
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:10,584
and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.

240
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:11,880
Jenny?

241
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,889
He was a very loving man.

242
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,122
He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.

243
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,899
And then this one time,

244
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,902
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

245
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,405
Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?

246
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,908
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

247
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,069
Jenny!

248
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,409
Come on!

249
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,416
Jenny, where'd you run to?

250
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,010
You better get back here, girl!

251
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,155
Where you at?

252
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:48,930
Jenny!

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,865
Jenny, where you at?

254
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:54,639
Jenny!

255
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,640
Pray with me, Forrest.

256
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,142
Pray with me.

257
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,439
Jenny!

258
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,811
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,

259
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,817
far, far away from here .

260
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:09,823
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far.

261
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,827
Mama always said God is mysterious.

262
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,226
Jenny!

263
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:17,232
He didn 't turn Jenny in to a bird that day.

264
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,063
Instead,

265
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,071
he had the police say

266
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,575
Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.

267
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:27,077
She was to live with her grandma,

268
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,081
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

269
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,142
which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.

270
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,615
Some nights,

271
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,624
Jenny'd sneak out

272
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:40,126
and come on over to my house,

273
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,630
just'cause she said she was scared.

274
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:45,691
Scared of what, I don 't know.

275
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,431
But I think it was her grandma's dog.

276
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:51,441
He was a mean dog.

277
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,673
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

278
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,237
all the way up through high school.

279
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,683
Hey, stupid!

280
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,720
Quit it!

281
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,221
Run, Forrest, run!

282
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,784
didn't you hear me, stupid?

283
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:06,793
Run, Forrest!

284
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,193
Get in the truck!

285
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:11,597
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!

286
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,136
Run, Forrest! Run!

287
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,105
Move it! Move it!

288
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,011
You better be runnin'!

289
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:39,227
- Whoo-hoo! - Go!

290
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,330
Run, Forrest!

291
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,002
Now, it used to be

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,015
I ran to get where I was going.

293
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,417
I never thought it would take me anywhere .

294
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,116
Who in the hell is that?

295
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:27,991
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

296
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:30,054
Just a local idiot.

297
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,498
And can you believe it?

298
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,367
I got to go to college, too.

299
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,512
Forrest, move it!

300
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,513
Run!

301
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:44,514
O.K. !

302
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,676
Run!

303
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,584
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

304
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,339
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

305
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,240
Run! Run! Go!

306
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:24,064
He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive ,

307
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,100
but he sure is fast.

308
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,936
Now, maybe it's just me,

309
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:34,068
but college was very confusing times.

310
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:37,745
Federal troops, enforcing a court order,

311
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,079
integrated the University of Alabama today.

312
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,676
Two Negroes were admitted,

313
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,688
but only after Governor George Wallace

314
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,691
had carried out his symbolic threat

315
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,193
to stand in the school house door.

316
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:51,026
I take it from that statement...

317
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,033
Earl, what's going on?

318
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:55,535
Coons are trying to get into school.

319
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,540
Coons? When raccoons tried getting on our back porch,

320
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:01,042
Mama just chased them off with a broom.

321
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:02,976
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.

322
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,982
And they want to go to school with us.

323
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,985
With us? They do?

324
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,988
Shortly after Govern or Wallace

325
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,991
had carried out his promise to block the door way,

326
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,120
Kennedy ordered these cretary of defense to use military force.

327
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,529
Here, by video tape, is the encounter

328
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,033
by General Graham, commander of the National Guard,

329
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,661
and Governor Wallace.

330
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:25,502
Because these National Guardsmen

331
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:29,011
are here today as federal soldiers for Alabama,

332
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,014
and they live within our borders.

333
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,016
They are our brothers.

334
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,679
We are winning in this fight,

335
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:38,689
because we are awakening the American people

336
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:42,694
to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times

337
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,697
that is so evident today...

338
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:48,565
A trend toward military dictatorship in this country.

339
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,541
And so, at day's end,

340
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:57,067
the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

341
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,672
and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone

342
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,619
had been signed up for summer classes.

343
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,186
Ma'am, you dropped your book.

344
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,852
Ma'am.

345
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,362
Govern or Wallace did what he promised.

346
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:15,027
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob...

347
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,570
Say, wasn't that Gump?

348
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:18,663
Naw, that couldn't be.

349
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:21,676
It sure as hell was.

350
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,050
A few years later,

351
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,552
that angry little man at the school house door

352
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,647
thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.

353
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,758
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

354
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:41,426
But he didn't die.

355
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,542
My bus is here .

356
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,545
Is it the number 9?

357
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,547
No, it's the number 4.

358
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,141
It was nice talking to you.

359
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,053
I remember when that happened,

360
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,558
when Wallace got shot.

361
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,992
I was in college.

362
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:05,496
Did you go to a girls' college

363
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,932
or a girls' and boys' together college?

364
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,195
It was coed.

365
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,000
'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.

366
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,166
It was a college just for girls.

367
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:17,679
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.

368
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,469
#I don't know why I love you#

369
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:30,033
# But I do #

370
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,874
#I don't know why I cry so #

371
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,421
# But I do #

372
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,960
#I only know I know that... #

373
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,467
That hurts.

374
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:54,497
# But I don't know why I love you#

375
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:57,567
# But I do #

376
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,107
Forrest!

377
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,449
Forrest!

378
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,455
Forrest, stop it!

379
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,956
Stop it!

380
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,459
What are you doing?

381
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,960
He was hurting you.

382
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,462
No, he wasn't!

383
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,465
Get over there !

384
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,966
Billy, I'm sorry.

385
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:17,469
Just keep away from me.

386
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,471
Don't be such... Don't go.

387
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,473
Billy, wait a second.

388
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,908
He doesn't know any better.

389
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:28,573
Forrest, why'd you do that?

390
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:34,490
I brought you some chocolate.

391
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:35,786
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,997
I'll go back to my college now .

393
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,329
Forrest...

394
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,096
Look at you.

395
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,509
Come on.

396
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:51,670
Come on.

397
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,288
Is this your own room?

398
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,289
Shh!

399
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,139
Do you ever dream, Forrest...

400
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,642
about who you're going to be?

401
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,312
Who I'm going to be?

402
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,312
Yeah.

403
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:16,315
Aren't I going to be me?

404
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,646
You'll always be you,

405
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,653
just another kind of you.

406
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,815
You know?

407
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,825
I want to be famous.

408
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,657
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

409
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,667
I just want to be...

410
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,168
on an empty stage

411
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,831
with my guitar, my voice.

412
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,501
Just me.

413
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:42,681
And I want to reach people on a personal level.

414
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:47,521
I want to be able to say things,

415
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,022
just one to one.

416
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,458
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

417
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:01,804
I sit next to them

418
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:04,365
in my home economics class all the time.

419
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,574
Oh, I'm sorry.

420
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:35,672
It's O.K.

421
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:36,681
Sorry.

422
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:45,416
It's all right.

423
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,098
It's O.K.

424
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh, I'm dizzy .

425
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:02,879
I'll bet that never happened in home ec.

426
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,554
No.

427
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,695
I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.

428
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,199
I don't care . I don't like her anyway .

429
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,862
Run! Run! Run! Run!

430
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:25,031
Run! Run! Run! Run!

431
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,540
Run! Run! Run! Run!

432
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,577
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

433
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:31,580
Stop! Stop! Stop!

434
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,721
College ran by real fast

435
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,906
'cause I played so much football.

436
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,166
They even put me on a thing

437
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,674
called the all-America team

438
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,506
where you get to meet

439
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,513
the president of the United States.

440
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,843
President Kennedy met

441
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,077
with the collegiate all-American football team

442
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,535
at the Oval Office today .

443
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,363
Now the really good thing

444
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:57,373
about meeting the president of the United States

445
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:58,874
is the food.

446
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:01,207
They put you in this little room

447
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,874
with just about anything you'd want to eat or drink.

448
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,542
But since, number one,

449
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,211
I wasn 't hungry but thirsty,

450
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:10,882
and number two, they was free,

451
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,724
I must have drank me about 15 Dr. Peppers.

452
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,859
How does it feel to be an all-American?

453
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:21,198
It's an honor, sir.

454
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,864
How does it feel to be an all-American?

455
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,909
Very good, sir.

456
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:28,570
How does it feel to be an all-American ?

457
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,079
Very good, sir.

458
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:32,082
Congratulations. How do you feel?

459
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:34,585
I got to pee.

460
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:37,178
I believe he said he had to pee.

461
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:54,538
Some time later, for noparticular reason,

462
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:57,911
somebody shot that nice young president

463
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,383
when he was riding in his car.

464
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,318
And a few years after that,

465
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,822
somebody shot his little brother, too,

466
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:07,224
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

467
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,555
Must be hard being brothers.

468
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,464
I wouldn't know .

469
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:14,931
Forrest Gump.

470
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,437
Now can you believe it?

471
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:18,939
After only five years of playing football,

472
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,601
I got a college degree.

473
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,271
Congratulations, son.

474
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,474
Mama was so proud.

475
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,982
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.

476
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,646
I'll hold this for you.

477
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,816
Congratulations, son.

478
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,486
Have you given any thought to your future ?

479
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,032
Thought?

480
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:42,202
Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

481
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:43,863
Nobody gives a horse's shit

482
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,532
who you are, pus ball!

483
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:48,372
You're not even a lowlife , scum-sucking maggot!

484
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,709
Get your maggoty ass on the bus!

485
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:52,215
You're in the army now !

486
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:54,046
Seat's taken.

487
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,380
Taken.

488
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,361
At first it seemed like I made a mistake.

489
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,365
It was only my induction day,

490
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:07,492
and I was getting yelled at.

491
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,667
Sit down if you want to.

492
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:16,007
I didn't know who I might meet

493
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,513
or what they might ask.

494
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,345
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

495
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,181
No.

496
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:25,017
But I been on a real big boat.

497
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:28,026
I'm talking about a shrimp catching boat.

498
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:31,029
I been working on shrimp boats all my life .

499
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:33,362
I started out on my uncle's boat

500
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:35,368
when I was about maybe 9.

501
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:38,371
I was just looking into buying my own boat

502
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,374
and got drafted.

503
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:43,707
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

504
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,044
People call me Bubba,

505
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:48,551
just like one of them old red neck boys.

506
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:49,881
Can you believe that?

507
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:52,048
My name's Forrest Gump.

508
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:54,388
People call me Forrest Gump.

509
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,395
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

510
00:32:57,464 --> 00:32:59,193
and his mama cooked shrimp.

511
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:03,534
And her mama before her cooked shrimp,

512
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:07,200
and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too.

513
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,039
Bubba's family knew everything

514
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,545
there was to know about the shrimping business.

515
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,879
I know everything there is to know

516
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,212
about the shrimping business.

517
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,720
I'm going into the shrimping business for myself

518
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,053
after I get out of the army.

519
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:23,951
O.K.

520
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,292
Gump!

521
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:27,959
What's your sole purpose in this army?

522
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:30,469
To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!

523
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:34,133
God damn it, Gump, you're a goddamn genius.

524
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,643
That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard .

525
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:39,307
You must have a goddamn I.Q Of 160.

526
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,977
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

527
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,484
Listen up, people!

528
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,492
Now for some reason, I fit in the army

529
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,495
Like one of them round pegs.

530
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,825
It's not really hard.

531
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,832
You just make your bed neat,

532
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,333
remember to stand up straight,

533
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,994
and always answer every question

534
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,005
with "Yes, Drill Sergeant. "

535
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,506
Is that clear?

536
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,840
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

537
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:06,347
What you do is drag your nets along the bottom.

538
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,678
On a good day,

539
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:10,686
you can catch over a hundred pounds of shrimp.

540
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,017
Everything goes all right,

541
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,852
2 men shrimping 10 hours ,

542
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:16,018
Less what you spends on gas...

543
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:18,187
Done, Drill Sergeant!

544
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,697
Gump!

545
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,203
Why did you put that weapon together so quickly?

546
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,205
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

547
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,866
Jesus H. Christ.

548
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,876
This is a new company record .

549
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,378
If it wasn't a waste

550
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:32,880
of a fine enlisted man,

551
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,382
I'd recommend you for O.C.S., Private Gump.

552
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,716
You're going to be a general someday!

553
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,722
Now disassemble your weapon and continue!

554
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,727
Anyway, like I was saying,

555
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,060
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

556
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:49,396
You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it,

557
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,902
bake it, saute it.

558
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:54,065
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,

559
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:58,077
shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried,

560
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,408
stir fried.

561
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:01,245
There's pineapple shrimp

562
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:04,184
and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,

563
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:05,380
pepper shrimp,

564
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,889
shrimp soup, shrimp stew ,

565
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,551
shrimp salad,

566
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:11,390
shrimp in potatoes,

567
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:12,896
shrimp burger,

568
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:14,728
shrimp sandwich.

569
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,063
That...That's about it.

570
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:26,474
Night time in the army is alonely time.

571
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:28,982
We'd lay there in our bunks,

572
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,486
and I'd miss my mama,

573
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:34,148
and I'd miss Jenny.

574
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:39,496
Hey, Gump.

575
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:42,158
Get a load of the tits on her.

576
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,350
Turns out...

577
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:58,511
Jenny had gotten in to some trouble

578
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:01,853
over some photos of her in her college sweater.

579
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,121
And she was thrown out of school.

580
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,358
# My baby does the hanky panky #

581
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,866
But that wasn't a bad thing,

582
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:12,370
'cause a man who owns a theater

583
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:13,871
in Memphis, Tennessee,

584
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,532
saw those photos

585
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:19,375
and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.

586
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,540
The first chance I got,

587
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,880
I took the bus up to Memphis

588
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:26,217
to see her perform in that show.

589
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,722
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

590
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,224
Give her a big hand.

591
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:32,228
And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure ,

592
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:34,060
direct from Hollywood, California,

593
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:35,895
our very own beatnik beauty .

594
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,232
Let's give a big round of applause

595
00:36:38,304 --> 00:36:40,067
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.

596
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:55,087
# How many roads must a man walk down #

597
00:36:55,158 --> 00:37:00,529
# Before you can call him a man? #

598
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:06,799
# Yes, and how many seas must the white dove sail #

599
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,806
Her dream had come true.

600
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,809
# Before she sleeps in the sand? #

601
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:12,708
She was a folk singer.

602
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,874
# Yes, and how many times #

603
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,010
# Must the cannon balls fly #

604
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:23,685
# Before they're forever banned? #

605
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,091
Shake it up now.

606
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,594
Somebody get her a harmonica.

607
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,393
# The answer, my friend #

608
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:30,229
# Is blowin' in the wind #

609
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:31,735
This ain't Captain Kangaroo.

610
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:34,567
Hey, honey, I got something here for you.

611
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,699
Hey! God damn it!

612
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:39,040
Hey, you stupid jerk!

613
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:40,876
I'm singing a song here.

614
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:45,385
Polly, get out here!

615
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,887
Shut up yourself!

616
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:49,424
Just shut up!

617
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:54,930
Forrest! What are you doing here?

618
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:56,330
What are you doing?

619
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,165
What are you doing, Forrest?

620
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,263
Let me down!

621
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,871
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

622
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:10,375
You can't keep trying to rescue me.

623
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:12,240
They was trying to grab you.

624
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:14,645
A lot of people try to grab me.

625
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:18,708
Just...You can't keep doing this all the time.

626
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:22,314
I can't help it. I love you.

627
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:24,655
Forrest...

628
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:26,696
You don't know what love is.

629
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:36,374
You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?

630
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:41,213
We prayed for God to turn me into a bird

631
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:43,216
so I could fly far away .

632
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:46,044
Yes, I do.

633
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,459
You think I could fly off this bridge?

634
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,729
What do you mean, Jenny?

635
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,172
Nothing.

636
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,513
I got to get out of here .

637
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:14,847
Wait, Jenny.

638
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:17,357
Forrest, you stay away from me, O.K.?

639
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:19,360
You stay away from me, please.

640
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,862
Can I have a ride?

641
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,192
Where are you going?

642
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:23,357
I don't care .

643
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:24,662
Get in the truck.

644
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,930
So bye-bye, Jenny.

645
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,207
They sending me to Vietnam.

646
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,745
It's this whole other country.

647
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,082
Just hang on a minute.

648
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:44,591
Listen, you promise me something, O.K.?

649
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,594
Just if you're ever in trouble,

650
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:47,924
don't be brave .

651
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:50,933
You just run, O.K.? Just run away .

652
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:52,366
O.K.

653
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:58,872
Jenny.

654
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:03,541
I'll write you all the time.

655
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:13,933
And just like that, she was gone.

656
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,697
And just like that, she was gone.

657
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:33,389
You come back safe to me.

658
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,891
Do you hear?

659
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:56,071
# Some folks are born #

660
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:58,411
# Made to wave the flag #

661
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:01,748
# Ooh, they're red, white, and blue #

662
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,347
# And when the band plays "Hail To The Chief" #

663
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:09,018
# Ooh, they'll point the cannon at you #

664
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,857
# It ain't me #

665
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,863
# It ain't me #

666
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:16,025
# I ain't no senator's son #

667
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,864
# It ain't me #

668
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,369
Now they told us

669
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:22,372
that Vietnam was going to be very different

670
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,465
from the United States of America.

671
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:28,638
Except for all the beer cans and barbecues,

672
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,476
it was.

673
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:43,319
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp all in these waters .

674
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:46,330
They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp.

675
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:48,332
After we win this war

676
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,027
and we take over everything,

677
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,365
we can get American shrimpers out here

678
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,699
and shrimp these waters .

679
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,706
Just shrimp all the time, man.

680
00:41:58,443 --> 00:42:00,707
You must be my FNGs.

681
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:01,871
Morning, sir.

682
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:03,471
Oh, get your hands down.

683
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:04,981
Do not salute me.

684
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,484
There are goddamn snipers all around this area

685
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:09,645
who'd love to grease an officer.

686
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:12,986
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fort Platoon.

687
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:15,817
What's wrong with your lip?

688
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:19,159
I was born with big gums, sir.

689
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,323
Well, you better tuck that in.

690
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,833
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

691
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,504
Where are you boys from in the world?

692
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:28,664
- Alabama, sir! - Alabama, sir!

693
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:30,875
You twins?

694
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,705
No. We are not relations, sir.

695
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,044
Look,

696
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:40,448
it's pretty basic here .

697
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,781
You stick with me

698
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:44,287
and learn from the guys

699
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:46,290
who've been in country a while,

700
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,620
you'll be all right.

701
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,956
There is one item of G.I. gear

702
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:53,122
that can be the difference between life and death...

703
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,256
Socks.

704
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:56,357
Cushioned sole, O.D. green.

705
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:58,265
Try and keep your feet dry.

706
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,770
When we're out humpin', change your socks

707
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,033
whenever we stop.

708
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:04,371
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet

709
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:05,875
right off his legs.

710
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:07,377
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,

711
00:43:07,445 --> 00:43:09,879
where's that sling rope I said to order?

712
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,381
I put in the requisitions.

713
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:13,713
Well, you call those sons of bitches...

714
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,878
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.

715
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:18,889
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

716
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:22,620
He was from a long, great military tradition.

717
00:43:22,694 --> 00:43:25,219
Somebody in his family had fought

718
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:26,763
and died

719
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,423
in every...

720
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,626
single...

721
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:31,794
American war.

722
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,804
God damn it, kick some ass.

723
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,134
Get on it!

724
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:36,639
I guess you could say

725
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:39,142
he had a lot to live up to.

726
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:42,145
So, you boys from Arkansas, huh?

727
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:43,305
Well,

728
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:45,144
I been through there.

729
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:47,980
Little Rock's a fine town.

730
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:49,816
Now, shake down your gear.

731
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:51,150
See the platoon sergeant.

732
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,986
Draw what you need for the field.

733
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,492
If you boys are hungry,

734
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,324
we got steaks burning right over here .

735
00:43:58,396 --> 00:44:01,160
Two standing orders in this platoon...

736
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:03,757
1... take care of your feet,

737
00:44:03,835 --> 00:44:07,430
2... try not to do anything stupid,

738
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,097
Like getting yourself killed.

739
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:17,871
I sure hope I don't let him down.

740
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,995
I got to see a lot of the country side.

741
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:34,463
We would take these real long walks.

742
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:38,468
# There must be some kind of way #

743
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:40,629
# Out of here #

744
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:42,798
# Said the joker to the thief #

745
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:44,307
And we were always lookin'

746
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,309
for this guy named Charlie.

747
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:47,969
# There's too much confusion #

748
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,144
# I can't get no relief #

749
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,811
Hold it up!

750
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,320
Hold up, boys!

751
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,916
It wasn't always fun.

752
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:05,258
Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings

753
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,424
about a rock or a trail or the road,

754
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,435
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.

755
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,595
Get down!

756
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:13,762
Shut up!

757
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,101
So we did.

758
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:35,889
Now I don't know much about anything,

759
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,895
but I think some of America's best young men

760
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:40,225
served in this war.

761
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,562
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

762
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:46,732
Cleveland... he was from Detroit.

763
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:48,032
Hey, Tex.

764
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,596
Hey, Tex.

765
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,266
What the hell's going on?

766
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:53,537
And Tex was...

767
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:56,205
Well, I don't remember where Tex come from...

768
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:57,805
Ah, nothing.

769
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,744
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

770
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:06,722
Y'all got 10 clicks to go to that river.

771
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,383
Move out.

772
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:10,893
1, 2! Hup!

773
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:13,730
Step it up!

774
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,129
Look alive out there .

775
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,633
The good thing about Vietnam

776
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,965
is there was always someplace to go.

777
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,299
Fire in the hole!

778
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,469
Gump, check out that hole.

779
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,479
And there was always something to do.

780
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,639
Mount'em up!

781
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:32,512
Spread out! Cover his back!

782
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,183
One day it started raining,

783
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:43,591
and it didn't quit for four months.

784
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:47,097
We've been through every kind of rain there is...

785
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,793
little bitty stinging rain

786
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:53,524
and big old fat rain,

787
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,027
rain that flew in side ways,

788
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,806
and sometimes rain even seemed

789
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:01,215
to come straight up from underneath.

790
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:04,813
Shoot, it even rained at night.

791
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,652
Hey, Forrest.

792
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:07,815
Hey, Bubba.

793
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:10,159
I'm going to lean up against you.

794
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:11,663
You lean up against me.

795
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:13,997
This way we don't have to sleep

796
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:16,003
with our heads in the mud.

797
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,667
You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?

798
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:22,010
'Cause we be watching out for one another,

799
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:23,845
like brothers and stuff.

800
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,347
Hey, Forrest,

801
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,517
something I been thinking about.

802
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,528
I got a very important question to ask you.

803
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,199
How would you like to go

804
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,202
into the shrimping business with me?

805
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:41,038
O.K.

806
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,873
Man, I tell you what.

807
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,212
I got it all figured out, too.

808
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,717
So many pounds of shrimp

809
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,219
will pay off the boat.

810
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,721
So many pounds for gas.

811
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,722
We'll live right on the boat.

812
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:54,058
We ain't got to pay no rent.

813
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,063
We can just work it together,

814
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,066
split everything right down the middle.

815
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,229
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

816
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,333
Hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

817
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:07,506
That's a fine idea.

818
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:10,347
Bubba did have a fine idea.

819
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,600
I even wrote Jenny

820
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,165
and told her all about it.

821
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:19,828
I sent her letters...

822
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:21,998
Not every day, but almost.

823
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,339
I told her what I was doing

824
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:26,847
and asked her what she was doing

825
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:30,110
and told her how I thought about her always.

826
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,412
And how I was looking forward

827
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,415
to getting a letter from her

828
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:38,249
just as soon as she had the time.

829
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:41,259
I'd always let her know that I was O. K.

830
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:48,760
Then I'd sign each letter "Love, Forrest Gump. "

831
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,449
# There's somethin' happenin' here #

832
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:06,389
This one day, we was out walking like always,

833
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:10,230
and then, just like that,

834
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:12,236
somebody turned off the rain,

835
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:13,899
and the sun come out.

836
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:16,739
# I got to beware #

837
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:18,906
Ambush!

838
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,915
Take cover!

839
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:32,129
Get that pig up here, god damn it!

840
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:34,390
Forrest! You okay?

841
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:39,903
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!

842
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,771
Hey! We got a man down!

843
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:46,304
Strong-arm, this is Leg Lima 6! Over!

844
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,818
Roger, Strong-arm! Be advised we have incoming

845
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,289
from the tree line at point blue

846
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,690
plus two! A.K.s and rockets!

847
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,024
We're getting it hard!

848
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:56,654
Misfire! Misfire!

849
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:59,530
God damn it!

850
00:50:01,108 --> 00:50:05,041
Get that pig unfucked and on the treeline!

851
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,474
They got us, and it hurt.

852
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:13,045
We're going to move back to the blue line.

853
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,024
Pull back! Pull back!

854
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,084
Forrest! Run, Forrest!

855
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,892
Pull back!

856
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:22,162
Run! Run, man!

857
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,328
Run!

858
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,668
Pull back, Gump!

859
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:29,405
Run, God damn it! Run!

860
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:59,380
I ran and ran just like Jenny told me to.

861
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:04,325
I ran so far so fast

862
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:06,834
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

863
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:08,495
which was a bad thing.

864
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:09,663
Bubba.

865
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,336
Bubba was my best good friend.

866
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,850
I had to make sure he was O.K.

867
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:28,368
Where the hell are you?

868
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:30,527
Bubba!

869
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:33,540
And on my way back to find Bubba,

870
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:36,374
well, there was this boy laying on the ground.

871
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:37,435
Tex.

872
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,977
O.K.

873
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,489
I couldn't let him lay there all alone,

874
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:44,991
scared the way he was,

875
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,823
so I grabbed him up

876
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,625
and run him out of there.

877
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:06,584
Every time I went back looking for Bubba,

878
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:08,091
somebody else was saying,

879
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:11,094
"Help me, Forrest, help me! "

880
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,837
O.K. Here. Here .

881
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:25,118
No sweat, man. Lay back. You'll be O.K.

882
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:31,986
I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.

883
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,497
I know my position

884
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,465
is danger close!

885
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:37,971
We got Charlie all over this area.

886
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:40,975
I got to have those fast movers in here now. Over.

887
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:43,480
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

888
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:44,981
I know he's dead!

889
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:47,985
My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!

890
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:49,488
God damn it!

891
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,489
What are you doing?

892
00:52:51,562 --> 00:52:52,992
You leave me here!

893
00:52:53,064 --> 00:52:54,994
Get away . Just leave me here!

894
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,497
Get out!

895
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,503
Aah! God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

896
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:02,939
Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.

897
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,979
Be advised your fast movers are in bound. Over.

898
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,450
Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.

899
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:12,283
Aah! Something bit me!

900
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:21,133
You son of a bitch!

901
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:25,633
I can't leave the platoon.

902
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:27,644
I told you to leave me there, Gump.

903
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,682
Forget about me. Get your self out!

904
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,984
Did you hear what I said?

905
00:53:33,057 --> 00:53:35,490
Gump, damn it, put me down.

906
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:38,084
Get your ass out of here.

907
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:43,194
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, God damn you!

908
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,000
Where the hell do you think you're going?

909
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,708
To get Bubba.

910
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,713
I got an air strike in bound right now.

911
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:52,274
They're going to nape the whole area.

912
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,500
Stay here! That's an order.

913
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:56,321
I gotta find Bubba!

914
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,240
Forrest.

915
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:21,891
Bubba.

916
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:23,793
I'm O.K., Forrest.

917
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:25,389
I'm O.K.

918
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:35,836
O-Oh, Bubba, no.

919
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:37,714
I'll be all right.

920
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,188
Come on.

921
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,995
Come on. Come on.

922
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:55,671
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.

923
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,550
I'm O.K. I'm fine.

924
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:40,101
Top smoke. Get it up there .

925
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:43,046
If I'd have known this was going to be

926
00:55:43,118 --> 00:55:46,050
the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

927
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:49,055
I'd of thought of something better to say.

928
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:50,182
Hey, Bubba.

929
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,523
Hey, Forrest.

930
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:55,398
Forrest...

931
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:58,563
Why did this happen?

932
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:01,575
You got shot.

933
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:06,014
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.

934
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:09,646
I want to go home.

935
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:12,521
Bubba was my best good friend.

936
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:14,526
And even I know

937
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,034
that ain't something you can find just around the corner.

938
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:21,540
Bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain,

939
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,910
but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.

940
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,822
That's all I have to say about that.

941
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,226
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

942
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,569
A bullet?

943
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,368
That jumped up and bit you.

944
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:47,375
Oh. Yes, sir.

945
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,075
Bit me directly in the but-tocks .

946
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:54,589
They said it was a million dollar wound, but...

947
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:56,589
the army must keep that money ,

948
00:56:56,662 --> 00:57:00,595
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars .

949
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:04,424
The only good thing about being wounded in the but-tocks

950
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:06,322
is the ice cream.

951
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,295
They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.

952
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:10,799
And guess what?

953
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,770
A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.

954
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,138
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.

955
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:23,747
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

956
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,368
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

957
00:57:45,622 --> 00:57:47,018
Harper!

958
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,060
Cooper.

959
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,059
Larson.

960
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:56,396
Webster.

961
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,070
Gump.

962
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,572
Gump!

963
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,270
I'm Forrest Gump.

964
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:05,979
Kyle.

965
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:08,917
Nichols.

966
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,024
McMill.

967
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:14,081
Johnson.

968
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:28,130
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

969
00:58:30,939 --> 00:58:34,374
Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?

970
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,874
Turn it off.

971
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,379
You are tuned to the American forces

972
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:39,881
Vietnam network.

973
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,509
This is channel 6, Saigon.

974
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:45,615
Good catch, Gump.

975
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:49,360
You know how to play this?

976
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:53,436
Come on. Let me show you.

977
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:57,407
Now, the secret to this game is

978
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,407
no matter what happens,

979
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,913
never, ever...

980
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,075
take your eye off the ball.

981
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,253
All right.

982
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,930
For some reason,

983
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:15,435
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

984
00:59:15,505 --> 00:59:16,663
See?

985
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,933
Any idiot can play .

986
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:22,446
So I started playing it all the time.

987
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,142
I played Ping-Pong

988
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:27,812
even when I didn't have anyone to play Ping-Pong with.

989
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:37,599
The hospital's people

990
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:41,606
said it made me look like a duck in water...

991
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,108
Whatever that means.

992
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,409
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.

993
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,583
I played Ping-Pong so much,

994
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:56,482
I even played it in my sleep.

995
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:04,529
Now...

996
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:06,033
you listen to me.

997
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:08,036
We all have a destiny.

998
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:11,543
Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!

999
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:14,604
I should have died out there with my men,

1000
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:18,676
but now...I'm nothing but a god damn cripple,

1001
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:20,449
a legless freak!

1002
01:00:20,526 --> 01:00:22,616
Look. Look! Look at me!

1003
01:00:22,697 --> 01:00:24,127
You see that?

1004
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,062
Do you know what it's like

1005
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:29,125
not to be able to use your legs?

1006
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,198
Y-Y -Yes, sir, I do.

1007
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:39,413
Did you hear what I said?

1008
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:41,351
You cheated me!

1009
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:42,855
I had a destiny .

1010
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:45,450
I was supposed to die in the field

1011
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,722
with honor!

1012
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,525
That was my destiny,

1013
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:51,568
and you... cheated me out of it!

1014
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,483
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

1015
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,051
This wasn't supposed to happen...

1016
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,926
Not to me.

1017
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,992
I had a destiny.

1018
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:16,567
I was...

1019
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:18,404
Lieutenant...

1020
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,207
Dan Taylor.

1021
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,020
Y-You still

1022
01:01:27,093 --> 01:01:28,751
Lieutenant Dan.

1023
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:52,559
Look at me.

1024
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:56,566
What am I going to do now?

1025
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:01,936
What am I going to do now?

1026
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,286
PFC Gump?

1027
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,892
Yes, sir!

1028
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:18,364
As you were.

1029
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:20,592
Son,

1030
01:02:20,673 --> 01:02:23,131
you been awarded the Medal of Honor.

1031
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:25,496
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?

1032
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:28,298
They want to give me a med...

1033
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,014
Ma'am.

1034
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:38,520
What did they do with Lieutenant Dan?

1035
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,452
They sent him home.

1036
01:02:47,102 --> 01:02:50,469
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

1037
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:52,030
The ceremony was kicked off

1038
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,201
with a can did speech by the president

1039
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:58,718
regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam.

1040
01:02:58,786 --> 01:03:02,719
Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to men from each of the armed services.

1041
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:04,690
America owes you a debt of gratitude, son.

1042
01:03:06,633 --> 01:03:08,563
I understand you were wounded.

1043
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,564
Where were you hit?

1044
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:12,229
In the but-tocks, sir.

1045
01:03:12,307 --> 01:03:14,237
Well, that must be a sight.

1046
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,071
I'd kinda like to see that.

1047
01:03:17,149 --> 01:03:20,913
# And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson #

1048
01:03:20,988 --> 01:03:24,046
#Jesus loves you more than you will know #

1049
01:03:27,697 --> 01:03:31,029
# God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson #

1050
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32,761
God damn, son!

1051
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:38,043
After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

1052
01:03:38,113 --> 01:03:42,046
so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.

1053
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,049
Hilary! I got the vets.

1054
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:46,917
What do you want to do with them?

1055
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:49,500
It's a good thing Mama was resting,

1056
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,000
'cause the streets was awful crowded with people

1057
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,563
lookin'at all the statues and monuments,

1058
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,571
and some of them people were loud and pushy.

1059
01:03:58,578 --> 01:04:00,166
O.K., follow me!

1060
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:03,540
Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line.

1061
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:11,409
Come on.

1062
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,474
Go!

1063
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:24,738
Hey, you're a good man for doing this.

1064
01:04:24,738 --> 01:04:26,100
Good.

1065
01:04:26,438 --> 01:04:27,926
O.K.

1066
01:04:29,138 --> 01:04:31,770
There was this man giving a little talk.

1067
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:33,213
And for some reason,

1068
01:04:33,646 --> 01:04:35,578
he was wearing an American flag for a shirt.

1069
01:04:37,151 --> 01:04:41,084
And he liked to say the "F" word...a lot.

1070
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,419
"F" this and "F" that.

1071
01:04:43,494 --> 01:04:46,460
And every time he said the "F" word,

1072
01:04:46,532 --> 01:04:49,590
people, for some reason, well, they cheered.

1073
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:53,831
Yeah! Yeah!

1074
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:58,369
Come on, man. Come up here, man.

1075
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:00,200
Come on. Come on.

1076
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,434
Yeah, you! Come on. Move, move !

1077
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,043
Go on. Let's get up there .

1078
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,600
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

1079
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,440
The war in Vietnam?

1080
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:25,001
The war in Viet...

1081
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,600
fucking-nam!

1082
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:53,416
Well...

1083
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:56,421
There was only one thing I could say

1084
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:57,925
about the war in Vietnam.

1085
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:00,928
There's only one thing I can say about...

1086
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,488
the war in Vietnam.

1087
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,869
In Vietnam...

1088
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:20,958
What the hell are you do...

1089
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:23,963
I'll beat your head in, you goddamn oinker!

1090
01:06:24,035 --> 01:06:26,468
Jesus Christ! What did they do with this?

1091
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,504
Can't hear you!

1092
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:32,406
Can't hear anything!

1093
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:34,411
This...This one!

1094
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:35,412
Give me that!

1095
01:06:35,485 --> 01:06:38,043
Speak up!

1096
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:41,623
And that's all I have to say

1097
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,223
about that.

1098
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,166
That's so right on, man.

1099
01:06:51,244 --> 01:06:52,709
You said it all.

1100
01:06:54,247 --> 01:06:56,406
What's your name, man?

1101
01:06:56,485 --> 01:06:59,920
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

1102
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:02,179
Forrest Gump.

1103
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:02,886
- Gump! Gump! - Gump!

1104
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:06,463
Forrest!

1105
01:07:07,538 --> 01:07:08,969
Forrest!

1106
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,224
Jenny !

1107
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:15,286
Forrest!

1108
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:45,998
It was the happiest moment of my life.

1109
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,451
Jenny and me were just like peas and carrots again.

1110
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:54,833
She showed me around

1111
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,896
and even in troduced me to some of her new friends.

1112
01:07:57,969 --> 01:07:59,430
Shut that blind, man!

1113
01:07:59,505 --> 01:08:01,504
And get your white ass away from that window .

1114
01:08:01,603 --> 01:08:03,647
Don't you know we in a war here?

1115
01:08:04,523 --> 01:08:06,123
He's cool. He's one of us.

1116
01:08:06,423 --> 01:08:08,398
Let me tell you about us.

1117
01:08:08,723 --> 01:08:10,173
Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders

1118
01:08:10,523 --> 01:08:11,623
from the racial on slaught of the pig

1119
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:14,618
who wishes to brutalize our black leaders ,

1120
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:17,780
rape our women, and destroy our black communities.

1121
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:22,286
Who's the baby killer?

1122
01:08:22,363 --> 01:08:23,943
This is my good friend I told you about.

1123
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:27,005
This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley .

1124
01:08:27,075 --> 01:08:29,789
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley ,

1125
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:32,761
and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

1126
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:35,351
We are here to offer protection and help

1127
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,500
for all those who need our help,

1128
01:08:37,562 --> 01:08:38,790
because we, the Black Panthers ,

1129
01:08:38,851 --> 01:08:41,749
are against the war in Vietnam.

1130
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:43,357
We are against any war

1131
01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:45,066
where black soldiers are sent to the front line

1132
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:46,846
to die for a country that hates them.

1133
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,953
We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight

1134
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:51,523
and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities.

1135
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:57,737
We are against these racist and imperial acts...

1136
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,970
# And I gave her the gun #

1137
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:06,089
# I shot her #

1138
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:10,516
Forrest!

1139
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,506
Stop it!

1140
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,680
Stop it!

1141
01:09:13,493 --> 01:09:14,558
Forrest!

1142
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,021
Stop it! Stop it!

1143
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:28,269
I shouldn't have brought you here .

1144
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:33,038
I should have known it was going to be some bullshit hassle!

1145
01:09:33,113 --> 01:09:35,670
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

1146
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:42,684
Come on, Forrest.

1147
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:52,514
Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party .

1148
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:57,240
He doesn't mean it when he does things like this.

1149
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,776
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

1150
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:03,650
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

1151
01:10:05,724 --> 01:10:08,417
I wanted to be your boy friend.

1152
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,069
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

1153
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,780
You look handsome in it.

1154
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:26,582
You do.

1155
01:10:29,862 --> 01:10:31,292
You know what?

1156
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:32,451
What?

1157
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:39,201
I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.

1158
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,300
Me, too, Forrest.

1159
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,837
We walked around all night, Jenny and me,

1160
01:10:45,918 --> 01:10:47,849
just talkin'.

1161
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:52,687
She told me about all the traveling she'd done

1162
01:10:52,763 --> 01:10:56,629
and how she discovered ways to expand her mind

1163
01:10:56,703 --> 01:11:00,255
and learn how to live in harmony...

1164
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:02,288
which must be out west somewhere,

1165
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,293
'cause she made it all the way to California.

1166
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,296
# Love one another right now #

1167
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:11,667
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

1168
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,207
I'll go.

1169
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:14,606
Far out!

1170
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:17,111
It was a very special night

1171
01:11:17,185 --> 01:11:18,878
for the two of us.

1172
01:11:20,589 --> 01:11:22,520
I didn't want it to end.

1173
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,555
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

1174
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:28,352
I have to, Forrest.

1175
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:30,762
Jenny?

1176
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:35,265
Things got a little out of hand.

1177
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:36,934
It's just this war

1178
01:11:37,012 --> 01:11:39,772
and that lying son of a bitch Johnson and...

1179
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:44,050
I would never hurt you. You know that.

1180
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:48,758
Know what I think?

1181
01:11:50,768 --> 01:11:52,198
I think...

1182
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,293
you should go home to Greenbow ,

1183
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,361
Alabama!

1184
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:07,755
Forrest,

1185
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:11,520
we have very different lives, you know.

1186
01:12:20,413 --> 01:12:22,344
I want you...

1187
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,507
to have this.

1188
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,348
Forrest, I can't keep this.

1189
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:33,794
I got it...

1190
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:37,199
just by doing what you told me to do.

1191
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:42,140
Why are you so good to me?

1192
01:12:42,213 --> 01:12:44,041
You're my girl.

1193
01:12:46,186 --> 01:12:47,879
I'll always be your girl.

1194
01:13:10,824 --> 01:13:15,783
# To everything, turn, turn, turn #

1195
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:20,360
# There is a season, turn, turn, turn #

1196
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,204
# And a time to every purpose #

1197
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:26,300
# Under heaven #

1198
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,316
And just like that,

1199
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:35,426
she was gone out of my life again.

1200
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,950
That's one small step for man,

1201
01:13:39,543 --> 01:13:41,983
one giant leap for mankind.

1202
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:49,161
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

1203
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,907
but instead they decided

1204
01:13:51,919 --> 01:13:54,121
the best way for me to fight the Communists

1205
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:56,075
was to play Ping-Pong,

1206
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:58,299
so I was in the special Services,

1207
01:13:58,328 --> 01:13:59,832
traveling around the country,

1208
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:02,579
cheering up wounded veterans and showing'em

1209
01:14:02,635 --> 01:14:03,975
how to play Ping-Pong.

1210
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:05,217
I was so good that some years later,

1211
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:07,297
the army decided I should be

1212
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:09,659
on the all-American Ping-Pong team.

1213
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:13,197
We were the first Americans to visit the land of China

1214
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:15,813
in a million years or something.

1215
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:18,997
Somebody said world peace was in our hands,

1216
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:21,923
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

1217
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:25,037
When I got home, I was a national celebrity ,

1218
01:14:25,113 --> 01:14:27,010
famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

1219
01:14:28,049 --> 01:14:29,980
Here he is, Forrest Gump.

1220
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:31,415
Right here.

1221
01:14:37,259 --> 01:14:40,227
Gump, have a seat.

1222
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:43,058
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

1223
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:45,064
Welcome home.

1224
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:47,065
Can you tell us, um,

1225
01:14:47,137 --> 01:14:49,261
what was China like?

1226
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:54,566
In the land of China...

1227
01:14:54,648 --> 01:14:56,579
people hardly got nothin'at all.

1228
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,807
No possessions?

1229
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:06,087
And in China, they never go to church.

1230
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,592
No religion, too?

1231
01:15:09,665 --> 01:15:11,254
Hard to imagine.

1232
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,596
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

1233
01:15:14,672 --> 01:15:16,103
Some years later,

1234
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:18,104
that nice young man from England

1235
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:21,143
was on his way home to see his little boy

1236
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:23,110
and was signing some autographs.

1237
01:15:23,181 --> 01:15:25,043
For no particular reason at all,

1238
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:27,583
Somebody shot him.

1239
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,055
They gave you...

1240
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:34,115
the congressional Medal of Honor.

1241
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,324
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

1242
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:41,857
Lieutenant Dan!

1243
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,800
They gave you...

1244
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,898
the congressional Medal of Honor.

1245
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:50,076
Yes, sir. They surely did.

1246
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:51,975
They gave you,

1247
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,569
an imbecile,

1248
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:55,582
a moron who goes on television

1249
01:15:55,653 --> 01:15:58,084
and makes a fool out of himself

1250
01:15:58,157 --> 01:16:01,125
in front of the whole damn country,

1251
01:16:01,193 --> 01:16:03,522
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1252
01:16:04,966 --> 01:16:05,895
Yes, sir.

1253
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:11,399
Well...that... that's just perfect!

1254
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:15,166
Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that...

1255
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:17,607
Goddamn bless America.

1256
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:23,943
Oh, God, whoa!

1257
01:16:24,022 --> 01:16:26,784
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!

1258
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:28,482
Lieutenant Dan!

1259
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,551
Lieutenant Dan said he was living in a hotel

1260
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,563
and because he didn't have no legs,

1261
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,567
he spent most of his time exercising his arms.

1262
01:16:39,674 --> 01:16:41,571
Make a right. Take a right!

1263
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:50,575
What do you do here in New York, Lieutenant Dan?

1264
01:16:50,653 --> 01:16:53,084
I'm living off the government tit.

1265
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:58,583
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?

1266
01:16:58,663 --> 01:17:00,094
I'm walking here!

1267
01:17:00,165 --> 01:17:01,596
Ah, get out!

1268
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:03,324
Come on. Go, go, go!

1269
01:17:09,009 --> 01:17:11,099
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan

1270
01:17:11,178 --> 01:17:13,507
and celebrated the holidays.

1271
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:20,179
You have a great year, and hurry home.

1272
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,947
God bless you.

1273
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:27,319
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

1274
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:32,630
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for Him, sir.

1275
01:17:38,645 --> 01:17:42,101
That's all these cripples down at the V. A....

1276
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:45,581
That's all they ever talk about.

1277
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:49,884
Jesus this and Jesus that. Ha.

1278
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:53,447
Have I...found Jesus?

1279
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:56,963
They even had a priest come and talk to me.

1280
01:17:57,032 --> 01:17:59,588
He said God is listening,

1281
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:02,603
but I have to help myself.

1282
01:18:02,674 --> 01:18:05,608
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

1283
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:10,112
I'll get to walk beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.

1284
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:12,408
Did you hear what I said?

1285
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:15,482
Walk...

1286
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:18,110
beside Him in the kingdom of heaven.

1287
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:20,622
Well...kiss my crippled ass.

1288
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:22,626
God is listening?

1289
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,754
What a crock of shit.

1290
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:30,192
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

1291
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,639
Oh?

1292
01:18:38,217 --> 01:18:39,442
Well...

1293
01:18:42,053 --> 01:18:43,574
before you go... why don't you

1294
01:18:43,656 --> 01:18:46,074
get your ass down to the corner

1295
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,868
and get us more Ripple?

1296
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:48,966
Yes, sir.

1297
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:50,478
We're at approximately

1298
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:53,641
45th Street in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1299
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,651
This is the site of the old...

1300
01:18:55,723 --> 01:18:58,154
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre ?

1301
01:18:58,224 --> 01:18:59,655
Shrimping boats.

1302
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:03,162
Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?

1303
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:05,162
I got to buy me one

1304
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,165
soon as I have some money .

1305
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:08,668
I promised Bubba in Vietnam

1306
01:19:08,737 --> 01:19:12,171
that as soon as the war was over, we'd be partners.

1307
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:15,675
He'd be the captain and I'd be his first mate.

1308
01:19:15,747 --> 01:19:18,681
But now that he's dead, I got to be the captain.

1309
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,681
A shrimp boat captain.

1310
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:23,845
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1311
01:19:26,192 --> 01:19:28,123
Now hear this!

1312
01:19:28,193 --> 01:19:29,624
Private Gump here

1313
01:19:29,697 --> 01:19:32,128
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1314
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,131
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.

1315
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,136
The day that you are a shrimp boat captain,

1316
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,139
I will come and be your first mate.

1317
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,644
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,

1318
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,644
that's the day I'm an astronaut!

1319
01:19:46,717 --> 01:19:48,648
Danny, what are you complaining about?

1320
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,150
Danny, how you doing, huh?

1321
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,650
Mr. Hot Wheels!

1322
01:19:51,722 --> 01:19:53,153
Who's your friend?

1323
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:55,690
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

1324
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:58,192
This is cunning Carla

1325
01:19:58,262 --> 01:20:00,193
and long-limbs Lenore .

1326
01:20:00,266 --> 01:20:02,163
So where you been, baby cakes, huh?

1327
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:04,166
Haven't seen you around lately.

1328
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:06,669
You should have been here for Christmas,

1329
01:20:06,742 --> 01:20:08,673
'cause Tommy bought a free round

1330
01:20:08,742 --> 01:20:10,673
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1331
01:20:10,746 --> 01:20:12,677
Well, well, I had, uh... company .

1332
01:20:12,748 --> 01:20:14,679
Hey! Hey, we was just there!

1333
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,681
That's like Times Square .

1334
01:20:16,752 --> 01:20:19,183
Don't you just love New Year's?

1335
01:20:19,255 --> 01:20:21,686
You can start all over.

1336
01:20:21,759 --> 01:20:23,690
Everybody gets a second chance.

1337
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:25,125
It's funny...

1338
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:28,129
but in the middle of all that fun,

1339
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,027
I began to think about Jenny,

1340
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:33,535
wondering how she was spending her New Year's night

1341
01:20:33,607 --> 01:20:36,266
out in California.

1342
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:39,640
# Don't you love her ways? #

1343
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:42,805
# Tell me what you say #

1344
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:45,974
# Don't you love her madly? #

1345
01:20:46,055 --> 01:20:49,147
# Want to meet her daddy? #

1346
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:52,283
# Don't you love her face? #

1347
01:20:52,363 --> 01:20:57,161
# Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door? #

1348
01:20:57,234 --> 01:20:58,665
9...8...

1349
01:20:58,737 --> 01:21:00,668
7...6...

1350
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:02,670
5...4...

1351
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,205
3...2...

1352
01:21:04,278 --> 01:21:05,207
1!

1353
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,469
Happy new year!

1354
01:21:17,258 --> 01:21:21,192
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot #

1355
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:24,199
# And never brought to mind? #

1356
01:21:24,268 --> 01:21:27,133
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!

1357
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:31,899
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot #

1358
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:36,933
# In days of auld lang syne! #

1359
01:21:45,992 --> 01:21:47,547
# Together we stand #

1360
01:21:47,629 --> 01:21:50,288
# Divided we fall #

1361
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,454
# Come on now, people, let's #

1362
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:53,463
# Get on the ball #

1363
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:55,762
# And work together #

1364
01:21:55,838 --> 01:21:57,564
# Come on, come on #

1365
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,298
# Let's work together #

1366
01:22:01,745 --> 01:22:04,176
Oh! What are you, stupid or something?

1367
01:22:04,248 --> 01:22:05,679
What's your problem?

1368
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,181
What's his problem?

1369
01:22:07,253 --> 01:22:10,187
Did you lose your packet in the war or something?

1370
01:22:10,256 --> 01:22:12,187
Is your friend stupid or something?

1371
01:22:12,258 --> 01:22:13,689
What did you say?

1372
01:22:13,759 --> 01:22:16,190
I said is your friend stupid or something?

1373
01:22:16,263 --> 01:22:17,522
Don't call him stupid!

1374
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:19,028
Hey, don't push her!

1375
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,121
You shut up!

1376
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,097
Don't you ever call him stupid!

1377
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,499
Come on, baby, why you being so upset, huh?

1378
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:25,730
Get your goddamned clothes

1379
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:28,239
and get the hell out of here!

1380
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,138
You should be in a sideshow.

1381
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:31,335
You're so pathetic!

1382
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,901
Get out of here!

1383
01:22:32,984 --> 01:22:34,415
You big guy!

1384
01:22:34,484 --> 01:22:36,450
Loser. You freak!

1385
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:42,884
Oh, no. No.

1386
01:23:07,759 --> 01:23:09,187
I'm sorry I ruined

1387
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:12,186
your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1388
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,581
She tastes like cigarettes.

1389
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:32,607
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

1390
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:35,608
there's some things you just can't change.

1391
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,607
He didn't want to be called crippled

1392
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:42,103
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1393
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:48,293
Happy new year, Gump.

1394
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:54,587
The U.S. Ping-Pong team

1395
01:23:54,668 --> 01:23:56,096
met with President Nixon today...

1396
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,788
Wouldn't you know it?

1397
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,589
A few months later,

1398
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:02,595
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team

1399
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,091
to visit the White House.

1400
01:24:04,163 --> 01:24:05,557
So I went...

1401
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:06,784
again.

1402
01:24:06,862 --> 01:24:10,653
And I met the president of the United States again.

1403
01:24:10,727 --> 01:24:13,279
Only this time, they didn't get us rooms

1404
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:15,082
in a real fancy hotel.

1405
01:24:15,157 --> 01:24:16,585
Are you enjoying yourself

1406
01:24:16,656 --> 01:24:18,584
in our nation's capital, young man?

1407
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:20,084
where are you staying?

1408
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,584
It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

1409
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:24,584
Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

1410
01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:26,012
It's brand-new. Very modern.

1411
01:24:26,087 --> 01:24:28,707
I'll have my people take care of it.

1412
01:24:28,784 --> 01:24:30,007
Security.

1413
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:31,512
Yeah. Sir,

1414
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:34,514
you might want to send a maintenance man

1415
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:37,009
over to that office across the way .

1416
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,507
The lights are off

1417
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,510
and they must be looking for a fuse box ,

1418
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,508
'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake .

1419
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:46,504
O.K., sir. I'll check it out.

1420
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:47,867
Thank you. Good night.

1421
01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:52,502
Therefore...

1422
01:24:52,573 --> 01:24:54,501
I shall resign the presidency

1423
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:56,829
effective at noon tomorrow.

1424
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:58,832
Vice President Ford

1425
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:00,990
will be sworn in as president

1426
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:03,723
at that hour in this office.

1427
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,291
Forrest Gump.

1428
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:17,983
Yes, sir!

1429
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,488
As you were.

1430
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,488
I have your discharge papers.

1431
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:23,212
Service is up, son.

1432
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,781
Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1433
01:25:28,854 --> 01:25:30,817
For the army, it does.

1434
01:25:32,986 --> 01:25:34,914
And just like that,

1435
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:38,413
my service in the United States Army was over.

1436
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,943
So I went home.

1437
01:26:06,603 --> 01:26:08,122
I'm home, Mama.

1438
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,596
I know. I know .

1439
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,394
Louise, he's here .

1440
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:16,396
Now, when I got home, I had no idea,

1441
01:26:16,465 --> 01:26:18,892
but Mama had all sorts of visitors.

1442
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:20,892
We've had all sorts of visitors .

1443
01:26:20,963 --> 01:26:24,391
Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1444
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,320
One man even left a check for $25,000

1445
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:30,821
if you'd be agree able to saying you like using their paddle.

1446
01:26:30,892 --> 01:26:33,822
I only like using my own paddle.

1447
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,284
Hi, Miss Louise.

1448
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,342
Hey, Forrest.

1449
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:39,317
I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1450
01:26:39,387 --> 01:26:42,815
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,

1451
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:45,312
see if it grows on you.

1452
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:47,313
That Mama, she sure was right.

1453
01:26:47,384 --> 01:26:50,071
It's funny how things work out.

1454
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,102
I didn't stay home for long

1455
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,600
because I'd made apromise to Bubba,

1456
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:57,099
and I always try to keep my promise,

1457
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,598
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1458
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,155
to meet Bubba's family.

1459
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:05,627
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?

1460
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:08,924
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1461
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:09,926
I guess.

1462
01:27:09,998 --> 01:27:11,426
And, of course,

1463
01:27:11,497 --> 01:27:14,584
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1464
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:18,482
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

1465
01:27:21,826 --> 01:27:23,754
I remember everything you said,

1466
01:27:23,825 --> 01:27:26,685
and I got it all figured out.

1467
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:34,975
I'm taking $24,562.47

1468
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:37,173
that I got, that's left

1469
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,679
after a new hair cut and a new suit

1470
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,680
and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,

1471
01:27:42,748 --> 01:27:45,608
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.

1472
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,666
Tell me something.

1473
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:50,173
Are you stupid or something?

1474
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:52,933
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1475
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:54,939
That's what's left after me saying,

1476
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,938
"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1477
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,935
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong

1478
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:03,128
with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"

1479
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:05,132
which everybody knows isn't true,

1480
01:28:05,203 --> 01:28:08,133
but Mama said it was just a little white lie,

1481
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:10,130
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1482
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,629
So anyway, I'm putting all that

1483
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:15,128
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1484
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,130
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1485
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,650
Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,

1486
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:45,648
but you know what I found out?

1487
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:49,270
Shrimping is tough.

1488
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,869
I only caught five .

1489
01:28:53,946 --> 01:28:57,374
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.

1490
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,140
Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?

1491
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:05,139
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.

1492
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,634
I'd never named a boat before,

1493
01:29:07,706 --> 01:29:12,724
but there was only one I could think of,

1494
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:16,755
the most beautiful name in the wide world.

1495
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:22,319
# Do a little dance #

1496
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,362
# Make a little love #

1497
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,359
# Get down tonight#

1498
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,721
# Get down tonight#

1499
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:30,985
# Do a little dance #

1500
01:29:31,062 --> 01:29:32,819
# Make a little love #

1501
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:34,517
# Get down tonight#

1502
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,052
# Get down tonight... #

1503
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,518
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1504
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:40,882
in a long while,

1505
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:43,384
but I thought about her a lot.

1506
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:46,544
I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.

1507
01:29:46,623 --> 01:29:51,641
# Oh, and the bird you cannot change #

1508
01:29:55,084 --> 01:30:01,771
# And this bird you cannot change #

1509
01:30:01,848 --> 01:30:09,217
# Lord knows I can't change #

1510
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:16,220
# Lord, help me, I can't change #

1511
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:35,874
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1512
01:32:25,424 --> 01:32:30,020
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1513
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:33,462
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1514
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:36,468
Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

1515
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:37,969
Yes, I know that.

1516
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:42,236
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1517
01:32:42,309 --> 01:32:44,675
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.

1518
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:47,613
I had to see this for myself...

1519
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:50,384
and...

1520
01:32:50,453 --> 01:32:54,890
I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,

1521
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:56,891
that I'd be your first mate.

1522
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,621
Well, here I am.

1523
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:00,629
I'm a man of my word .

1524
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:01,721
O.K.

1525
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:03,960
But don't you be thinking

1526
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,469
that I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1527
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:07,469
No, sir.

1528
01:33:16,016 --> 01:33:17,540
It's my boat.

1529
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:24,817
I have a feeling if we head due east,

1530
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:28,453
we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.

1531
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:31,298
Take a left!

1532
01:33:31,366 --> 01:33:32,298
Which way?

1533
01:33:32,368 --> 01:33:33,300
Over there!

1534
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:34,802
They're over there!

1535
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:38,204
Get on the wheel and take a left.

1536
01:33:38,275 --> 01:33:39,708
O.K.

1537
01:33:41,045 --> 01:33:42,979
Gump, what are you doing?

1538
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:44,480
Take a left!

1539
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:45,538
Left!

1540
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:51,355
That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!

1541
01:33:52,425 --> 01:33:54,552
That's where we'll find them.

1542
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,908
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1543
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,911
O.K., so I was wrong.

1544
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:13,914
Well, how are we going to find them?

1545
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:18,010
Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.

1546
01:34:18,088 --> 01:34:20,750
# So pray that #

1547
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:24,090
# I'm homeward bound... #

1548
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:26,857
So I went to church every Sunday.

1549
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,234
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1550
01:34:30,302 --> 01:34:34,170
though I think he left the praying up to me.

1551
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,089
No shrimp.

1552
01:34:51,193 --> 01:34:54,128
Where the hell's this God of yours?

1553
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:56,630
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1554
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,517
'cause right then God showed up.

1555
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,603
You'll never sink this boat!

1556
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,333
Now, me, I was scared,

1557
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:25,469
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1558
01:35:25,546 --> 01:35:26,535
Come on!

1559
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,381
You call this a storm?

1560
01:35:31,453 --> 01:35:35,389
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1561
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,394
It's time for a show down!

1562
01:35:39,463 --> 01:35:40,930
You and me!

1563
01:35:40,997 --> 01:35:44,057
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1564
01:35:46,737 --> 01:35:48,170
You'll never sink...

1565
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,536
this...

1566
01:35:49,607 --> 01:35:50,699
boat!

1567
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:54,873
Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,

1568
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:56,803
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1569
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,811
And as in other towns up and down the coast,

1570
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,677
Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry

1571
01:36:02,749 --> 01:36:05,081
has fallen victim to Carmen

1572
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:07,985
and has been left in utter ruin.

1573
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,487
This reporter has learned,

1574
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:11,991
in fact, only one shrimping boat

1575
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:13,583
actually survived the storm.

1576
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:16,129
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1577
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:19,292
After that, shrimping was easy.

1578
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:22,132
# There will be great bounty #

1579
01:36:22,205 --> 01:36:24,867
# Oh, my God... #

1580
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,875
Since people still needed them shrimps

1581
01:36:26,944 --> 01:36:29,310
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all

1582
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,315
and we were the only boat left standing,

1583
01:36:32,383 --> 01:36:34,817
Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got.

1584
01:36:34,886 --> 01:36:37,821
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1585
01:36:37,889 --> 01:36:39,823
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

1586
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,826
We even have hats

1587
01:36:41,894 --> 01:36:44,328
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1588
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:45,830
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1589
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:47,332
It's a household name.

1590
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,062
Hold on there, boy.

1591
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,570
Are you telling me you're the owner

1592
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,869
of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1593
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:56,877
Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.

1594
01:36:56,946 --> 01:36:59,881
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,

1595
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:02,884
but that tops them all.

1596
01:37:04,988 --> 01:37:08,389
We were sitting next to a millionaire .

1597
01:37:11,395 --> 01:37:16,389
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1598
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:19,528
and you tell it so well,

1599
01:37:19,605 --> 01:37:21,698
with such enthusiasm.

1600
01:37:21,774 --> 01:37:25,870
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1601
01:37:25,945 --> 01:37:28,175
Yes, I would.

1602
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:34,080
That's him right there .

1603
01:37:36,324 --> 01:37:39,384
Let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.

1604
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:40,952
Forrest...

1605
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:50,266
I never thanked you for saving my life .

1606
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,904
He never actually said so,

1607
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:22,342
but I think he made his peace with God.

1608
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,917
For the second time in 17 days,

1609
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,423
President Ford escaped possible assassination today.

1610
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,427
Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.

1611
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:38,928
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1612
01:38:38,998 --> 01:38:40,932
Forrest has a phone call.

1613
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,437
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.

1614
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:47,939
He is indisposed at the moment.

1615
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,475
His mama's sick.

1616
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:09,497
Where's Mama?

1617
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:11,364
She's upstairs .

1618
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,533
Hi, Forrest.

1619
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,802
I'll see you tomorrow .

1620
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:19,173
Oh, all right.

1621
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:28,384
Sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?

1622
01:39:40,569 --> 01:39:42,059
What's the matter, Mama?

1623
01:39:42,138 --> 01:39:45,301
I'm dying, Forrest.

1624
01:39:47,444 --> 01:39:50,345
Come on in, sit down over here .

1625
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,191
Why are you dying, Mama?

1626
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:08,359
It's my time.

1627
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:11,495
It's just my time.

1628
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:13,597
Oh, now...

1629
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,235
don't you be afraid, sweet heart .

1630
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:20,713
Death is just a part of life .

1631
01:40:20,782 --> 01:40:24,741
Something we're all destined to do.

1632
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:27,153
I didn't know it,

1633
01:40:27,223 --> 01:40:30,158
but I was destined to be your mama.

1634
01:40:30,227 --> 01:40:32,957
I did the best I could.

1635
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,964
You did good.

1636
01:40:35,033 --> 01:40:41,303
Well...I happen to believe you make your own destiny .

1637
01:40:41,373 --> 01:40:45,901
You have to do the best with what God gave you.

1638
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,010
What's my destiny, Mama?

1639
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:56,523
You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.

1640
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,795
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1641
01:41:00,863 --> 01:41:03,798
You never know what you're going to get.

1642
01:41:03,867 --> 01:41:06,802
Mama always hada way of explaining things

1643
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:08,804
so I could understand them.

1644
01:41:08,872 --> 01:41:10,339
I will miss you, Forrest.

1645
01:41:12,076 --> 01:41:14,340
She had got the cancer

1646
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,345
and died on a Tuesday.

1647
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:19,008
I bought her a new hat

1648
01:41:19,084 --> 01:41:21,109
with little flowers on it.

1649
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:26,752
And that's all I have to say about that.

1650
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:36,731
Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?

1651
01:41:36,804 --> 01:41:39,534
There'll be another one along shortly.

1652
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:47,482
Now, because I had been a football star and war hero

1653
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:50,486
and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain

1654
01:41:50,554 --> 01:41:51,987
and a college graduate,

1655
01:41:52,056 --> 01:41:54,490
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1656
01:41:54,559 --> 01:41:57,050
decided to get together and offered me a fine job.

1657
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:02,091
So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1658
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:05,102
though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.

1659
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:08,106
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.

1660
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:10,608
So then I got a call from him

1661
01:42:10,678 --> 01:42:13,238
saying we don't have to worry about money no more,

1662
01:42:13,314 --> 01:42:17,717
and I said, "That's good. One less thing."

1663
01:42:17,786 --> 01:42:19,583
# I've got a new hope... #

1664
01:42:19,654 --> 01:42:22,088
Now Mama said there's only so much fortune

1665
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:23,785
a man really needs,

1666
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:27,260
and the rest is just for showing off.

1667
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,231
So I gave a whole bunch of it

1668
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,565
to the Four square Gospel Church...

1669
01:42:33,637 --> 01:42:38,700
and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1670
01:42:40,179 --> 01:42:42,613
and even though Bubba was dead

1671
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:46,117
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1672
01:42:46,186 --> 01:42:48,916
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1673
01:42:52,293 --> 01:42:53,954
You know what?

1674
01:42:54,028 --> 01:42:57,964
She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.

1675
01:42:58,032 --> 01:43:00,626
That smells wonderful.

1676
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:03,136
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1677
01:43:03,205 --> 01:43:06,140
and I liked doing it so much,

1678
01:43:06,209 --> 01:43:09,645
I cut that grass for free.

1679
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:14,517
But at night time when there was nothing to do

1680
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:17,019
and the house was all empty,

1681
01:43:17,088 --> 01:43:20,023
I'd always think of Jenny.

1682
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:27,339
And then...she was there.

1683
01:45:00,114 --> 01:45:01,411
Hello, Forrest.

1684
01:45:01,483 --> 01:45:03,678
Hello, Jenny .

1685
01:45:14,531 --> 01:45:17,659
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1686
01:45:17,735 --> 01:45:22,570
Maybe it was because she had no where else to go,

1687
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,007
or maybe it was because she was so tired

1688
01:45:26,078 --> 01:45:29,514
'cause she went to bed and slept and slept

1689
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:31,812
like she hadn't slept in years.

1690
01:45:31,885 --> 01:45:34,251
It was wonderful having her home.

1691
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,754
Every day we'd take a walk,

1692
01:45:36,824 --> 01:45:40,760
and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1693
01:45:40,829 --> 01:45:43,764
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1694
01:45:43,832 --> 01:45:46,767
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.

1695
01:45:46,836 --> 01:45:48,770
I did all the talking.

1696
01:45:48,838 --> 01:45:51,329
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1697
01:46:30,987 --> 01:46:33,717
How could you do this?

1698
01:47:11,033 --> 01:47:15,527
Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.

1699
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,975
I never really knew why she came back,

1700
01:47:20,044 --> 01:47:21,477
but I didn't care.

1701
01:47:21,545 --> 01:47:23,479
It was like olden times.

1702
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:26,346
We was like peas and carrots again.

1703
01:47:27,986 --> 01:47:30,420
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers

1704
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:34,051
and put them in her room for her,

1705
01:47:34,127 --> 01:47:37,563
and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get

1706
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:39,064
in the wide world.

1707
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:41,658
They're made just for running.

1708
01:47:41,736 --> 01:47:42,998
# Carry me home to see my kin #

1709
01:47:45,674 --> 01:47:48,199
And she even showed me how to dance.

1710
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,412
#I miss ol'Bammy once again #

1711
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:53,709
#And I think it's a sin #

1712
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:56,646
# Sweet home Alabama... #

1713
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,748
Well, we was like family, Jenny and me...

1714
01:48:04,662 --> 01:48:07,859
and it was the happiest time in my life.

1715
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:33,494
You done watching it?

1716
01:48:34,564 --> 01:48:36,555
I'm going to bed.

1717
01:48:47,447 --> 01:48:49,005
Will you marry me?

1718
01:48:54,056 --> 01:48:57,025
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1719
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:01,461
You would, Forrest.

1720
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,663
But you won't marry me.

1721
01:49:08,072 --> 01:49:10,472
You don't want to marry me.

1722
01:49:13,578 --> 01:49:15,978
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1723
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:23,354
I'm not a smart man,

1724
01:49:23,422 --> 01:49:27,882
but I know what love is.

1725
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:06,066
Jenny...

1726
01:50:08,142 --> 01:50:10,440
Forrest, I do love you.

1727
01:51:03,472 --> 01:51:06,066
Where are you running off to?

1728
01:51:06,143 --> 01:51:07,701
I'm not running.

1729
01:52:38,135 --> 01:52:40,103
That day,

1730
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,603
for no particular reason,

1731
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,664
I decided to go for a little run.

1732
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,199
So I ran to the end of the road,

1733
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:51,612
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1734
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:54,311
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...

1735
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:56,376
And when I got there,

1736
01:52:56,454 --> 01:53:00,390
I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.

1737
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:02,893
Now, I figured since I'd run this far,

1738
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:06,829
maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.

1739
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:08,833
And that's what I did.

1740
01:53:08,902 --> 01:53:10,893
I ran clear across Alabama.

1741
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:15,498
No particular reason. I just kept on going.

1742
01:53:15,575 --> 01:53:17,509
I ran clear to the ocean.

1743
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,342
And when I got there,

1744
01:53:24,418 --> 01:53:26,852
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1745
01:53:26,921 --> 01:53:30,084
might as well turn around, just keep on going.

1746
01:53:32,127 --> 01:53:35,187
And when I got to another ocean,

1747
01:53:35,263 --> 01:53:38,198
I figured since I'd gone this far...

1748
01:53:40,103 --> 01:53:42,401
I might as well just turn back

1749
01:53:42,472 --> 01:53:44,064
and keep right on going.

1750
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:47,473
when I got tired, I slept.

1751
01:53:47,544 --> 01:53:49,637
when I got hungry, I ate.

1752
01:53:49,713 --> 01:53:52,147
When I had to go...

1753
01:53:52,216 --> 01:53:53,240
you know...

1754
01:53:54,385 --> 01:53:55,545
I went.

1755
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:56,813
And so...

1756
01:53:56,888 --> 01:53:58,913
you just ran?

1757
01:54:00,558 --> 01:54:02,116
Yeah.

1758
01:54:02,193 --> 01:54:05,890
# Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels #

1759
01:54:09,068 --> 01:54:11,935
# Lookin' back at the years gone by #

1760
01:54:12,004 --> 01:54:14,302
# Like so many summer fields #

1761
01:54:15,909 --> 01:54:19,140
# In '65, I was 17 #

1762
01:54:19,212 --> 01:54:21,646
# And runnin' up one on one #

1763
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:25,677
# I don't know where I'm runnin' now #

1764
01:54:25,753 --> 01:54:28,847
# I'm just runnin' on #

1765
01:54:28,923 --> 01:54:30,686
# Runnin' on #

1766
01:54:30,758 --> 01:54:32,692
# Runnin' on empty #

1767
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,159
# Runnin' on #

1768
01:54:34,228 --> 01:54:36,025
# Runnin' dry #

1769
01:54:36,098 --> 01:54:37,030
# Runnin' on... #

1770
01:54:37,099 --> 01:54:38,691
I'd think a lot...

1771
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:43,033
about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1772
01:54:43,105 --> 01:54:44,629
But most of all,

1773
01:54:44,706 --> 01:54:46,697
I thought about Jenny.

1774
01:54:46,776 --> 01:54:49,540
I thought about her a lot.

1775
01:54:51,014 --> 01:54:52,606
For more than two years,

1776
01:54:52,682 --> 01:54:54,411
a man named Forrest Gump,

1777
01:54:54,484 --> 01:54:57,476
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep,

1778
01:54:57,555 --> 01:54:59,819
has been running across America.

1779
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:01,983
Charles Cooper brings you this report.

1780
01:55:02,059 --> 01:55:03,321
For the fourth time

1781
01:55:03,394 --> 01:55:04,986
on his journey across America,

1782
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:07,497
Forrest Gump, the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1783
01:55:07,566 --> 01:55:10,330
is about to cross the Mississippi River again today.

1784
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,835
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1785
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,837
Sir, where are you running?

1786
01:55:13,905 --> 01:55:16,339
Are you doing this for world peace?

1787
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,843
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1788
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:20,845
Are you running for women's rights?

1789
01:55:20,913 --> 01:55:21,845
The environment?

1790
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:23,176
they just couldn't believe

1791
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:25,683
that Somebody would do all that running

1792
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,185
for no particular reason.

1793
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,846
Why are you doing this?

1794
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:31,186
I just felt like running.

1795
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:32,885
I just felt like runnin'.

1796
01:55:33,962 --> 01:55:34,894
That's you.

1797
01:55:34,963 --> 01:55:37,557
I can't believe it's really you.

1798
01:55:37,632 --> 01:55:39,065
Now...for some reason,

1799
01:55:39,133 --> 01:55:41,567
what I was doing seemed to...

1800
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:43,160
make sense to people.

1801
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,173
It was like an alarm went off in my head.

1802
01:55:46,242 --> 01:55:49,268
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1803
01:55:49,345 --> 01:55:51,279
Here's somebody who has the answer."

1804
01:55:51,347 --> 01:55:53,281
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1805
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,682
So I got company.

1806
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,780
And after that, I got more company.

1807
01:55:59,856 --> 01:56:03,383
And then, even more people joined in.

1808
01:56:05,396 --> 01:56:07,077
Somebody later told me

1809
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,768
it gave people hope.

1810
01:56:10,347 --> 01:56:11,507
Now...

1811
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:14,072
Now, I don't know anything about that,

1812
01:56:14,151 --> 01:56:16,585
but some of those people asked me

1813
01:56:16,654 --> 01:56:18,588
if I could help them out.

1814
01:56:18,656 --> 01:56:21,090
I was wondering if you might help me.

1815
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:23,092
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1816
01:56:23,161 --> 01:56:24,753
I need a good slogan,

1817
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:26,764
and since you've been so inspirational,

1818
01:56:26,832 --> 01:56:29,426
I thought you might be able to help me...

1819
01:56:29,501 --> 01:56:31,264
Whoa, man! You just ran

1820
01:56:31,336 --> 01:56:33,634
through a big pile of dog shit!

1821
01:56:34,874 --> 01:56:36,466
It happens.

1822
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:37,907
What, shit?

1823
01:56:38,978 --> 01:56:40,275
Sometimes.

1824
01:56:42,716 --> 01:56:45,184
And some years later, I heard that that fella

1825
01:56:45,252 --> 01:56:47,516
did come up with a bumper sticker slogan

1826
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:50,853
and made a lot of money off of it.

1827
01:56:50,924 --> 01:56:52,858
Another time, I was running along.

1828
01:56:52,927 --> 01:56:55,862
Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,

1829
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:59,366
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1830
01:56:59,434 --> 01:57:01,368
but he couldn't draw that well,

1831
01:57:01,436 --> 01:57:03,370
and he didn't have a camera.

1832
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:06,875
Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.

1833
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,080
Have a nice day.

1834
01:57:14,684 --> 01:57:16,618
Someyears later, I found out

1835
01:57:16,686 --> 01:57:20,122
that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1836
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:22,351
He made a lot of money.

1837
01:57:24,695 --> 01:57:26,629
Anyway, like I was saying,

1838
01:57:26,697 --> 01:57:29,632
I had a lot of company.

1839
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,133
My mama always said,

1840
01:57:31,203 --> 01:57:34,138
"You got to put the past behind you

1841
01:57:34,206 --> 01:57:36,640
before you can move on. "

1842
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:40,644
And I think that's what my running was all about.

1843
01:57:42,048 --> 01:57:44,642
I had run for three years...

1844
01:57:44,717 --> 01:57:46,651
two months....

1845
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,812
14 days, and 16 hours.

1846
01:58:04,005 --> 01:58:06,496
Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something.

1847
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:20,045
I'm pretty tired.

1848
01:58:22,693 --> 01:58:24,786
Think I'll go home now .

1849
01:58:42,715 --> 01:58:45,309
Now what are we supposed to do?

1850
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,144
And just like that...

1851
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:51,423
my runnin' days was over.

1852
01:58:52,826 --> 01:58:55,158
So I went home to Alabama.

1853
01:58:55,362 --> 01:58:57,592
Moments ago, at 2:25 P.M.,

1854
01:58:57,664 --> 01:59:00,098
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1855
01:59:02,003 --> 01:59:03,937
Five or six gunshots were fired

1856
01:59:04,005 --> 01:59:05,939
by an unknown, would-be assassin.

1857
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:08,441
The president was shot in the chest...

1858
01:59:08,509 --> 01:59:10,101
I picked up the mail.

1859
01:59:10,179 --> 01:59:12,773
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,

1860
01:59:12,848 --> 01:59:15,043
I got a letter from Jenny

1861
01:59:15,117 --> 01:59:17,551
wondering if I could come down to Savannah

1862
01:59:17,619 --> 01:59:21,055
and see her, and that's what I'm doing here.

1863
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:24,559
She saw me on TV... running.

1864
01:59:24,627 --> 01:59:29,121
I'm supposed to go on the number 9 bus to Richmond Street

1865
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,135
and get off and go one block left

1866
01:59:32,203 --> 01:59:34,637
to 1947 Henry Street...

1867
01:59:34,705 --> 01:59:35,967
apartment 4.

1868
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,635
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1869
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:43,647
Henry Street is just five or six blocks...

1870
01:59:43,715 --> 01:59:45,649
down that way.

1871
01:59:45,717 --> 01:59:47,150
Down that way?

1872
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:48,652
Down that way .

1873
01:59:50,556 --> 01:59:52,888
It was nice talking to you.

1874
01:59:55,228 --> 01:59:57,662
I hope everything works out for you!

1875
02:00:06,907 --> 02:00:09,000
Forrest!

1876
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:10,840
How you doin'?

1877
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,345
Come in! Come in!

1878
02:00:12,413 --> 02:00:13,846
I got your letter.

1879
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:15,849
Oh, I was wondering about that.

1880
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:19,186
This your house?

1881
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:20,847
Yeah. It's messy right now.

1882
02:00:20,923 --> 02:00:22,857
I just got off work.

1883
02:00:22,925 --> 02:00:25,018
It's nice.

1884
02:00:25,094 --> 02:00:26,959
You got air-conditioning.

1885
02:00:33,103 --> 02:00:34,365
Thank you.

1886
02:00:34,437 --> 02:00:35,870
I ate some.

1887
02:00:38,276 --> 02:00:43,009
I, uh, kept...kept a scrap book of...of your clippings and...

1888
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,980
everything. There you are.

1889
02:00:46,952 --> 02:00:48,817
Yes, I got you running.

1890
02:00:50,889 --> 02:00:53,983
I ran a long way.

1891
02:00:54,059 --> 02:00:55,720
It's a long time.

1892
02:00:58,064 --> 02:00:59,053
There...

1893
02:01:06,073 --> 02:01:08,667
Listen, Forrest, I don't know how to say this.

1894
02:01:12,246 --> 02:01:13,178
I just...

1895
02:01:13,247 --> 02:01:14,680
I want to apologize

1896
02:01:14,748 --> 02:01:18,684
for anything that I ever did to you 'cause...

1897
02:01:18,753 --> 02:01:20,186
I was messed up...

1898
02:01:20,255 --> 02:01:21,847
for a long time, and...

1899
02:01:26,429 --> 02:01:27,361
Hey, you.

1900
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:29,864
This is my old friend from Alabama.

1901
02:01:29,932 --> 02:01:31,524
How do you do?

1902
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,058
Next week my schedule changes, so I can...

1903
02:01:35,138 --> 02:01:37,572
No problem. Got to go. I'm double-parked.

1904
02:01:37,641 --> 02:01:38,608
O.K. Thanks.

1905
02:01:41,278 --> 02:01:43,712
This is my very good friend Mr. Gump.

1906
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:45,042
Can you say hi?

1907
02:01:45,116 --> 02:01:46,549
Hello, Mr. Gump.

1908
02:01:46,617 --> 02:01:47,481
Hello.

1909
02:01:47,552 --> 02:01:49,782
Can I go watch TV now?

1910
02:01:49,854 --> 02:01:51,685
Yes. Just keep it low.

1911
02:01:53,891 --> 02:01:55,654
You're a mama, Jenny.

1912
02:01:55,728 --> 02:01:57,195
I'm a mama.

1913
02:02:00,532 --> 02:02:01,965
His name's Forrest.

1914
02:02:03,402 --> 02:02:04,334
Like me!

1915
02:02:05,739 --> 02:02:08,173
I named him after his daddy.

1916
02:02:09,409 --> 02:02:13,175
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1917
02:02:13,246 --> 02:02:14,679
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1918
02:02:31,266 --> 02:02:32,699
Forrest, look at me.

1919
02:02:32,768 --> 02:02:35,236
Look at me, Forrest.

1920
02:02:37,273 --> 02:02:39,207
There's nothing you need to do.

1921
02:02:39,275 --> 02:02:41,209
You didn't do anything wrong.

1922
02:02:42,278 --> 02:02:43,210
O.K.?

1923
02:02:47,718 --> 02:02:49,447
Isn't he beautiful?

1924
02:02:50,721 --> 02:02:53,656
He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1925
02:02:57,729 --> 02:02:58,661
But...

1926
02:03:02,233 --> 02:03:04,667
is...is he s-smart? Like, can he...

1927
02:03:04,737 --> 02:03:06,329
He's very smart.

1928
02:03:06,405 --> 02:03:09,602
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1929
02:03:18,251 --> 02:03:20,845
Yeah, it's O.K. Go talk to him.

1930
02:03:30,264 --> 02:03:31,697
What are you watching?

1931
02:03:31,766 --> 02:03:33,199
Bert and Ernie.

1932
02:03:56,184 --> 02:03:57,378
Forrest...

1933
02:03:59,354 --> 02:04:00,685
I'm sick.

1934
02:04:03,192 --> 02:04:06,628
What, do you have a cough due to a cold?

1935
02:04:06,696 --> 02:04:10,132
I have some kind of virus, and the doctors,

1936
02:04:10,199 --> 02:04:12,133
they don't know what it is,

1937
02:04:12,202 --> 02:04:15,296
and there isn't anything they can do about it.

1938
02:04:20,044 --> 02:04:22,137
You could come home with me.

1939
02:04:23,882 --> 02:04:25,474
Jenny, you and...

1940
02:04:25,550 --> 02:04:26,482
little Forrest

1941
02:04:26,551 --> 02:04:27,984
could come stay

1942
02:04:28,053 --> 02:04:30,351
at my house in Greenbow.

1943
02:04:33,726 --> 02:04:36,820
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1944
02:04:39,065 --> 02:04:41,158
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1945
02:04:47,074 --> 02:04:48,041
O.K.

1946
02:04:49,209 --> 02:04:50,938
Please take your seats.

1947
02:04:54,515 --> 02:04:55,777
Forrest?

1948
02:04:55,850 --> 02:04:57,511
It's time to start.

1949
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:19,872
Your tie.

1950
02:05:32,624 --> 02:05:34,888
Lieutenant Dan.

1951
02:05:49,676 --> 02:05:51,303
Lieutenant Dan.

1952
02:05:52,513 --> 02:05:54,003
Hello, Forrest.

1953
02:05:54,081 --> 02:05:56,606
You got new legs.

1954
02:05:56,683 --> 02:05:58,617
New legs!

1955
02:05:58,686 --> 02:06:01,780
Yeah. I got new legs.

1956
02:06:01,856 --> 02:06:03,118
Custom-made.

1957
02:06:03,191 --> 02:06:04,283
Titanium alloy.

1958
02:06:04,359 --> 02:06:07,453
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1959
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,827
Magic legs.

1960
02:06:14,703 --> 02:06:15,635
This...

1961
02:06:16,705 --> 02:06:18,229
is my fiancee.

1962
02:06:18,308 --> 02:06:19,240
Susan.

1963
02:06:21,711 --> 02:06:24,271
Lieutenant Dan.

1964
02:06:24,347 --> 02:06:26,440
Hi, Forrest.

1965
02:06:26,516 --> 02:06:28,984
Lieutenant Dan...

1966
02:06:29,053 --> 02:06:30,645
this is my Jenny.

1967
02:06:30,721 --> 02:06:33,986
Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.

1968
02:06:44,269 --> 02:06:46,829
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny

1969
02:06:46,905 --> 02:06:48,372
to be your wife?

1970
02:06:50,176 --> 02:06:52,610
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest

1971
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:54,271
to be your husband?

1972
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:59,307
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1973
02:07:45,403 --> 02:07:46,802
Hey, Forrest...

1974
02:07:52,177 --> 02:07:54,668
were you scared in Vietnam?

1975
02:07:56,016 --> 02:07:57,779
Yes.

1976
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:59,443
Well, I...

1977
02:07:59,519 --> 02:08:01,646
I don't know.

1978
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:03,780
Sometimes it would stop raining

1979
02:08:03,857 --> 02:08:07,258
long enough for the stars to come out...

1980
02:08:10,197 --> 02:08:12,131
and then it was nice.

1981
02:08:15,404 --> 02:08:18,464
It was like just before the sun goes to bed

1982
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:19,939
down on the bayou.

1983
02:08:20,008 --> 02:08:24,741
there was always a million sparkles on the water...

1984
02:08:26,549 --> 02:08:28,676
like that mountain lake.

1985
02:08:28,751 --> 02:08:30,685
It was so clear, Jenny,

1986
02:08:30,753 --> 02:08:33,688
it looked like there were two skies

1987
02:08:33,756 --> 02:08:35,690
one on top of the other.

1988
02:08:37,394 --> 02:08:40,761
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...

1989
02:08:43,233 --> 02:08:44,666
I couldn't tell

1990
02:08:44,736 --> 02:08:50,538
where heaven stopped and the earth began.

1991
02:08:51,843 --> 02:08:54,004
It's so beautiful.

1992
02:08:58,084 --> 02:09:01,110
I wish I could've been there with you.

1993
02:09:04,358 --> 02:09:06,349
You were.

1994
02:09:16,604 --> 02:09:18,299
I love you.

1995
02:09:22,377 --> 02:09:25,505
You died on a Saturday morning.

1996
02:09:27,383 --> 02:09:31,479
And I had you placed here under our tree.

1997
02:09:35,892 --> 02:09:39,328
And I had that house of your father's

1998
02:09:39,396 --> 02:09:41,660
bulldozed to the ground.

1999
02:09:44,902 --> 02:09:46,096
Mama...

2000
02:09:47,238 --> 02:09:49,172
always said

2001
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:53,336
that dyin' was a part of life .

2002
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:57,677
I sure wish it wasn't.

2003
02:10:01,086 --> 02:10:02,610
Little Forrest is...

2004
02:10:03,923 --> 02:10:06,187
doing just fine.

2005
02:10:06,259 --> 02:10:07,248
"But..."

2006
02:10:07,326 --> 02:10:09,760
About to start school again so on,

2007
02:10:09,829 --> 02:10:11,854
and...

2008
02:10:11,931 --> 02:10:15,196
and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner

2009
02:10:15,269 --> 02:10:16,327
every day.

2010
02:10:18,105 --> 02:10:19,697
I make sure he...

2011
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:22,541
combs his hair

2012
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:24,703
and brushes his teeth every day.

2013
02:10:26,948 --> 02:10:29,508
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

2014
02:10:31,787 --> 02:10:33,220
He's really good.

2015
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:35,382
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2016
02:10:39,962 --> 02:10:41,395
We fish a lot.

2017
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:47,167
And every night, we read a book.

2018
02:10:47,237 --> 02:10:48,670
He's so smart, Jenny.

2019
02:10:51,742 --> 02:10:53,835
You'd be so proud of him.

2020
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,842
I am.

2021
02:10:58,249 --> 02:11:01,412
He, uh, wrote you a...a letter.

2022
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:05,689
And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,

2023
02:11:05,757 --> 02:11:08,692
so I'll just leave it here for you.

2024
02:11:24,945 --> 02:11:26,846
Jenny...

2025
02:11:31,752 --> 02:11:34,687
I don't know if Mama was right

2026
02:11:34,755 --> 02:11:37,849
or if it...it's Lieutenant Dan.

2027
02:11:37,924 --> 02:11:39,789
I don't know...

2028
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:43,590
if we each have a...

2029
02:11:44,766 --> 02:11:45,892
destiny...

2030
02:11:47,368 --> 02:11:51,134
or if we're all just floating around accidental-like

2031
02:11:51,206 --> 02:11:52,639
on a breeze...

2032
02:11:56,879 --> 02:11:58,813
but I...I think...

2033
02:12:00,717 --> 02:12:02,480
maybe it's both.

2034
02:12:06,723 --> 02:12:09,954
Maybe both get happening at the same time.

2035
02:12:15,733 --> 02:12:17,667
But I miss you, Jenny.

2036
02:12:24,242 --> 02:12:26,233
If there's anything you need...

2037
02:12:27,412 --> 02:12:29,346
I won't be far away.

2038
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:06,153
Here's your bus.

2039
02:13:06,222 --> 02:13:07,587
O.K.

2040
02:13:07,656 --> 02:13:10,147
Hey...

2041
02:13:10,227 --> 02:13:11,660
I know this.

2042
02:13:11,728 --> 02:13:14,162
I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell

2043
02:13:14,231 --> 02:13:17,394
because Grandma used to read it to you.

2044
02:13:17,467 --> 02:13:19,526
My favorite book.

2045
02:13:23,007 --> 02:13:24,440
Here we are.

2046
02:13:24,508 --> 02:13:25,839
Hey...

2047
02:13:27,746 --> 02:13:29,179
here you go.

2048
02:13:34,353 --> 02:13:35,911
Hey, Forrest...

2049
02:13:35,988 --> 02:13:37,455
don't...

2050
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,785
I want to tell you I love you.

2051
02:13:42,862 --> 02:13:44,830
I love you, too, Daddy.

2052
02:13:44,898 --> 02:13:47,765
I'll be right here when you get back.

2053
02:13:53,207 --> 02:13:56,643
You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?

2054
02:13:56,711 --> 02:14:00,477
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
