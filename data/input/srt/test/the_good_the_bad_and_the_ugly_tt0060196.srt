1
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,920
You're from Baker?

2
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,608
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.

3
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:56,318
Tell him I want to live
in peace, understand?

4
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,321
There is no use to
go on tormenting me!

5
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:02,240
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

6
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,784
Now that gold has disappeared,
but if he'd listened,

7
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,112
we could have avoided
this altogether.

8
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:09,331
I went to the army court.

9
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:11,124
There were no witnesses.

10
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,543
They couldn't uncover any more.

11
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:16,546
I can't tell Baker what
happened to the money.

12
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,249
Go back and tell him that.

13
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:22,920
Word's around you had a visitor,

14
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,507
and Baker knows it.

15
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,428
Name of Jackson.

16
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,435
Well, Jackson was here

17
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,480
or Baker's got it all wrong.

18
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,073
He's not wrong.

19
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,500
Maybe Baker would like to know

20
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:58,706
just what you and Jackson had
to say about the cash box.

21
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,754
That's not what I'm being paid for.

22
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:13,012
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

23
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,234
Why do you think Jackson may
be assuming another name?

24
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,103
I would have found him already.

25
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:25,024
When I start off to find
somebody, I find him.

26
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,443
That's why they pay me.

27
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,201
What is Baker paying you?

28
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,039
That your family?

29
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:51,391
Yes.

30
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,469
Nice family.

31
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,808
What does he pay you
for murdering me?

32
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,105
$500

33
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,190
to get the name.

34
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:13,990
The name.

35
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,252
Carson. Bill Carson.

36
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:29,255
That's what he calls himself now.

37
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,788
That's a lot of money. $1,000.

38
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,502
$1,000?

39
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,633
And some in gold.
That's a tidy sum.

40
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:23,392
But when I'm paid, I always
see the job through.

41
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:37,591
It's you.

42
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,718
Any information?

43
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,389
Too much.

44
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,776
He said quite a bit that
should interest you,

45
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,612
and one or two things
that interested me.

46
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,064
Such as?

47
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,652
The name Jackson's hiding
under is Bill Carson.

48
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,487
Ah.

49
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,365
That's your bit.

50
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,244
Keep talking.

51
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:10,090
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box,

52
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,084
which just happened to disappear.

53
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,095
That's my bit.

54
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,797
Anything else?

55
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,883
Not enough for you, eh?

56
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,851
Well, you don't have to worry.

57
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:23,762
He'll never say anything
to anybody again.

58
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,348
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.

59
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,268
Here you are.

60
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,736
Here. This is for you.

61
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,738
You did a good job for me.

62
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,907
Worth $500.

63
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,413
Yeah. I almost forgot.

64
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,365
He gave me $1,000.

65
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,619
I think his idea was
that I kill you.

66
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,302
But you know the pity
is, when I'm paid,

67
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,756
I always follow my job through.

68
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,008
You know that.

69
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,809
No! Angel Eyes...

70
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:52,150
No. No pistol, <i>amigo</i>.
It won't do you any good.

71
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,811
There are three of us.

72
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:09,994
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>

73
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:15,423
You know you've got a face beautiful
enough to be worth $2,000?

74
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:18,919
Yeah.

75
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:23,507
But you don't look like the
one who'll collect it.

76
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,350
A couple steps back.

77
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,323
Thank you.

78
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,925
How much are you worth now?

79
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,211
How much?

80
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,422
$2,000.

81
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,684
That's right, $2,000.

82
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,970
Yeah, $2,000.

83
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:05,450
You'll pay for this! I hope
you end up in a graveyard

84
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:08,453
with the cholera and the
rabies and the plague!

85
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,704
Cut me loose!

86
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,789
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!

87
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,625
Put me down!

88
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,502
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

89
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:18,705
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!

90
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,966
You can still save yourself.

91
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,294
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

92
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,055
Let me go.

93
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,932
I think I feel sick.

94
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,851
The blood is bursting through my...

95
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,637
I'm dry, Blondie.

96
00:20:35,397 --> 00:20:36,682
Water.

97
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:47,742
You swine. You son of
a bitch. Let me go!

98
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,661
You're brave with a
man who's tied up!

99
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,412
Come back!

100
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:55,826
Come back and fight! You bastard.

101
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,836
Who the hell is that?

102
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,005
One bastard goes in,
another comes out.

103
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:03,007
Cut it out! Cut it out!

104
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:06,545
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...

105
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:12,558
So, you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?

106
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,726
Me?

107
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:15,053
Yeah, it's you.

108
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:20,358
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

109
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,527
Yeah, roll it up. Roll it up.

110
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:25,154
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

111
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:28,866
To hell with all you sheriffs and
deputies and all who gave birth to you.

112
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,245
Hey, everybody, look, look. He's
giving him the filthy money.

113
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:35,498
Judas. You sold my hide.

114
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:37,792
But you won't enjoy any of
that money, not a penny.

115
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:39,043
If there's justice in the world,

116
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,461
that money will go
to the undertakers.

117
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:41,879
Every penny of it.

118
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,048
You know who you are?

119
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,384
You want to know whose son you are?

120
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,761
You don't, I do. Everybody does.

121
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:52,598
You're the son of a thousand
fathers, all bastards like you.

122
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,642
And your mother... Your mother!

123
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,929
She's... You bastard!

124
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:00,857
Your mother... It's better
not to talk of her!

125
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,309
I never hurt anybody!

126
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:06,571
"Wanted in 14 counties

135

Therefore, according to
the powers vested in us,

136
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,905
we sentence the accused
here before us

137
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:52,784
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

138
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:53,910
Known as "The Rat."

139
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,946
and any other aliases he might have

140
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,665
to hang by the neck until dead.

141
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,250
May God have mercy on his soul.

142
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,578
Proceed.

143
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,865
Five for you. One, two

144
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:35,694
three, four, five for me.

145
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:41,450
Five for you and five for me.

146
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,794
Know how much you're worth now?

147
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:46,712
No. How much?

148
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,332
$3,000.

149
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:55,012
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend,

150
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,389
those with a rope
around their neck,

151
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,016
and the people who have the
job of doing the cutting.

152
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:02,437
Listen, the neck at the
end of the rope is mine.

153
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,222
I run the risks.

154
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,526
So the next time,
I want more than half.

155
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:12,397
You may run the risks, my
friend, but I do the cutting.

156
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:16,652
If we cut down my percentage...

157
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,030
Cigar?

158
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,742
It's liable to
interfere with my aim.

159
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:29,706
But if you miss, you had
better miss very well.

160
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,385
Whoever double crosses
me and leaves me alive,

161
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,054
he understands nothing about Tuco.

162
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:39,883
Nothing.

163
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,105
"Wanted in 15 counties
of this state."

164
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:48,191

165
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:49,859

"...bank robbery, highway robbery,"

174

"robbing an unknown number of

175
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,720
What'd you find out, Shorty?

176
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,722
If you ask me,
it seems like a book.

177
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:22,433
An armed unit escorting
a cash box of gold coins

178
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:26,437
meets a Yankee ambush, and
only three of them are saved.

179
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:29,106
Stevens, Baker and Jackson.

180
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,609
The thing that wasn't saved,
though, was the coins.

181
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,361
But then the army
decides, of course,

182
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,738
it ought to hold a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

183
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:38,533
He disappears and
becomes Bill Carson.

184
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:39,742
I know his name.

185
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:42,870
But you don't know just who
you're looking for, and I do.

186
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:46,658
And when he's found, I'd be
scared to be put in his shoes.

187
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,545
Where is Carson?

188
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,255
All I know is Carson reenlisted.

189
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,881
The poor guy's minus an eye.

190
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:56,259
He lives with a girl called
Maria who'll tell you.

191
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,378
She's a fresh young
whore in the territory.

192
00:25:58,637 --> 00:25:59,762
Where's she?

193
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:01,764
Now, what's the name of that town?

194
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:03,508
Someplace fairly near.

195
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:07,512
Santa Ana.

196
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:13,310
Adios, half-soldier.

197
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:19,407
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

198
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:21,534
"And the sheriff's office in Sonora."

199
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:24,662
"The condemned hired himself out
as a guide to a wagon train."

200
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:28,082
"After receiving his payment in
advance, he deserted the wagon train"

201
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,751
"on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux Indians."

202
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:34,547
Glad they got him, a man
guilty of all those crimes.

203
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,465
People with ropes around their
necks don't always hang.

204
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,251
What do you mean?

205
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,344
"The condemned is also guilty..."

206
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:43,507
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

207
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,521
"...as a Mexican general."

208
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:52,724
A golden-haired angel
watches over him.

209
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:55,318
"For all these crimes,"

210
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,279
"the accused has made a full,
spontaneous confession."

211
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,907
"Therefore, we condemn him to be
hung by the neck until dead."

212
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,993
May the Lord have
mercy on his soul.

213
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,570
Proceed.

214
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:22,587
Let's get the hell out of here!

215
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,754
What are you trying to say,
anybody can miss a shot?

216
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,756
Nobody misses when I'm
at the end of the rope.

217
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:00,591
You've never had a
rope around your neck.

218
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:02,301
Well, I'm going to
tell you something.

219
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,178
When that rope starts
to pull tight,

220
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:06,548
you can feel the
devil bite your ass.

221
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:13,805
Yeah, you're right.
It's getting tougher.

222
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,110
The way I figure, there's
really not too much future

223
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:21,362
with a sawed-off runt like you.

224
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:22,655
What do you mean?

225
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,318
'Cause I don't think you'll
ever be worth more than $3,000.

226
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:28,987
What do you mean?

227
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:32,324
I mean, our partnership is untied.

228
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,995
Oh, no. Not you. You remain tied.

229
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:39,956
I'll keep the money, and
you can have the rope.

230
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:43,217
You filthy,
double-crossing bastard!

231
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:44,885
Of all the stinking,
dirty tricks...

232
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:47,672
The way back to town
is only 70 miles.

233
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:50,307
You know, if you save your breath,

234
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:52,260
I feel a man like you
could manage it.

235
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:57,390
You filthy bastard! Come here!

236
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:00,151
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse.

237
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,653
Get off that horse,
you filthy coward!

238
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:05,531
If I ever catch you, Blondie, I'll
rip your heart out and eat it!

239
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,241
I'll scalp you!
I'll skin you alive!

240
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,659
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!

241
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,453
You pig! You vulture!

242
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:13,865
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

243
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:19,704
Such ingratitude, after all the
times I've saved your life.

244
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,095
Where are you going? Wait a
minute. This is only a trick.

245
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,513
You wouldn't leave me here.

246
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:32,475
Come back! Wait! Blondie!

247
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:34,928
Listen, Blondie...

248
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:01,413
I believe madam is home.

249
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:06,960
Sweet dreams, and many thanks
from the Seventh Cavalry!

250
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,095
You filthy rats!

251
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:34,863
Maria.

252
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:43,788
- Honey?
- Is that you, Bill?

253
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,458
Bill.

254
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:59,471
Who are you? What do
you want with me?

255
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,807
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

256
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,351
I don't know him.

257
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:09,147
You were calling to
him in the dark.

258
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,827
Where is he?

259
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,738
What are you going to do to him?

260
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,700
I'll ask the questions.

261
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,079
Where is he?

262
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,888
Where is he? Where?

263
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:36,966
Where? Where? Where?

264
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,014
That's enough!

265
00:31:44,858 --> 00:31:46,358
I don't know where he is.

266
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,277
He packed his things ten days ago

267
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:51,739
and went away with
his unit. They all left.

268
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,691
Which company? Where'd they go?

269
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:57,995
Hmm?

270
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:00,532
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.

271
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,576
They left for Santa Fe.

272
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,204
That's all I know, I swear!

273
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:34,459
But, but...

274
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:41,598
I'm very sorry, but
the store's closing.

275
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,051
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,305
Revolvers.

277
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,715
Yeah, revolvers.

278
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,680
Revolvers.

279
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,558
Well, here's where I
keep the best ones.

280
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:40,191
Here. Remington, Colt,

281
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:46,114
a Roat, Smith-Wesson, Colt, Navy,

282
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:50,209
Joslyn, another Remington.

283
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,036
- And this one is...
- That's enough.

284
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,789
Cartridges.

285
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,023
You want to try the pistol?

286
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:49,060
- Just step out back.
- Let's go.

287
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,601
Move. Move.

288
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:13,428
Cartridge.

289
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:22,903
How much?

290
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:24,313
$20.

291
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:28,317
No.

292
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:33,322
$50.

293
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:36,492
How much?

294
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,578
$100

295
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:44,625
$200. It's all I've got.

296
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,919
Here.

297
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,648
Come here.

298
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:21,795
Eh?

299
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,247
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:32,089
<i>If you work for a living, why
do you kill yourself working?</i>

301
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:16,092
<i>If you work for a living, why
do you kill yourself working?</i>

302
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,995
Potatoes.

303
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:48,457
You've got to be poor
to eat potatoes.

304
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,168
Really poor.

305
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:55,381
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

306
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,352
The world is divided
into two parts,

307
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:05,850
those who have friends, and those
who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

308
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:13,024
You see, I used to
have a friend, Pedro.

309
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,695
Chico and Ramon, his two
brothers, were my friends, too.

310
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:23,576
But who knows where they are now?

311
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:28,839
It's too bad, friends. Tough
luck I haven't found you.

312
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,167
I had a good deal for you.

313
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:37,256
There's a big son of a
bitch who's got $4,000.

314
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,593
$4,000.

315
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:43,679
And I know where to find it.

316
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,817
If they would help me catch him,

317
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:51,562
I'd divide it four
ways, like a brother.

318
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:55,149
$1,000 each.

319
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:56,942
Hmm.

320
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:15,044
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

321
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:21,057
And rich. Like you're going to be.

322
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:24,053
But people are saying you
got killed in Albuquerque.

323
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,263
And people talk bullshit.

324
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:33,487
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

325
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:36,774
And I've come to give you $3,000.

326
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:57,385
This morning, I heard
the whole thing.

327
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,596
They say Colonel Canby's closing
in with his Northerners,

328
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:02,557
and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

329
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,802
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.

330
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:09,940
You see, as soon as these cowards
hear a Blue Shirt's around, they run.

331
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,525
These Rebels have no will to fight.

332
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:12,943
Poor things.

333
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,611
They'll soon be finished.

334
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:18,281
We get rid of these bastards, then we
begin making money on those Yankees.

335
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:20,367
They carry gold, not paper dollars,

336
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:22,528
and they're going
to beat the South.

337
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:26,998
Look. See that one with the white
beard sitting in the wagon?

338
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,034
General Sibley. He looks dead.

339
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,794
He's finally getting
out of our hair.

340
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:35,875
Hurray for Dixie! Hurray!
Hurray for Dixie!

341
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,131
Where's the owner of that horse?

342
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:44,391
Please, mister, sir,
a bad heart condition...

343
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:46,142
Where?

344
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,895
The war has frightened me already.

345
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:51,314
I'm looking for the
owner of that horse.

346
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,525
He's tall, blond,
he smokes a cigar,

347
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:56,319
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

348
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,322
You leave him be. He doesn't
know who rides every horse.

349
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:01,650
You stay quiet, old hen.

350
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,864
Upstairs. Upstairs
in room four, <i>señor</i>.

351
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,038
Hear that?

352
00:43:19,218 --> 00:43:21,921
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

353
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,409
Your spurs.

354
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:56,392
There are two kinds
of spurs, my friend,

355
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:58,762
those that come in by the door,

356
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:02,065
those that come in by the window.

357
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,976
Take off that pistol belt.

358
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:13,152
It's empty.

359
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:16,955
Mine isn't.

360
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:27,624
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

361
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,630
That could be cannon fire.

362
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:37,134
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

363
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,764
You ever see this
before, my friend?

364
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,609
Throw it over the roof beam.

365
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:57,488
That's it.

366
00:48:09,174 --> 00:48:10,793
Now get on that.

367
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:22,262
That's right.

368
00:48:22,897 --> 00:48:24,473
Now make sure the rope is tight.

369
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:28,268
It's got to hold the
weight of a pig.

370
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,610
Now put the rope around your neck.

371
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:46,411
That's very good.

372
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,422
It's too big for your neck, huh?

373
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:52,793
We fix that right away.
I have another system,

374
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:55,546
a little different than yours.

375
00:48:56,305 --> 00:48:58,181
I don't shoot the rope.

376
00:48:58,182 --> 00:49:00,217
I shoot the legs off the stool.

377
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,339
Welcome, my friend.

378
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,093
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

379
00:52:22,094 --> 00:52:25,012
Our hotel is luxurious and
filled with conveniences.

380
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,809
And the attractions
don't stop there.

381
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,063
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

382
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,107
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

383
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:38,985
Our government has
spared no expense.

384
00:52:38,986 --> 00:52:41,779
As you can see, we are
treated very well.

385
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,283
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

386
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:50,746
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

387
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:52,582
Well, you see, he's
a Yankee colonel

388
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,001
who decided to tear us to pieces.

389
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:58,087
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

390
00:52:58,088 --> 00:53:00,624
And you ask me if I know someone.

391
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:04,461
I just don't know what you
drifters could be thinking.

392
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:19,935
Carson has a patch over one
eye. He's with the Third.

393
00:53:22,112 --> 00:53:26,365
If he's with the Third,
they've already left.

394
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:28,075
For Glorieta.

395
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:30,203
Canby's front line is
right on their heels.

396
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:32,288
Those poor young devils.

397
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,540
And the desert lies ahead of them.

398
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:37,327
I really doubt that any
of them are still alive.

399
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,789
And what if they were still alive?

400
00:53:43,383 --> 00:53:44,751
Worse.

401
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,839
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

402
00:53:49,264 --> 00:53:51,641
It's one of those
Yankee prison camps

403
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,136
you'd better hope you
never end up in.

404
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:57,180
Keep it. It's yours.

405
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:26,629
"We have found the accused, Thomas
Larson, alias Shorty Larson,"

406
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,340
"guilty of the following crimes,"

407
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:33,427
"horse theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union Army,"

408
00:56:33,428 --> 00:56:36,389
"theft of supplies belonging
to the Confederate Army,"

409
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,349
"wounding two vigilantes,"

410
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,394
"assault and battery on
one named Barry O'Keefe,"

411
00:56:41,395 --> 00:56:44,605
"perjury, blackmail, robbery,"

412
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:46,357
"escaping from a state prison,"

413
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:48,526
"disturbing the peace,
pandering, highway robbery..."

414
00:56:48,527 --> 00:56:50,103
And Shorty?

415
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:52,363
"...forgery and murder."

416
00:56:52,364 --> 00:56:55,241
Therefore, with the powers vested
in us by the laws of this state...

417
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:56,409
No.

418
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,535
No?

419
00:56:57,536 --> 00:57:00,329
We have condemned the
aforementioned Thomas Larson,

420
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,041
alias Shorty Larson, to hang
by the neck until dead.

421
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:07,495
May God have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

422
00:57:13,885 --> 00:57:15,712
Sorry, Shorty.

423
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,506
Move. Come on, let's go.

424
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:47,543
I don't know. As soon as I
hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

425
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:52,791
Burns, huh? They say people with
fair skin can't take too much.

426
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:19,609
Like that, you won't
have to carry so much.

427
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:22,821
Where we going?

428
00:58:23,872 --> 00:58:27,242
Where? Where I'm going, <i>amigo</i>.

429
00:58:28,293 --> 00:58:29,793
Over that way.

430
00:58:29,794 --> 00:58:34,256
Another 100 miles of
beautiful, sunbaked sand.

431
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:36,717
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

432
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:39,094
Sibley's men are
retreating up there.

433
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:41,381
Canby's men are coming here.

434
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,301
But no one will set
foot in this hell,

435
00:58:46,478 --> 00:58:48,763
except you and me.

436
00:58:50,357 --> 00:58:53,393
100 miles, that's a nice walk.

437
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:59,107
What was it you told
me the last time?

438
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:05,113
"If you save your breath, I feel
a man like you could manage it."

439
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:11,453
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die, only slowly,

440
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:15,331
very slowly, old friend.

441
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:23,173
After you, please. Start walking.

442
01:01:19,923 --> 01:01:21,583
Taking a rest?

443
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:25,094
Come on, Blondie. We don't
have very far to go.

444
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:27,130
Only 70 miles.

445
01:01:28,264 --> 01:01:31,467
Only eight-and-a-half
hours more before sunset.

446
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:33,887
That's not too bad.

447
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:36,848
Come on.

448
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:29,585
Okay, let's eat.

449
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,171
That is, I'll eat.

450
01:03:33,056 --> 01:03:34,382
Hmm?

451
01:03:35,725 --> 01:03:38,511
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

452
01:03:48,112 --> 01:03:49,647
You want some water?

453
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:55,987
Drink. Drink.

454
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,411
Come on. Come on.

455
01:04:45,044 --> 01:04:47,997
Well, Blondie. So long.

456
01:05:55,573 --> 01:05:57,441
And so, Blondie,

457
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,445
it's goodbye.

458
01:06:58,136 --> 01:07:01,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, boy.

459
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:07,561
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

460
01:07:07,562 --> 01:07:09,889
Attaboy. That's nice.

461
01:09:38,629 --> 01:09:41,999
Water. Water.

462
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:50,056
$200,000 in gold.

463
01:09:50,057 --> 01:09:52,009
It's yours. Just get me water.

464
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:58,808
What's that you say?

465
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:00,859
Who the hell are you?

466
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,353
Carson.

467
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,148
My name is Bill Carson
now. It's Carson.

468
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:08,275
Surprise attack.

469
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,788
All dead. My name is
Jackson, not Carson.

470
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:16,166
Carson, Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.

471
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:20,003
I'm Lincoln's grandfather. What was
that you said about the dollars?

472
01:10:20,004 --> 01:10:21,997
$200,000, all mine.

473
01:10:23,382 --> 01:10:25,334
Was the Third Cavalry's.

474
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:28,671
Baker has nothing.

475
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:33,259
The gold, I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

476
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:37,771
Where? Where, here? Here? Talk.

477
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:40,558
In the cemetery.

478
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:43,151
Which cemetery?

479
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,980
The one on Sad Hill.

480
01:10:47,073 --> 01:10:49,400
There's a grave by...

481
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:53,828
Which grave? Have a name?
Have a number?

482
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:56,490
Come on, you dummy, talk.

483
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:01,954
There's no number. There's a name.

484
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:05,048
It's written...

485
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:06,459
Yes?

486
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:13,757
Water.

487
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:19,020
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.

488
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:20,772
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.

489
01:11:20,773 --> 01:11:22,107
In the grave. Okay.

490
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:24,651
But it must have a name
or a number on it, huh?

491
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:27,354
There must be a thousand,
five thousand.

492
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:33,702
Don't die, huh?

493
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,779
Don't die. I'll get you water.

494
01:11:36,163 --> 01:11:39,582
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

495
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,411
Don't die until later,
you son of a...

496
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:09,438
Get away from there.

497
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:16,870
He's dead.

498
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,113
Yeah.

499
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,451
I'll kill you.

500
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,374
If you do that, you'll
always be poor,

501
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,127
just like the greasy
rat that you are.

502
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:37,265
If I were you, I'd keep me alive.

503
01:12:37,266 --> 01:12:40,602
What did he tell you, huh?

504
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:41,971
A name.

505
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:44,723
A name on a grave.

506
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:46,850
What name?

507
01:13:00,623 --> 01:13:02,791
Blondie, don't die.

508
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:06,294
Blondie, don't die.
I'm your friend.

509
01:13:06,295 --> 01:13:07,629
Please don't die. Please.

510
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,999
I'm your friend. Come on. Come on.

511
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:13,551
Blondie.

512
01:13:13,552 --> 01:13:15,470
I'll help you. I'll help you.

513
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:17,305
Don't move. I'll be right back.

514
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:20,642
Here's the water.
Don't die like that pig.

515
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:24,646
Hey, Blondie, here's water.
Water, Blondie.

516
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:26,648
Don't drink, don't drink.
Is no good for you.

517
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:28,483
Feel better?

518
01:13:28,484 --> 01:13:30,568
Blondie, what's the matter?

519
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:32,438
Please, don't die.

520
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:44,457
Hey, open up! Open up! Hurry!

521
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:47,411
Settle down. Settle
down. Who's there?

522
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:52,708
What do you mean, "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

523
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:59,389
If I were a Yankee, you wouldn't
have time to ask me that.

524
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,807
Come on.

525
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:03,601
Sergeant, listen to this
corporal for a moment.

526
01:14:03,602 --> 01:14:04,686
Yes, sir.

527
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:07,689
Sergeant, I have a gravely
wounded man here,

528
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,059
if he's not dead already.

529
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:12,944
He's still alive?

530
01:14:12,945 --> 01:14:14,730
Well, he seems to be.

531
01:14:16,323 --> 01:14:18,032
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

532
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,742
Only the two of us got away.

533
01:14:19,743 --> 01:14:21,695
Name and traveling papers.

534
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:28,126
Here. Corporal Bill Carson. Third
Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

535
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:30,996
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

536
01:14:36,552 --> 01:14:38,921
Are you reading when
this man is dying?

537
01:14:39,305 --> 01:14:41,139
Why, Corporal, we're
trying to withdraw

538
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,224
and you're looking
for an infirmary?

539
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:46,352
If you want one, you'll have to
make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

540
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,272
So where are we?

541
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:51,058
Near Apache Canyon.

542
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:53,902
Apache Canyon?

543
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:55,069
Apache Canyon.

544
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,572
Is a Mission San
Antonio around here?

545
01:14:57,573 --> 01:15:00,033
Sure, 18 miles south.
Take him there.

546
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:01,910
The brothers take care
of anyone who's wounded,

547
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,912
no matter what the
color of his uniform.

548
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:06,664
And keep your eyes open,
the area is full of Yankees.

549
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:08,500
Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.

550
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:09,952
Take care.

551
01:15:34,485 --> 01:15:35,860
I've got a very sick man here.

552
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:37,445
But we have no more beds here.

553
01:15:37,446 --> 01:15:38,981
Let him have yours.

554
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,287
Where's Pablo Ramirez?

555
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:47,413
Father Ramirez.

556
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:51,834
He's away at the moment. He
should be back any day now.

557
01:15:51,835 --> 01:15:53,294
Well, it doesn't matter.

558
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:56,297
For the moment, we take very
good care of my friend.

559
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:58,132
And may God be praised.

560
01:15:58,133 --> 01:16:00,593
In case you didn't know it,
God is on our side, too,

561
01:16:00,594 --> 01:16:03,805
because he hates the
Yanks, huh, Blondie?

562
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:06,349
Blondie? Father, is
he still breathing?

563
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:08,643
Yes, of course.

564
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:10,596
You're heavy.

565
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:23,192
There.

566
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,599
All right, put a fresh
bandage on him.

567
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:58,727
Put him in my cell.

568
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:00,854
Easy.

569
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:06,451
Out, soldier. Out you go. Come on.

570
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:09,571
Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

571
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,954
Hey, Father, I...

572
01:17:29,642 --> 01:17:32,469
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

573
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:05,259
Father, did he ask for me? Did
he speak about anything, Father?

574
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,886
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken as yet.

575
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:08,429
But you mustn't worry.

576
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,098
He's both young and strong.

577
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:12,517
That's what's kept
him going until now.

578
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:14,977
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

579
01:18:14,978 --> 01:18:16,104
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

580
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:17,689
You don't know how much this
boy's life means to me.

581
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,975
Thanks be to Jesus.
Thanks to all of you.

582
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:10,525
Blondie.

583
01:19:16,331 --> 01:19:18,200
Hey, Blondie.

584
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:42,023
The old father tells me you'll
be up and around in a few days.

585
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:45,860
You're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

586
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:47,938
Think if you'd been on your own.

587
01:19:49,615 --> 01:19:52,241
Look, I mean, when...

588
01:19:52,242 --> 01:19:55,036
When one is ill,

589
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:59,866
it's good to have somebody close
by, friends or relations.

590
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:05,872
Do you have parents,
Blondie? A mother?

591
01:20:06,423 --> 01:20:08,125
Not even a mother.

592
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:10,711
No one?

593
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:14,631
You're all alone, huh?
Like me, Blondie.

594
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,092
We're all alone in the world.

595
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:20,429
I have you, you have me.

596
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,891
Only for a little while, I mean.

597
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:27,644
It had to happen now.

598
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:30,738
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

599
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:33,442
We could have all that
money in our hands.

600
01:20:40,374 --> 01:20:42,917
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.

601
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:45,495
In my place, you would
do the same thing.

602
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:49,708
It's all over for you now.

603
01:20:50,509 --> 01:20:53,128
There's nothing anyone
can do anymore.

604
01:20:55,764 --> 01:20:58,182
God help me. It's my fault.

605
01:20:58,183 --> 01:21:00,552
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

606
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:14,149
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

607
01:21:14,366 --> 01:21:17,952
If I knew that my last
hour had come, I swear

608
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:21,448
in my place, in your place,
I would do the same thing.

609
01:21:22,124 --> 01:21:25,626
I would tell about the gold.
Yes. Yes, I would.

610
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:28,129
I'd tell the name on the grave.

611
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:30,882
After all, what good is the
money to you if you're dead?

612
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:32,800
I know the name of the cemetery,

613
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:35,545
but you know how many
graves there are there?

614
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:39,599
Please, Blondie.

615
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:45,813
Please, have a little, huh?
Here. Coffee.

616
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:47,849
Please, tell me the name

617
01:21:48,525 --> 01:21:51,186
on the grave.

618
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:55,607
If I get my hands on the $200,000,

619
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,319
I'll always honor your memory.

620
01:22:00,078 --> 01:22:03,490
I swear, I'll always
honor your memory.

621
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:08,161
Come closer.

622
01:22:13,342 --> 01:22:15,127
Tell me.

623
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:18,130
Why, you dirty...

624
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:22,717
I'll sleep better

625
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,806
knowing my good
friend is by my side

626
01:22:28,607 --> 01:22:30,809
to protect me.

627
01:22:39,159 --> 01:22:41,452
"Tuco, water." Well, here's water.

628
01:22:41,453 --> 01:22:44,906
But if I get that name from
you, I'll give you water.

629
01:22:52,214 --> 01:22:55,091
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

630
01:22:55,092 --> 01:22:57,218
Come on, come on, the party's over.

631
01:22:57,219 --> 01:22:59,303
The wagon is all ready to go.

632
01:22:59,304 --> 01:23:01,222
From the way the wounded are
pouring into this place,

633
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:02,431
we better get the hell out of here

634
01:23:02,432 --> 01:23:04,600
before we get caught up in the war.

635
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:05,851
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

636
01:23:05,852 --> 01:23:07,137
Yeah.

637
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,146
This is something I
have to look into.

638
01:23:09,147 --> 01:23:11,141
It'll only take a minute.
Get moving.

639
01:23:12,442 --> 01:23:14,102
- Where, this way?
- Yes.

640
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:32,913
Hey, Pablo.

641
01:23:41,304 --> 01:23:43,465
Don't you recognize me?

642
01:23:45,017 --> 01:23:48,720
It's me, Tuco. Let me embrace you.

643
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:55,227
I don't know the right thing.

644
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:02,283
I was just passing by
here, I said to myself,

645
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:04,611
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother."

646
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:09,699
Did I do wrong?

647
01:24:11,752 --> 01:24:14,162
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

648
01:24:14,254 --> 01:24:16,081
You have seen me, Tuco.

649
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:21,336
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

650
01:24:26,892 --> 01:24:31,270
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.

651
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:34,774
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

652
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:37,151
You look very well.

653
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:39,271
A bit thin, perhaps, but

654
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:43,692
you were always thin, eh, Pablito?

655
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,571
What about our parents?

656
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:53,034
Only now do you think of them.

657
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:56,371
To begin after nine years.

658
01:24:57,923 --> 01:24:59,541
Nine years?

659
01:25:01,176 --> 01:25:05,088
So it's nine years. Nine years.

660
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:08,967
Our mother has been
dead a long time now.

661
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:12,679
Our father died only
a few days ago.

662
01:25:13,772 --> 01:25:15,765
That's why I was away.

663
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:21,354
He asked for you to be there,
but there was only me.

664
01:25:29,162 --> 01:25:30,488
And you?

665
01:25:31,289 --> 01:25:34,117
Outside of evil, what else
have you managed to do?

666
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:38,330
It seems to me you once
had a wife someplace.

667
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,843
Not one, lots of them.

668
01:25:43,844 --> 01:25:46,338
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

669
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:50,383
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

670
01:25:52,269 --> 01:25:54,429
What good would that be?

671
01:25:55,772 --> 01:25:58,315
Just keep on the way you're going.

672
01:25:58,316 --> 01:26:00,101
Go away.

673
01:26:01,236 --> 01:26:02,403
And the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

674
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:03,529
Sure, I'll go, I'll go.

675
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:06,407
While I'm waiting for the
Lord to remember me,

676
01:26:06,408 --> 01:26:09,702
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother
of Brother Ramirez,

677
01:26:09,703 --> 01:26:12,079
will tell you something.

678
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,248
You think you're better than I am.

679
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:16,959
Where we came from, if one
didn't want to die of poverty,

680
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,461
one became a priest or a bandit.

681
01:26:19,462 --> 01:26:22,089
You chose your way, I chose mine.

682
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:23,924
Mine was harder!

683
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:25,634
You talk about Mother and Father.

684
01:26:25,635 --> 01:26:29,305
You remember, when you left to
become a priest, I stayed behind.

685
01:26:29,306 --> 01:26:33,267
I must have been 10, 12. I don't
remember which, but I stayed.

686
01:26:33,268 --> 01:26:35,769
I tried, but it was no good.

687
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:37,897
Now I will tell you something.

688
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:41,768
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

689
01:27:00,795 --> 01:27:02,163
Tuco.

690
01:27:13,141 --> 01:27:15,301
Please forgive me, brother.

691
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:46,541
My belly's full.

692
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:50,211
Nice guy, my brother.

693
01:27:50,845 --> 01:27:53,305
I didn't tell you my brother
was in charge here?

694
01:27:53,306 --> 01:27:55,516
Everything. Like the pope almost.

695
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:59,144
He's in charge in Rome. Yeah,
yeah, my brother, he say to me,

696
01:27:59,145 --> 01:28:01,063
"Stay, brother. Don't go home."

697
01:28:01,064 --> 01:28:02,940
"We never see each other."

698
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:07,528
"Here there's plenty to eat and
drink. Bring your friend, too."

699
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:09,863
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

700
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:12,533
It's always the same story.

701
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:15,487
My brother, he is crazy about me.

702
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:23,286
That's so. Even a tramp like
me, no matter what happens,

703
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:27,047
I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me

704
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:28,750
a bowl of soup.

705
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,086
Sure.

706
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,425
Well, after a meal, there's
nothing like a good cigar.

707
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:30,603
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

708
01:29:31,196 --> 01:29:33,940
Going this way, we
cross the Rio Grande.

709
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:36,734
That sure is a long way.

710
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:41,447
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas.

711
01:29:42,123 --> 01:29:44,242
- After that...
- Then what?

712
01:29:46,169 --> 01:29:47,628
When we get there, I'll tell you.

713
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:49,414
You're not worried, are you?

714
01:29:53,051 --> 01:29:56,504
Those men aren't worried about
anything anymore, are they?

715
01:29:59,307 --> 01:30:01,183
But since I'm alive
and I've noticed

716
01:30:01,184 --> 01:30:04,929
we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times,

717
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:08,182
I thought you might tell
me where we're going.

718
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:10,651
Towards $200,000.

719
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:12,562
Is that good enough for you?

720
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,299
Hey, wake up, you.

721
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,676
The troops are coming. Come on.

722
01:30:35,677 --> 01:30:37,253
Blue or gray?

723
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,063
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.

724
01:30:48,064 --> 01:30:52,025
Hoorah! Hoorah for the Confederacy!

725
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:55,404
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!

726
01:30:55,405 --> 01:30:58,574
- Hoorah for General... What's his name?
- Lee.

727
01:30:58,575 --> 01:31:00,485
Lee! Lee!

728
01:31:01,286 --> 01:31:04,697
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too!

729
01:31:06,499 --> 01:31:10,203
God's not on our side 'cause
he hates idiots also.

730
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:26,226
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

731
01:31:26,227 --> 01:31:30,230
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

732
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:33,017
Prisoners of war, forward

733
01:31:34,486 --> 01:31:36,270
march!

734
01:32:28,122 --> 01:32:29,782
Halt!

735
01:32:32,794 --> 01:32:35,329
Left face!

736
01:32:38,424 --> 01:32:41,627
Form a single file. Move!

737
01:33:23,761 --> 01:33:25,137
Jonathan Frost!

738
01:33:25,138 --> 01:33:26,631
Present!

739
01:33:33,187 --> 01:33:34,730
Richard McGilley!

740
01:33:34,731 --> 01:33:36,189
Present!

741
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,691
Nathaniel Sullivan!

742
01:33:37,692 --> 01:33:39,310
Present.

743
01:33:40,403 --> 01:33:42,063
Robert Clark!

744
01:33:42,155 --> 01:33:43,564
Present.

745
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:45,365
Sam Richmond!

746
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:46,567
Present.

747
01:33:49,996 --> 01:33:51,322
Bill Carson!

748
01:33:54,917 --> 01:33:56,744
Bill Carson!

749
01:33:57,795 --> 01:34:00,088
I said Bill Carson!

750
01:34:00,089 --> 01:34:03,209
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

751
01:34:04,052 --> 01:34:06,838
All right, what's
he doing, sleeping?

752
01:34:07,972 --> 01:34:09,465
Bill Carson!

753
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:13,352
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.

754
01:34:13,353 --> 01:34:15,012
Bill Carson!

755
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:17,682
Yeah, that's me.

756
01:34:26,115 --> 01:34:28,109
Please, Carson,

757
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,404
answer "present."

758
01:34:32,872 --> 01:34:34,991
What are you, deaf?

759
01:34:40,672 --> 01:34:42,999
Now suppose you say
"present," Carson.

760
01:34:45,009 --> 01:34:48,261
I like big fat men like you.

761
01:34:48,262 --> 01:34:52,550
When they fall, they make more noise,
and sometimes they never get up.

762
01:34:54,018 --> 01:34:55,636
Wallace,

763
01:34:57,271 --> 01:34:58,681
that's enough.

764
01:35:01,734 --> 01:35:03,060
Sergeant!

765
01:35:04,987 --> 01:35:07,315
The captain wants to
see you right away.

766
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:13,112
Be sure these two
get good treatment.

767
01:35:23,798 --> 01:35:25,632
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?

768
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:27,376
Good treatment.

769
01:35:29,971 --> 01:35:31,297
Yeah.

770
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,344
For the last time, Sergeant,

771
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:41,474
I'm telling you, I want the
prisoners treated as prisoners.

772
01:35:42,066 --> 01:35:43,684
No more brutality.

773
01:35:44,902 --> 01:35:46,445
There's hundreds of
prisoners out there

774
01:35:46,446 --> 01:35:48,655
and only a few men to guard them.

775
01:35:48,656 --> 01:35:51,025
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

776
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:54,453
I think that you'll manage
to gain their respect

777
01:35:54,454 --> 01:35:56,948
by treating them better.

778
01:35:57,331 --> 01:36:00,041
Are our men treated that
well in Andersonville camp?

779
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:02,961
I don't give a God damn what
they do in Andersonville.

780
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:06,339
While I'm in charge here, the
prisoners are not to be tortured,

781
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,585
or cheated or murdered.

782
01:36:10,303 --> 01:36:11,879
That an accusation?

783
01:36:12,263 --> 01:36:17,301
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

784
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,354
I know the prisoners here are
being robbed systematically.

785
01:36:21,355 --> 01:36:24,733
I know there's scum around who
are bivouacked near the camp

786
01:36:24,734 --> 01:36:27,561
waiting for someone
to deliver this loot.

787
01:36:28,029 --> 01:36:32,900
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

788
01:36:35,244 --> 01:36:36,870
Yes.

789
01:36:36,871 --> 01:36:38,864
Just as long as you're
the commandant.

790
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,576
Yes, Sergeant.

791
01:36:45,338 --> 01:36:48,757
I know this leg means I
won't last very long,

792
01:36:48,758 --> 01:36:53,386
but I pray I can manage to have
enough time to amass evidence

793
01:36:53,387 --> 01:36:55,722
and bring to a court-martial

794
01:36:55,723 --> 01:37:01,262
all those who discredit and
dishonor the uniform of the Union.

795
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:08,394
I wish you luck.

796
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:46,140
You and the others better
lay low for a few days.

797
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:48,692
No, I'll keep this. You go.

798
01:37:48,693 --> 01:37:50,561
Wallace will let you know.

799
01:38:01,247 --> 01:38:03,748
Wallace, bring me Carson.

800
01:38:03,749 --> 01:38:05,451
Right.

801
01:38:19,098 --> 01:38:23,101
Listen, Angel Eyes said for
us to lay low for a few days,

802
01:38:23,102 --> 01:38:26,605
but we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

803
01:38:26,606 --> 01:38:28,349
Come on, saddle your horses.

804
01:38:28,858 --> 01:38:30,518
Get in.

805
01:38:39,327 --> 01:38:42,571
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

806
01:38:43,664 --> 01:38:45,950
There's no formalities here.

807
01:38:57,178 --> 01:38:58,838
It's been a long time.

808
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:06,137
You're hungry. Sit down, eat.

809
01:39:25,706 --> 01:39:27,658
I knew it, I knew it.

810
01:39:29,877 --> 01:39:32,163
The minute I saw you,
I said to myself,

811
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:35,833
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."

812
01:39:36,926 --> 01:39:39,086
"I'll bet he got
himself an easy job,"

813
01:39:42,765 --> 01:39:44,842
"and he never forgets a friend."

814
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:47,928
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

815
01:39:50,398 --> 01:39:51,731
Right.

816
01:39:51,732 --> 01:39:53,475
It's good to see old friends again.

817
01:39:55,277 --> 01:39:56,945
Good.

818
01:39:56,946 --> 01:39:59,607
Especially when they've
come from so far away

819
01:40:00,491 --> 01:40:02,568
and have so much to talk about.

820
01:40:04,245 --> 01:40:07,323
And you do have a lot to
talk about, haven't you?

821
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:12,953
You were captured near Fort Craig.

822
01:40:17,633 --> 01:40:19,426
Well, if you were with
Sibley, that means then

823
01:40:19,427 --> 01:40:22,254
that you were coming from Santa Fe.

824
01:40:35,609 --> 01:40:37,777
Was it hard crossing the desert?

825
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:39,772
Mmm-Hmm. Very hard.

826
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:43,817
Especially if you don't
have anything to drink.

827
01:40:46,412 --> 01:40:49,156
Why are you going under the
name of Bill Carson now?

828
01:40:55,171 --> 01:40:57,922
One name is as good as another.

829
01:40:57,923 --> 01:40:59,833
Not wise to use your own name.

830
01:41:00,926 --> 01:41:02,177
Like you.

831
01:41:02,178 --> 01:41:04,338
I'll bet they don't
call you Angel Eyes.

832
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:07,307
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

833
01:41:16,317 --> 01:41:19,486
Like a little music
with your meal, Tuco?

834
01:41:19,487 --> 01:41:23,857
Music? Yes, it's very good,
very good for the digestion.

835
01:41:37,296 --> 01:41:38,664
So...

836
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:42,251
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

837
01:41:47,681 --> 01:41:49,174
That fake, too?

838
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,595
Bill Carson's name's written in it.

839
01:41:55,189 --> 01:41:59,184
Have some. It's Bill
Carson's tobacco.

840
01:43:23,194 --> 01:43:25,187
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

841
01:43:32,369 --> 01:43:34,446
What'd he tell you about the money?

842
01:43:35,122 --> 01:43:37,332
I don't...

843
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:40,160
I don't know what
you're talking about.

844
01:43:58,812 --> 01:44:00,556
More feeling.

845
01:44:18,999 --> 01:44:22,669
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

846
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:25,672
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

847
01:44:25,673 --> 01:44:28,292
So many of us have had
a session in there.

848
01:44:49,947 --> 01:44:52,065
How's your digestion now?

849
01:44:56,036 --> 01:44:57,870
You'd better talk.

850
01:44:57,871 --> 01:45:00,324
I have nothing to tell you.

851
01:45:27,735 --> 01:45:29,561
Play that fiddle, you.

852
01:46:12,446 --> 01:46:16,817
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.

853
01:46:26,001 --> 01:46:28,328
What did he say about the money?

854
01:46:32,132 --> 01:46:34,793
It's buried in a grave.

855
01:46:35,969 --> 01:46:37,470
Where?

856
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:38,971
Sad Hill.

857
01:46:38,972 --> 01:46:41,633
Sad Hill Cemetery.

858
01:46:44,311 --> 01:46:45,887
Which grave?

859
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:50,559
I don't know. I don't know, I tell you.

860
01:46:51,819 --> 01:46:56,072
Blondie. Ask Blondie.

861
01:46:56,073 --> 01:46:58,817
He knows the name on the grave.

862
01:47:20,722 --> 01:47:22,591
Put those clothes on.

863
01:47:26,854 --> 01:47:28,521
Why?

864
01:47:28,522 --> 01:47:30,223
We're going for a ride.

865
01:47:31,567 --> 01:47:32,817
Where?

866
01:47:32,818 --> 01:47:34,686
To find $200,000.

867
01:47:36,071 --> 01:47:39,031
I know the name of
the cemetery now,

868
01:47:39,032 --> 01:47:41,610
and you know the name of the grave.

869
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:04,758
You're not gonna give
me the same treatment?

870
01:48:08,395 --> 01:48:09,638
Would you talk?

871
01:48:11,064 --> 01:48:12,683
No, probably not.

872
01:48:14,651 --> 01:48:16,353
That's what I thought.

873
01:48:17,196 --> 01:48:19,405
Not that you're any
tougher than Tuco,

874
01:48:19,406 --> 01:48:22,609
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

875
01:48:26,497 --> 01:48:29,741
And Tuco, is he...

876
01:48:31,793 --> 01:48:33,954
No. Not yet.

877
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:37,290
But he's in very good hands.

878
01:48:38,717 --> 01:48:41,928
You've changed partners, but
you still got the same deal.

879
01:48:41,929 --> 01:48:44,756
I'm not greedy.
I'm only taking half.

880
01:48:45,891 --> 01:48:47,683
There's two of us.

881
01:48:47,684 --> 01:48:49,553
It should make it
easier than just one.

882
01:48:54,691 --> 01:48:56,143
Yeah.

883
01:49:16,004 --> 01:49:19,791
Hold it. That's it, don't move.

884
01:49:20,467 --> 01:49:24,296
Now don't breathe.
Still. That's it.

885
01:49:26,139 --> 01:49:28,175
Got it. Thank you.

886
01:49:43,991 --> 01:49:45,992
Hey, Corporal, afraid
he'll get lost?

887
01:49:45,993 --> 01:49:47,785
Where's the rebel going?

888
01:49:47,786 --> 01:49:51,455
To hell, with a rope around his
neck and a price on his head.

889
01:49:51,456 --> 01:49:53,332
$3,000, friend.

890
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:55,368
That's a lot of money for a head.

891
01:49:56,753 --> 01:49:59,623
I'll bet they didn't even pay
you a penny for your arm.

892
01:50:05,887 --> 01:50:09,473
I told you once, friend,
if I ever get you down,

893
01:50:09,474 --> 01:50:12,719
you're gonna need a lot of
help to get up again. A lot.

894
01:50:32,289 --> 01:50:34,540
You're a lot luckier
than that one there.

895
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:37,209
You get some trouble, rope,
and you're all finished.

896
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:40,121
And there isn't any partner
this time to shoot you down.

897
01:52:22,315 --> 01:52:24,942
If your friends stay
out in the damp,

898
01:52:24,943 --> 01:52:27,486
they're liable to catch
a cold, aren't they?

899
01:52:27,487 --> 01:52:29,189
Or a bullet.

900
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:36,196
Hear that, boys? Come on out here.

901
01:52:48,675 --> 01:52:50,259
Since we're all going
in the same direction,

902
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:52,087
might as well go together.

903
01:52:53,305 --> 01:52:58,601
One, two, three, four,

904
01:52:58,602 --> 01:53:00,971
five, six.

905
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:04,224
Six. Perfect number.

906
01:53:05,942 --> 01:53:07,894
Isn't three the perfect number?

907
01:53:09,905 --> 01:53:12,899
Yeah. But I got six
more bullets in my gun.

908
01:54:16,805 --> 01:54:19,758
Sure would like to put
your paw on it, huh?

909
01:54:21,685 --> 01:54:23,853
I would like to piss. It's rough.

910
01:54:23,854 --> 01:54:26,306
I've been shaken up on this
train nearly ten hours now.

911
01:54:26,439 --> 01:54:29,358
You smell like a pig already,

912
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:31,936
but let's not try to
make things any worse.

913
01:54:34,197 --> 01:54:35,982
Get going.

914
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:47,410
I can't while you're watching me.

915
01:55:10,984 --> 01:55:13,228
You made a lot of
noise, my friend, huh?

916
01:55:34,633 --> 01:55:38,253
You don't want to break our
friendship, huh? Well, I'll break it.

917
01:57:22,866 --> 01:57:24,651
Halt.

918
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:27,695
Take your places.

919
01:57:38,923 --> 01:57:40,500
Ready!

920
01:57:40,884 --> 01:57:43,169
Aim! Fire!

921
01:58:00,403 --> 01:58:02,730
Slim, take care of the horses.

922
02:02:19,078 --> 02:02:21,781
I've been looking for
you for eight months.

923
02:02:22,749 --> 02:02:24,829
Whenever I should've had
a gun in my right hand,

924
02:02:25,793 --> 02:02:27,419
I thought of you.

925
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:31,423
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

926
02:02:31,424 --> 02:02:35,294
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

927
02:02:51,152 --> 02:02:53,479
When you have to shoot,
shoot. Don't talk.

928
02:02:57,367 --> 02:03:00,152
Every gun makes its own tune.

929
02:03:00,953 --> 02:03:03,155
It's perfect timing, Large One.

930
02:03:21,265 --> 02:03:23,676
Clem, follow him.

931
02:04:20,366 --> 02:04:23,493
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

932
02:04:23,494 --> 02:04:26,906
Just give me a little time to
get dressed, and I'll open up.

933
02:04:47,685 --> 02:04:50,096
Put your drawers on and
take your gun off.

934
02:05:01,574 --> 02:05:05,945
Hey, Blondie, how the hell did
you get out of that pigsty?

935
02:05:07,663 --> 02:05:11,659
My own way. I'm here with
your old friend, Angel Eyes.

936
02:05:12,543 --> 02:05:15,788
You talked, you traitor.
You talked.

937
02:05:16,506 --> 02:05:18,165
No, I didn't talk.

938
02:05:18,633 --> 02:05:21,127
If I did, I probably
wouldn't be here now.

939
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:24,797
You, me...

940
02:05:25,556 --> 02:05:28,092
So only you know your
half of the secret?

941
02:05:28,518 --> 02:05:29,719
Mmm-hmm.

942
02:05:33,564 --> 02:05:35,148
Blondie,

943
02:05:35,149 --> 02:05:39,611
I'm very happy you're working with
me, and we're together again.

944
02:05:39,612 --> 02:05:41,947
I get dressed, I kill
him and be right back.

945
02:05:41,948 --> 02:05:45,025
Oh, listen, I forgot to mention,

946
02:05:47,453 --> 02:05:50,281
he's not alone.
There's five of them.

947
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,625
Five?

948
02:05:53,626 --> 02:05:55,035
Yeah, five of them.

949
02:05:58,214 --> 02:06:00,833
So that's why you came to Tuco?

950
02:06:03,886 --> 02:06:06,380
It doesn't matter.
I'll kill them all.

951
02:06:18,276 --> 02:06:20,352
They shot him at close range.

952
02:06:39,964 --> 02:06:42,173
Well, look who's here.

953
02:06:42,174 --> 02:06:44,543
The other one will be along.

954
02:06:46,887 --> 02:06:48,756
They'll come looking for us.

955
02:06:50,516 --> 02:06:52,134
Watch out.

956
02:06:53,019 --> 02:06:54,845
There's two of them.

957
02:06:56,022 --> 02:06:58,224
I want that blond alive.

958
02:07:06,949 --> 02:07:10,569
You, back there. Come on, let's go.

959
02:07:44,445 --> 02:07:46,564
Were you gonna die alone?

960
02:09:37,516 --> 02:09:38,801
Halt!

961
02:10:03,542 --> 02:10:06,836
Hey, Blondie, Angel
Eyes is mine, huh?

962
02:10:06,837 --> 02:10:08,122
All right.

963
02:10:47,711 --> 02:10:49,796
"See you soon..."

964
02:10:52,466 --> 02:10:54,126
"Idiots."

965
02:10:55,094 --> 02:10:56,503
It's for you.

966
02:11:21,537 --> 02:11:24,622
How peaceful and quiet, <i>amigo</i>.

967
02:11:24,623 --> 02:11:27,117
Like a cemetery, for instance?

968
02:11:28,419 --> 02:11:30,788
There should be a bridge
across that river.

969
02:11:31,463 --> 02:11:32,964
We'd better wait for nightfall.

970
02:11:32,965 --> 02:11:34,750
Trust in me, Blondie.

971
02:11:38,137 --> 02:11:39,971
I got a good sense
of where I'm going.

972
02:11:39,972 --> 02:11:41,514
Tuco has taken you this far.

973
02:11:41,515 --> 02:11:43,592
I will take you all the way...

974
02:11:43,934 --> 02:11:45,677
Gentlemen.

975
02:11:48,981 --> 02:11:51,016
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

976
02:11:52,151 --> 02:11:54,269
Come along now. Follow me.

977
02:12:41,283 --> 02:12:43,527
We found them near
the perimeter, sir.

978
02:12:58,342 --> 02:13:00,419
Where do you hail from?

979
02:13:00,552 --> 02:13:01,753
Illinois.

980
02:13:04,515 --> 02:13:06,349
And you?

981
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:08,260
I'm with him.

982
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,977
Any reason for being around here?

983
02:13:17,695 --> 02:13:20,272
We want to enlist, General.

984
02:13:23,075 --> 02:13:25,576
You better learn to
distinguish rank.

985
02:13:25,577 --> 02:13:27,571
I'm a captain.

986
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:30,282
Get the hell out.

987
02:13:32,251 --> 02:13:35,420
It sure as hell might be you
today, so go write your will.

988
02:13:35,421 --> 02:13:36,955
Yes, sir.

989
02:13:41,802 --> 02:13:43,712
So you want to enlist?

990
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:47,424
You gotta take a test to prove it.

991
02:13:56,692 --> 02:13:58,143
Well, show me.

992
02:14:22,134 --> 02:14:23,593
You've got a career.

993
02:14:23,594 --> 02:14:26,512
At the least, I'd say
you'll make colonel.

994
02:14:26,513 --> 02:14:28,382
- Really?
- Sure.

995
02:14:29,308 --> 02:14:33,186
Like it says in the manual,
"You've got every qualification,"

996
02:14:33,187 --> 02:14:36,014
"to become an expert in
the use of weapons."

997
02:14:37,107 --> 02:14:41,478
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war.

998
02:14:44,114 --> 02:14:46,733
The fighting spirit's
in this bottle.

999
02:14:48,619 --> 02:14:50,320
Volunteers.

1000
02:14:52,331 --> 02:14:54,324
You want to enlist?

1001
02:14:55,667 --> 02:14:58,870
Let's go. Come on,
gentlemen. Come on.

1002
02:15:01,757 --> 02:15:04,626
The shooting hasn't begun
yet. We still have time.

1003
02:15:20,692 --> 02:15:23,069
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

1004
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:26,773
and send them to be
slaughtered, is the winner.

1005
02:15:27,533 --> 02:15:32,696
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

1006
02:15:34,206 --> 02:15:36,074
All of us reek of alcohol.

1007
02:15:44,383 --> 02:15:46,418
What did you say your name was?

1008
02:15:49,221 --> 02:15:50,714
And you?

1009
02:15:53,851 --> 02:15:55,052
No.

1010
02:16:00,566 --> 02:16:02,434
Names don't matter.

1011
02:16:03,068 --> 02:16:04,485
Yes, because soon you can join

1012
02:16:04,486 --> 02:16:06,813
the gallant heroes
of Branson Bridge.

1013
02:16:09,032 --> 02:16:10,908
We have two attacks a day.

1014
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:12,785
Two attacks a day?

1015
02:16:12,786 --> 02:16:16,414
Sure, the Rebs have
decided that damn bridge

1016
02:16:16,415 --> 02:16:18,408
is the key to this whole area.

1017
02:16:19,251 --> 02:16:22,211
Stupid, useless bridge.

1018
02:16:22,212 --> 02:16:25,290
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

1019
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:31,797
And headquarters has declared we
must take that ridiculous flyspeck

1020
02:16:33,307 --> 02:16:35,474
even if all of us are killed.

1021
02:16:35,475 --> 02:16:39,971
Otherwise, the key will get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

1022
02:16:41,273 --> 02:16:43,274
And that's not all.

1023
02:16:43,275 --> 02:16:45,943
Both sides want the bridge intact.

1024
02:16:45,944 --> 02:16:50,565
Intact is how the South wants
it, and we want it intact, too.

1025
02:16:53,118 --> 02:16:55,244
You'll all turn to dust,

1026
02:16:55,245 --> 02:17:00,534
but one thing is sure, boys, Branson
Bridge will stand unbroken.

1027
02:17:01,877 --> 02:17:06,164
Is it bad to speak the
way I do to volunteers?

1028
02:17:07,216 --> 02:17:08,834
I've done a lot worse.

1029
02:17:13,722 --> 02:17:17,175
I've done it. I've
blown it up. Boom.

1030
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:21,471
In here, I've destroyed it all.

1031
02:17:22,481 --> 02:17:24,482
It's a court-martial
offense to imagine,

1032
02:17:24,483 --> 02:17:27,985
to dream of blowing
it up. A serious crime.

1033
02:17:27,986 --> 02:17:32,274
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...

1034
02:17:34,993 --> 02:17:37,279
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

1035
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:41,908
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing. Let's
scare the hell out of them.

1036
02:17:45,671 --> 02:17:47,956
I've been dreaming about it.

1037
02:17:51,468 --> 02:17:53,587
I've even worked out a plan.

1038
02:17:55,138 --> 02:17:56,715
I sure have.

1039
02:17:57,849 --> 02:18:00,851
The best time is after the attack

1040
02:18:00,852 --> 02:18:04,014
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

1041
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:09,728
If I could do it, I could
save many thousands of men.

1042
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,569
But what I lack is the guts.

1043
02:18:23,375 --> 02:18:26,585
They're beginning their daily
slaughter right on time.

1044
02:18:26,586 --> 02:18:30,214
Captain, all companies are
awaiting your orders.

1045
02:18:30,215 --> 02:18:31,791
Be right there.

1046
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:46,765
Let's go.

1047
02:18:47,607 --> 02:18:51,645
All right, friends, come along
and enjoy the spectacle.

1048
02:19:23,101 --> 02:19:25,811
Companies, report!

1049
02:19:25,812 --> 02:19:28,814
Company B ready!

1050
02:19:28,815 --> 02:19:31,525
Company E ready!

1051
02:19:31,526 --> 02:19:33,770
Company D ready!

1052
02:19:39,409 --> 02:19:42,779
Companies, forward!

1053
02:20:03,975 --> 02:20:05,226
Hey, Blondie,

1054
02:20:05,227 --> 02:20:08,145
it looks like the captain is really
asking for a bullet in his guts.

1055
02:20:08,146 --> 02:20:09,514
Yeah.

1056
02:21:02,784 --> 02:21:05,904
I've never seen so many
men wasted so badly.

1057
02:21:26,433 --> 02:21:30,261
I have a feeling it's really
gonna be a good, long battle.

1058
02:21:34,232 --> 02:21:36,101
- Blondie?
- Huh?

1059
02:21:36,568 --> 02:21:38,978
The money's on the other
side of the river.

1060
02:21:40,572 --> 02:21:41,981
Where?

1061
02:21:44,409 --> 02:21:47,779
<i>Amigo,</i> I said the other
side, and that's enough.

1062
02:21:48,455 --> 02:21:51,700
But while the Confederates are
there, we can't get across.

1063
02:21:53,168 --> 02:21:57,038
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

1064
02:21:58,548 --> 02:21:59,874
Yeah.

1065
02:22:00,759 --> 02:22:03,712
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

1066
02:22:04,387 --> 02:22:05,797
Maybe.

1067
02:22:43,635 --> 02:22:46,379
Doctor, quick, the
captain's wounded.

1068
02:22:48,932 --> 02:22:50,884
Hurry, a stretcher.

1069
02:22:53,103 --> 02:22:54,846
Easy. Easy now.

1070
02:23:05,657 --> 02:23:07,525
Get things ready.

1071
02:23:28,221 --> 02:23:29,672
A little of this will help.

1072
02:23:36,688 --> 02:23:38,723
Take a slug of this, Captain.

1073
02:23:39,316 --> 02:23:41,309
Keep your ears open.

1074
02:24:29,991 --> 02:24:32,819
What are you doing?
No, leave me alone.

1075
02:26:12,135 --> 02:26:16,130
Blondie, you realize we
might be risking our lives.

1076
02:26:16,806 --> 02:26:19,141
Yeah, and if I get killed,

1077
02:26:19,142 --> 02:26:22,603
you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

1078
02:26:22,604 --> 02:26:24,305
Yeah, Tuco,

1079
02:26:25,356 --> 02:26:27,058
it sure would be a pity.

1080
02:26:57,764 --> 02:26:59,090
Doc.

1081
02:27:01,017 --> 02:27:02,510
Doctor,

1082
02:27:03,144 --> 02:27:05,430
could you help me
live a little more?

1083
02:27:06,022 --> 02:27:07,974
I expect good news.

1084
02:27:58,783 --> 02:28:02,202
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

1085
02:28:02,203 --> 02:28:03,696
Why don't we?

1086
02:28:05,623 --> 02:28:07,283
You go first.

1087
02:28:09,335 --> 02:28:11,579
No, I think it's better that

1088
02:28:14,299 --> 02:28:15,833
you start.

1089
02:28:19,971 --> 02:28:21,506
All right.

1090
02:28:23,683 --> 02:28:25,968
The name of the cemetery is...

1091
02:28:43,953 --> 02:28:45,863
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

1092
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:56,249
The name on the grave is

1093
02:29:00,845 --> 02:29:02,547
Arch Stanton.

1094
02:29:04,474 --> 02:29:07,552
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?

1095
02:29:08,686 --> 02:29:10,680
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.

1096
02:40:59,146 --> 02:41:01,682
It'll be a lot easier with that.

1097
02:41:41,772 --> 02:41:44,732
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

1098
02:41:44,733 --> 02:41:46,018
Dig.

1099
02:41:48,862 --> 02:41:50,439
You're not digging.

1100
02:42:02,751 --> 02:42:06,038
If you shoot me, you won't
see a cent of that money.

1101
02:42:08,006 --> 02:42:09,291
Why?

1102
02:42:12,302 --> 02:42:14,171
I'll tell you why.

1103
02:42:15,097 --> 02:42:17,049
'Cause there's nothing in there.

1104
02:42:25,524 --> 02:42:27,066
Why, you son of a...

1105
02:42:27,067 --> 02:42:28,810
You thought I'd trust you?

1106
02:42:32,197 --> 02:42:34,316
$200,000 is a lot of money.

1107
02:42:36,201 --> 02:42:38,195
We're gonna have to earn it.

1108
02:42:41,665 --> 02:42:42,950
How?

1109
02:42:54,303 --> 02:42:56,713
I'll write the name on the
bottom of this stone.

1110
02:43:00,976 --> 02:43:02,427
The gun.

1111
02:49:08,885 --> 02:49:12,630
You pig. You want to get me
killed? When'd you unload it?

1112
02:49:14,724 --> 02:49:16,343
Last night.

1113
02:49:17,269 --> 02:49:22,064
You see, in this world, there's
two kinds of people, my friend,

1114
02:49:22,065 --> 02:49:26,269
those with loaded guns,
and those who dig.

1115
02:49:26,736 --> 02:49:28,063
You dig.

1116
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:29,856
Where?

1117
02:49:40,625 --> 02:49:41,951
Here.

1118
02:49:46,131 --> 02:49:47,874
There's no name on it!

1119
02:49:49,259 --> 02:49:51,336
There's no name here either.

1120
02:49:53,096 --> 02:49:56,015
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

1121
02:49:56,016 --> 02:50:00,178
It was the grave marked "Unknown"
right beside Arch Stanton.

1122
02:50:07,736 --> 02:50:09,521
Go ahead.

1123
02:51:07,170 --> 02:51:09,914
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie.

1124
02:51:26,648 --> 02:51:27,856
You're joking, Blondie.

1125
02:51:27,857 --> 02:51:30,810
You wouldn't play a
joke on me like that.

1126
02:51:31,987 --> 02:51:34,522
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

1127
02:51:35,198 --> 02:51:38,359
Now I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

1128
02:52:45,727 --> 02:52:50,014
Well, now, seems just like old times.

1129
02:52:54,194 --> 02:52:56,312
Four for you

1130
02:52:57,781 --> 02:52:59,566
and four...

1131
02:53:02,619 --> 02:53:04,237
Four for me.

1132
02:53:42,826 --> 02:53:45,695
Hey, Blondie.

1133
02:53:46,663 --> 02:53:48,323
Sorry, Tuco.

1134
02:53:52,502 --> 02:53:53,703
Blondie...

1135
02:54:02,929 --> 02:54:06,049
Blondie!

1136
02:54:25,034 --> 02:54:26,235
Blondie.

1137
02:54:53,897 --> 02:54:56,933
Blondie!

1138
02:55:23,009 --> 02:55:24,544
Blondie!

1139
02:56:24,529 --> 02:56:26,689
Hey, Blondie!

1140
02:56:28,533 --> 02:56:31,652
You know what you are?

1141
02:56:34,977 --> 02:56:38,293
Just a dirty son of a bitch!
