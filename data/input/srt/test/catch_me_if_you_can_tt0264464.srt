an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

daring con man in U.S. history.

In the Iast few weeks,

l'm calling "The Float."

624
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,205
What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,

625
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,792
then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

635

And then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actuaIIy mean something?

641
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,635
AII of this was in the report I fiIed
two days ago. If you change

642
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,056
a 02 to a 1 2, that means that check,

643
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,474
which was cashed in New York,

644
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,018
does not go
to the New York FederaI Branch,

645
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:10,439
but it is re-routed aII the way
to the San Francisco FederaI Branch.

646
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,025
The bank doesn't even know
the check has bounced for two weeks.

647
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,736
Which means our unsub

02:09:37,687 --> 02:09:41,064
-You're going to see Grace?
-Yeah, that's the pIan.

1839
02:09:44,735 --> 02:09:46,778
What shouId I do tiII Monday?

02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:50,198
I'm sorry, kid, I can't heIp you there.
Excuse me.

(PHONE RINGING)

1842
02:09:56,539 --> 02:09:58,248
This is Hanratty.

1843
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:00,709
Yeah, put him on.

1844
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:10,260
Mr. Sawyer.

1845
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,429
How are you?

1846
02:10:12,722 --> 02:10:16,600
I have haIf a dozen more checks

(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

1848
02:10:56,933 --> 02:10:58,934
How did you do it, Frank?

1849
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:03,438
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

1850
02:11:03,523 --> 02:11:05,607
What are you doing here?

1851
02:11:06,275 --> 02:11:07,484
Listen.

1852
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:10,111
I'm sorry I put you through aII this.

1853
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:12,989
You go back to Europe,
you'II die in Perpignan Prison.

1854
02:11:13,074 --> 02:11:14,032
You try to run here in the States,

1855
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:17,452
we'II send you back to AtIanta
for 50 years.

1856
02:11:17,537 --> 02:11:18,995
I know that.

1857
02:11:20,665 --> 02:11:23,166
I spent four years
trying to arrange your reIease.

1858
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,085
I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.

1859
02:11:25,169 --> 02:11:28,046
and the Attorney GeneraI
of the United States you wouIdn't run.

1860
02:11:28,548 --> 02:11:30,298
Why did you do it?

1861
02:11:31,008 --> 02:11:33,718
-You're just a kid.
-I'm not your kid.

1862
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,513
You said you were going to Chicago.

1863
02:11:36,681 --> 02:11:40,475
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

1864
02:11:41,018 --> 02:11:43,311
You said she was four years oId.
You're Iying.

1865
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:46,189
She was four when I Ieft. Now she's 1 5.

1866
02:11:46,691 --> 02:11:49,568
My wife has been remarried
for 1 1 years.

1867
02:11:49,652 --> 02:11:52,070
I see Grace every now and again.

1868
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:55,323
-I don't understand.
-Sure you do.

1869
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:58,868
Sometimes it's easier Iiving the Iie.

1870
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:04,499
I'm gonna Iet you fIy tonight, Frank.

1871
02:12:05,334 --> 02:12:09,504
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'II be back on Monday.

1872
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:10,755
Yeah.

1873

-How do you know I'II come back?
-(CHUCKLES)

1874
02:12:16,053 --> 02:12:17,178
Look.

1875
02:12:18,222 --> 02:12:19,389
Frank.

1876
02:12:19,724 --> 02:12:21,683
Nobody is chasing you.

1877
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:44,539
AIice, has he stiII not caIIed?

1878
02:12:44,624 --> 02:12:46,207
No, he hasn't.

1879
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,012
CARL: Good morning.

1880
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,139
I've caIIed this meeting to discuss

1881
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:03,558
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting.

1882
02:13:03,643 --> 02:13:05,852
The unsub is washing
and aItering checks,

1883
02:13:05,936 --> 02:13:07,520
then passing them throughout Arizona.

1884
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:16,363
This unsub is a big dog,
passing checks as Iarge as five figures.

1885
02:13:16,447 --> 02:13:18,073
(DOOR OPENING)

1886
02:13:19,784 --> 02:13:21,409
Sorry I'm Iate.

1887
02:13:22,703 --> 02:13:23,912
Sorry.

1888
02:13:28,125 --> 02:13:31,002
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

1889
02:13:31,087 --> 02:13:33,797
Why don't we step out to the buIIpen?

1890
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,762
There's impressions on every Iine.

1891
02:13:42,431 --> 02:13:45,433
Looks Iike the originaI amount
was for $60.

1892
02:13:48,979 --> 02:13:50,897
Mind if I take a Iook?

1893
02:13:53,984 --> 02:13:56,403
Cashed in FIagstaff a week ago.

1894
02:13:59,156 --> 02:14:01,241
Cost the bank $1 6,000.

1895
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:04,953
-It's a reaI check.
-Yeah.

1896
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:09,040
It's been washed.
The onIy thing originaI is the signature.

1897
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:10,834
But it's perfect.

1898
02:14:11,252 --> 02:14:14,170
I mean, this isn't hydrochIoride
or bIeach.

1899
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:15,463
No.

1900
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:17,132
Something new.

1901
02:14:17,299 --> 02:14:22,303
A naiI poIish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

1902
02:14:25,433 --> 02:14:27,225
How did you do it, Frank?

1903
02:14:28,644 --> 02:14:31,813
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1904
02:14:36,986 --> 02:14:38,611
I didn't cheat.

1905
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:42,866
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

1906
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:48,705
Is that the truth?

1907
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:51,958
I'II bet this guy steaIs checks
out of maiIboxes.

1908
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:55,170
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

1909
02:14:56,630 --> 02:14:58,757
You're saying he's a IocaI?

1910
02:14:58,841 --> 02:15:02,594
If it were me, I'd caII the bank first.
Check out the baIance...

1911
02:15:02,678 --> 02:15:04,971
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your whiIe.

1912
02:15:05,055 --> 02:15:06,181
ExactIy.

1913
02:15:06,515 --> 02:15:09,517
You know, CarI, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

1914
02:15:10,019 --> 02:15:12,395
Guess aII we have to do now
is catch him.
