1
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,838
September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.

2
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,637
Damn tramps.

3
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:04,062
Watch it!

4
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:06,567
Disgusting!

5
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,074
Is he dead?

6
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:10,304
The Americans'll be arriving
any day now.

7
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:13,347
It's disgraceful,
having these bums here!

8
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,526
Mama...!

9
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:29,352
What day is it?

10
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,374
Setsuko...

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,318
Another one.

12
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,261
What is this stuff?

13
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:12,340
Never mind. Just dump it!

14
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,054
This one's a goner, too.

15
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:30,124
You can see it in their eyes.

00:04:56,638 --> 00:05:00,199
Air raid!
Get to the shelters!

25
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,778
We're in for a big one!

26
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,213
The shelter behind the firehouse
should be safest!

27
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,818
It's hot!

28
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:17,119
Be a good girl.
Try to be patient.

29
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:24,428
I'd better get over to the shelter.

30
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,969
Be careful, and get over there
as soon as you can.

31
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,103
Setsuko, be a good girl
and mind your brother.

32
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,400
Never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

33
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,635
Yes, yes.

34
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,811
Mom, do you have your medicine?

35
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:41,781
Right here. Don't worry.

36
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,655
I hate the shelter!

37
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:51,192
Well, you'll be sorry
if you get blown up by a bomb!

38
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,282
Now get on.

39
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,268
My doll!

40
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:14,307
Air raid!

41
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,384
Seita!

42
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,932
Get down!

43
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,062
Seita!

44
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,007
Seita!

45
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:49,820
Long live the Emperor!

46
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:13,521
We're safe here. Don't worry.

47
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,184
Where's Mama?

48
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,760
In the shelter.

49
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:24,831
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250-kilo bomb easy.

50
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,423
Don't worry about her.

51
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:41,378
She'll probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us.

52
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,542
We'll meet her there.

53
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,753
Let's just catch our breath first.

54
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,460
Are you okay, Setsuko?

55
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:57,531
I lost one of my shoes.

56
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,036
I'll buy you better ones.

57
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,801
I have money.

58
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,877
Open this.

59
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,056
Wow, you're rich.

60
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:38,500
Black rain, from the bombing.

61
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,580
It's all gone!

62
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:27,085
Look, that was the civic hall.
We ate lunch there, once.

63
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:32,089
Is our house gone too?

64
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:33,626
Probably.

65
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,094
What'll we do?

66
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,195
Dad'll make them pay for this!

67
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:57,051
Mother!

68
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:10,854
Well, it's not like I was
the only one who lost his house.

69
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,195
We're all in the same boat.

70
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:20,374
At least we're still alive.

71
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,278
There were two direct hits.
The fires are impossible to put out!

72
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,817
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

73
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:32,478
It's not her.
She's not down here!

74
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:38,926
Seita, I have to pee.

75
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:54,800
All residents of
Ichirizuka and Kaminishi!

76
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:00,711
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

77
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:01,782
What's wrong?

78
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,316
My eye hurts.

79
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,386
Don't rub it.

80
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,651
We'll get it washed out
at the school.

81
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,350
Where's Mama?

82
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,359
- She'll be at the school.
- School?

83
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:16,055
Uh-huh. Let's go.

84
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,748
Seita!

85
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:38,809
Have you seen your mom?

86
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:41,979
She's hurt.
You'd better go.

87
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,582
I'll watch your sister.

88
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,593
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?
Did you cry?

89
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,759
Seita has to go somewhere.
Why don't we wait for him?

90
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:03,771
Seita. I've been looking for you.
Are you okay?

91
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,778
- My mom...?
- This way.

92
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,456
This IS your mother's,
isn't it?

93
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,062
In here.

94
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,868
She's finally asleep.

95
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:43,773
She really should be
in a proper hospital.

96
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,581
I think Kaisei hospital
in Nishinomiya wasn't hit.

97
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,823
My mother has heart trouble.
Can she get her medicine?

98
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll ask.

99
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,462
I'll be around
if you need me.

100
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,909
Mom...

101
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,560
You saw her?

102
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,001
It's terrible.

103
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,633
I'm thirsty.

104
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,710
If there's anything I can do,
just ask.

105
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:50,012
Oh, did you get
your biscuit ration yet?

106
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,586
I'll get it for you!

107
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,960
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it.

108
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,965
Mom's hurt.
She'll get better, though.

109
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:14,264
Where is she?

110
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:17,310
In the hospital. In Nishinomiya.

111
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:25,342
We'll stay here
at the school tonight.

112
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:29,822
Then tomorrow we'll go to our
aunt's place in Nishinomiya.

113
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,325
Okay?

114
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:47,474
We'll all be on the second floor.
Why don't you stop by later?

115
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,273
Thanks a lot. We will.

116
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,582
See you later, Setsuko.

117
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,849
Want some?

118
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,719
I want to see Mama.

119
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,788
Maybe tomorrow.
It's too late now.

120
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,449
Watch me,
I'm good at this!

121
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,907
We haven't unbandaged her.
You don't want to see the body.

122
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:34,604
With this heat we're having,
she'll have to go on the truck today.

123
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,960
Where's your sister?

124
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,401
In Nishinomiya.
We have a distant aunt there.

125
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:00,133
I think she'll take care of us.

126
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,801
I see. Lucky for you.

127
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,313
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

128
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,498
Mama!

129
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:39,164
Where is she?

130
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:42,106
Is she still sick?

131
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,177
Yeah. Still sick.

132
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:46,246
Welcome back.

133
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:51,078
How's your mother?
Is she at Kaisei?

134
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,155
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

135
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:59,920
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

136
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:04,021
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

137
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:05,530
Thanks.

138
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:17,044
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

139
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,340
Did she give it to me?

140
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,049
Just be careful
you don't lose it.

141
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:37,630
Mom's...

142
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,962
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

143
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,902
Time for bed. Okay?

144
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:45,387
Dried bonito, herring,
dried potato, eggs,

145
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:47,892
and pickled plums.

146
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:51,560
And I do believe this is butter!

147
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,726
You can't get these
for ANYTHI NG nowadays.

148
00:24:57,137 --> 00:25:00,106
Soldiers always get the best
at times like these.

149
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,441
Anyway, did you
stop by the hospital?

150
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,144
I'd like to tell your mother
what's been happening.

151
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:11,218
And I could take Setsuko along
to visit her.

152
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:14,812
That bad?!

153
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:18,358
Mom died while she was
still at the school.

154
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,428
What?! She's dead!

155
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:28,632
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why were you hiding it?!

156
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,762
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

157
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,099
Dead... How awful!

158
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:41,448
You'd best write your father
and tell him!

159
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,212
Seita!

160
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:52,451
Look!
She bought me new shoes!

161
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,087
Good for you, Setsuko.

162
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,959
Hello there!

163
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:18,581
You poor dears.

164
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:20,654
Thanks, ma'am.

165
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,918
What's that?

166
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:29,922
Bullfrogs.
Nothing to be scared of.

167
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,827
Firefly!

168
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,807
Try to catch it.

169
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,614
Whoops! Squashed it.

170
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:51,150
Ew! It smells!

171
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,711
You squeezed too hard.

172
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:24,745
There're millions of them!

173
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:40,456
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "ah."

174
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,000
Why?

175
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:43,831
Just do it. "Ah."

176
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,843
Fruit drop!

177
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:01,579
Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

178
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,533
I almost swallowed it.

179
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,879
- We're home.
- Where were you?

180
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:40,055
Did you thank the lady?

181
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,650
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:46,325
That food looked good.

183
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:18,554
Seita. Shouldn't you be
going to school?

184
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:19,996
Or something?

185
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,628
Yeah, but the steelworks
they had me working in was bombed.

186
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:27,969
And my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

187
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:31,701
Well, I hope
you've written to your father.

188
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,679
I already sent a letter
through the Naval Office.

189
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,180
When?

190
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:39,184
Just after we came here.
About 10 days ago?

191
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:42,655
That's strange.

192
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,984
There should have been
a reply by now.

193
00:29:47,728 --> 00:29:51,255
Return the scissors when you've
finished with them, Setsuko.

194
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:01,436
How's the war effort?

195
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:04,443
It's starting to look hopeless.

196
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,372
The more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

197
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,882
We're getting ready for
when they finally invade.

198
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,282
You're right. That's why food's
getting so hard to find.

199
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:23,722
Our soldiers aren't the only ones
who are suffering.

200
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:28,359
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

201
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:32,032
You eat up and work
as hard as you can!

202
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,145
Not again.

203
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,144
So you've taken in
a couple of homeless children?

204
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:50,121
Poor things. To lose their
mother when they're so young.

205
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,654
What's wrong? Itch?

206
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,092
It's hot. I hate shelters!

207
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:59,563
Just hang on. Don't worry,
I'm here for you.

208
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,478
Wanna go to the beach?

209
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,275
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go!

210
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:33,191
It's all vegetable fields now.

211
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,385
What're they doing?

212
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:35,523
Making sea salt.

213
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:39,030
It's because all the salt
and soy sauce is rationed.

214
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,691
Hurry up, Setsuko!

215
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:12,662
It might be a little cold.

216
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:14,324
Cold!

217
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:19,633
Feels good, right?
You won't itch now.

218
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:29,941
It's a big bathtub!

219
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:31,545
HEY!

220
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:39,189
Come back here!

221
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,124
Grrr, I'm a bear!
I'm gonna eat you!

222
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:13,622
Snip... Snip... Snip...

223
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:21,227
What's wrong?
Is he sleeping?

224
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:32,111
Don't look at that.

225
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:38,109
When it gets a little warmer,
I'll teach you how to swim.

226
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:43,322
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

227
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,058
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

228
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,029
Seita!

229
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,732
Setsuko! Come on!

230
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:12,009
You're hungry, aren't you?

231
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:15,576
There's food here for you.

232
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,918
Mother! Were you waiting long?
It's good to see you again.

233
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,426
Are you alright here?

234
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,984
I'm fine. Don't worry!
They're very nice here.

235
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:59,031
I'm hungry.

236
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,364
Let's get home
before we're caught in the raid.

237
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:07,702
I'm tired. Carry me.

238
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,707
Air raid!

239
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:26,291
Your mother won't be needing
her kimonos anymore.

240
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,953
Why don't you trade them
for some rice.

241
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:34,398
I've been trading off my things
bit by bit for food.

242
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,730
<i>You can probably get
a full toh of rice for them.</i>

243
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:38,929
That much?

244
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,007
You need your nourishment.

245
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:44,406
You can't be a soldier
if you don't grow up healthy.

246
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,477
<i>A whole toh of rice?</i>

247
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,811
Your mother would be glad
you didn't just let them go to waste.

248
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,181
Why don't I take them?

249
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,087
NO!

250
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:57,714
Setsuko. You're awake?

251
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:02,454
No! No! They're Mama's!

252
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:05,664
They're Mama's!
Don't take them!

253
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,497
Setsuko. Let them go!

254
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:15,000
Setsuko. Setsuko.

255
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,479
Fine rice, isn't it?

256
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:02,677
We'll have a proper
rice dinner tonight, Setsuko.

257
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,820
Here, this is yours.

258
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:18,129
White rice, Setsuko!

259
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:31,414
Here you go.

260
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:35,184
With my daughter and our lodger
working overtime so much...

261
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:38,155
I've felt bad
not having rice to give them.

262
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,491
It's great, huh?
Real white rice!

263
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:47,232
More!

264
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,028
Yes, yes.

265
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:55,465
You're just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you, Setsuko?

266
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:56,940
It's good!

267
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,372
What's wrong?

268
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:07,214
I don't want rice porridge!

269
00:39:07,754 --> 00:39:10,052
Don't we have
any more pickled plums?

270
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,284
We finished those off ages ago.

271
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,861
Here's your lunch.

272
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:18,897
- Thanks. I'd better get going.
- See you.

273
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,698
- Bye.
- Take care.

274
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:27,034
We'll have rice balls for lunch.
Just hold on 'til then.

275
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,099
Stop that!
You'll have it for lunch too!

276
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:34,711
You think
a lazy slug like you deserves...

277
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:38,716
the same as people
who work for our nation?!

278
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:45,891
Seita, you're old enough to know
everyone has to cooperate.

279
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:49,989
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you earn it?

280
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,496
No, you absolutely do not!

281
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:06,946
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

282
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:09,606
But it's our rice.

283
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:13,246
Oh, so now
I'm cheating you, am I?

284
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:18,757
How dare you say that!
After I take you two in!

285
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:21,420
Fine!

286
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:26,522
We'll just make our
OWN dinners from now on!

287
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:31,036
Seita, you have other relatives
in Tokyo, don't you?

288
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,163
On your mother's side of the family?

289
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:39,871
Why not write to them?
WE could be bombed any day!

290
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,277
Problem is,
I don't know their address.

291
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:52,748
Let's go home.

292
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:56,056
Uh-huh. Papa's waiting for us.

293
00:40:56,296 --> 00:41:01,199
Frogs are singing,
it's time to go home

294
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:07,768
Sorry you had to wait so long.

295
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,835
What's wrong?

296
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:16,109
I'm hungry.
And I'm thirsty too.

297
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:17,808
Okay.

298
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:24,222
Here, have a fruit drop.

299
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,456
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

300
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:34,430
7000. That's enough to live on,
so don't worry.

301
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:42,067
I'm telling Dad to write back soon,
because you're waiting.

302
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:54,153
You're in luck.

303
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:59,619
You can't buy a stove
like this easily nowadays.

304
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:05,731
It's almost impossible to find
any hardware to sell.

305
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,269
I'll take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

306
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:15,398
An umbrella... Oh, yes!

307
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:19,637
It's raining, it's raining

308
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:25,616
Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me

309
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:29,848
Drip-drop, plip-plop
Down the rain comes!

310
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,734
That's got it!

311
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:45,667
Be careful with that fire.

312
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,501
Right.

313
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:52,240
What are they up to?

314
00:42:52,345 --> 00:42:54,779
They're doing their own cooking.

315
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:58,749
Good for them!
More, please.

316
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:01,684
Mother,
did you scold them again?

317
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,022
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

318
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:09,356
And that boy even bought a stove.
Just to spite me!

319
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:12,464
Finished!

320
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,960
Bad manners, Seita.

321
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:23,834
Doesn't matter.
We can sit any way we want.

322
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:35,150
Rice for two.

323
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:36,744
That's it?

324
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:40,292
Next ration will be in July.

325
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,318
Let me!

326
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:44,749
Like it?

327
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:54,289
It's all different tastes!

328
00:45:54,393 --> 00:45:59,262
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint.
All in there. Drink it all.

329
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:12,376
All gone.

330
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:19,750
Great.
Left the dishes for me to do.

331
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,352
So selfish.

332
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,429
Honestly!
Those brats are two of the worst!

333
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:28,332
Not again!

334
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,990
Mama!

335
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:33,867
Seita, my daughter and
that man work for our nation!

336
00:46:33,972 --> 00:46:37,237
We can't have her crying
keeping them awake.

337
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:42,575
We've enough trouble
getting sleep with the air raids!

338
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:13,737
Report from
Central Military Division.

339
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:18,714
Several waves of
enemy bombers are approaching.

340
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:21,308
Going to the shelter again, Seita?

341
00:47:21,419 --> 00:47:26,152
You're old enough to
help fight the fires, aren't you?

342
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:43,001
I want to go home.
I hate living with her!

343
00:47:44,843 --> 00:47:47,744
We don't have a house
to go back to.

344
00:48:00,926 --> 00:48:05,954
With a great big streamer
shaped like a carp

345
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:08,089
And longer than a house

346
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:12,228
The big one's the Papa

347
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,938
The little ones the kids

348
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,507
Stop it!

349
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:19,270
Don't you realize
there's a war going on?!

350
00:48:19,377 --> 00:48:21,504
You two are nothing
but trouble for me!

351
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:26,015
A couple of pests,
that's what you are!

352
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:29,951
You're no help at all
during the raids.

353
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:34,515
You could just go and LIVE in
that shelter for all I care!

354
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,562
That's it.

355
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,597
We'll live here.

356
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:49,466
No one uses it. It's sturdy.
We can live like we want!

357
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:52,737
Can we really live here?!

358
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:20,334
We've bothered you long enough.
We're leaving now.

359
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:22,804
Leaving...? For where?

360
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:25,603
Haven't really decided yet.

361
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:30,946
Well, take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye, Setsuko!

362
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:54,232
This'll be the kitchen!

363
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:58,609
This'll be the front door!

364
00:50:00,412 --> 00:50:03,108
Where's the bathroom?

365
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:08,477
That can be anywhere.
Wanna go somewhere with me?

366
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:19,428
Thanks for the wagon.

367
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,829
Just leave it there.

368
00:50:23,168 --> 00:50:28,367
Do you think you can sell us
some food and straw?

369
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,373
I guess.
Not much left, though.

370
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:30,191
- My mouth's watering!
- Man, am I hungry.

371
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:59,126
Well, we can always eat frogs.

372
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,027
Frogs?

373
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,464
They're great.

374
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:08,870
You'd better get
under the mosquito net.

375
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,447
What's wrong?

376
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,417
I forgot my toothbrush.

377
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,489
One night without it
won't matter.

378
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:32,427
It's getting buggy.
You'd better get under the net.

379
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,499
It's dark in there. I'm scared.

380
00:52:39,804 --> 00:52:42,898
I have to take a leak.
How about you?

381
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:50,014
A kamikaze.

382
00:52:50,682 --> 00:52:52,582
It looks like a firefly.

383
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,652
Yeah.

384
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,451
Let's catch some.

385
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,091
Okay, get in.

386
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,766
I can see you!

387
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:18,466
I can see you, too.

388
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,772
A hair clip.

389
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:31,750
Okay, let's get
as many as we can!

390
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,842
I went to a naval review once.
Before you were born.

391
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:31,778
Naval review...?

392
00:54:31,883 --> 00:54:37,344
Uh-huh. Dad's cruiser, the "Maya,"
was in formation with the fleet.

393
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:18,322
Mighty fortresses
floating on the seas

394
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:22,388
Defending our homeland
from invaders near and far

395
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,468
Enemy plane!

396
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:39,073
I wonder
where Dad is fighting now.

397
00:56:07,645 --> 00:56:10,443
Get off me, Seita!

398
00:56:48,553 --> 00:56:49,520
Whatcha doing?

399
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:54,455
Making a grave.
Mama's in a grave too.

400
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:02,732
Auntie told me.

401
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:08,033
She said Mama died,
and she's in a grave now.

402
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:40,497
We'll visit her grave sometime.

403
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:45,838
Do you remember the graveyard,
the one near Nunobiki?

404
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:51,472
That's where she is.
Under a big camphor tree.

405
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:55,712
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

406
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:36,482
Hey, it looks like
somebody's living here.

407
00:58:36,594 --> 00:58:38,323
Probably lost their house.

408
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:41,464
Maybe it's some crazy hermit.

409
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,194
It's a swing.

410
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:46,133
A kid lives here.
What's this?

411
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:49,265
Rest in Peace!

412
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:53,967
Wish it was real food.

413
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:57,171
It says "Setsuko."

414
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,476
Look! Dried frogs!

415
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:01,677
Who'd wanna eat that?!

416
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:06,246
Nobody I know
would ever eat this stuff!

417
00:59:08,092 --> 00:59:09,582
Ground soybeans!

418
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:12,026
And I thought
the food I got was bad!

419
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:14,427
A ghost!

420
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:30,236
I've traded everything for rice.
Even my mom's kimono.

421
00:59:30,348 --> 00:59:32,248
There's nothing left to trade.

422
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,615
Please, I can pay you money
for the rice.

423
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:39,688
Sorry. I can't trade
or sell anything to you.

424
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:44,124
I'm a farmer, but even
I don't have any rice to share.

425
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:53,528
Don't you have other relatives?

426
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:55,333
I can't contact them.

427
00:59:55,673 --> 00:59:59,632
Then take my advice
and go back to that woman.

428
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:03,004
Everything's rationed now.

429
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:05,947
You can't survive
outside of the system.

430
01:00:06,617 --> 01:00:09,586
Just swallow your pride
and apologize to her.

431
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,093
Thanks, anyway.
I'll ask someone else.

432
01:00:20,464 --> 01:00:24,366
You're a navy man's son, right?
Try to be brave.

433
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,268
Should we?

434
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,509
Uh-oh!

435
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,705
It doesn't matter
if you like it or not.

436
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:43,774
You have to eat!

437
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:46,206
You need to,
so you can grow up!

438
01:02:46,477 --> 01:02:47,739
Seita...

439
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,417
I-I feel funny.

440
01:02:54,518 --> 01:02:56,850
Are you cold?

441
01:02:56,954 --> 01:03:00,390
I've been having diarrhea.

442
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:04,919
Why you...!

443
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:08,127
I'm sorry!

444
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:11,768
Sir, forgive me!
I didn't mean to.

445
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:16,335
My sister's sick. I just wanted
to get her some sugar!

446
01:03:16,442 --> 01:03:20,902
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

447
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:25,239
You god damned...!
Come back here!

448
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:39,659
What the hell...?!
Potatoes too?!

449
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,535
So YOU'RE the one who's
been stealing around here!

450
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:45,603
Seita!

451
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:50,032
I'm sorry!
I'll never do it again, I swear!

452
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:53,475
Tell it to the cops!
I'll take you there myself!

453
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:55,243
Now walk!
I hope they lock you up!

454
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:59,479
Please, she's sick!
She needs me!

455
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:04,214
Seita!

456
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:06,549
SEITA!

457
01:04:08,627 --> 01:04:11,562
Seita...

458
01:04:16,935 --> 01:04:20,735
The nature of the crime is
fairly clear, I think.

459
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:24,206
Thank you, I'll handle this.
You may go.

460
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,607
But, officer...

461
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:30,537
You've knocked
this poor kid around enough.

462
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,684
I'm even tempted to call it...

463
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:35,253
ASSAULT!

464
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,314
I... er... Thank you, officer!

465
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,188
They hit Fukui tonight.

466
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,630
Would you like a glass of water?

467
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:02,246
Setsuko.

468
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,489
Seita!

469
01:05:28,006 --> 01:05:29,667
Seita.

470
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:42,151
Where does it hurt?
Should I get a doctor?

471
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,427
Setsuko!

472
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,672
Seita, I have to
go to the bathroom.

473
01:06:04,142 --> 01:06:06,440
Can it wait?

474
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:09,180
Hop on.

475
01:06:16,855 --> 01:06:22,794
Brother's gone to the mountain
to bring back some firewood...

476
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,178
Setsuko. Dinner.

477
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:22,615
This pumpkin's great.
Tastes just like sweet bean jelly.

478
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,246
Don't like that stuff.

479
01:07:25,357 --> 01:07:30,454
Look, if you don't eat,
Dad'll blame ME for it.

480
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:34,521
Come on, I'll even help you.
Now cheer up and eat!

481
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:41,029
Once you get better,
I'll take you to the beach again.

482
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:19,630
Now I'll really get you
something good to eat, Setsuko!

483
01:09:29,214 --> 01:09:30,681
Seita...

484
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:38,522
Seita...

485
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,326
These were your mother's?
Don't make me laugh!

486
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:48,127
Don't try to pawn off
this garbage on me!

487
01:09:57,442 --> 01:10:01,003
Setsuko.

488
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:29,898
Setsuko!

489
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:40,443
Seita... Water...

490
01:10:51,096 --> 01:10:52,358
Breathe in.

491
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:54,957
And out.

492
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:01,435
She's been having diarrhea
for a while now.

493
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:07,206
Prickly heat, rashes...
And salt water hurts her skin.

494
01:11:09,915 --> 01:11:14,443
Weakening from malnutrition.
Probably due to the diarrhea.

495
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:15,918
Next?

496
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,921
Can you give her medicine?
A shot?

497
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:20,287
Don't wanna shot.

498
01:11:20,392 --> 01:11:23,452
Please, doctor, help her!

499
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:29,428
Medicine?
All this child needs is food.

500
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:31,229
Food...

501
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,694
What's wrong?

502
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:36,205
Where do I GET food?!

503
01:12:24,723 --> 01:12:29,126
Boy, am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

504
01:12:29,227 --> 01:12:34,824
Tempura, sashimi, jelly...

505
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,127
Anything else?

506
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:40,295
Ice cream. And also...

507
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:43,333
I want fruit drops.

508
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:46,274
Drops? Okay!

509
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:53,577
I'll withdraw the money and
buy you all the food you need.

510
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:58,520
Don't want anything.
You can have it.

511
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:04,523
Don't go! Stay with me!
Don't leave me alone!

512
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:08,230
Don't worry, Setsuko.

513
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:12,497
I'll buy you some good,
nourishing food.

514
01:13:13,038 --> 01:13:17,873
And I'll never leave you again.
Never, ever again.

515
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:22,013
I promise.

516
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:44,493
3000 yen.

517
01:13:44,602 --> 01:13:46,695
There's a typhoon coming?

518
01:13:46,805 --> 01:13:52,141
Great, we get our "divine wind"
AFTER we surrender. Figures...

519
01:13:52,243 --> 01:13:55,576
Surrender...?
We've lost the war?!

520
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:58,212
Haven't you heard?

521
01:14:01,586 --> 01:14:04,851
Japan's lost?
The Great Japanese Empire?

522
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:07,925
Yeah.
Surrendered unconditionally.

523
01:14:09,294 --> 01:14:10,989
What about the fleet?

524
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:12,085
All gone.

525
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,792
Sent to the bottom.
Not one left afloat.

526
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,162
WHAT?!

527
01:14:17,268 --> 01:14:21,602
Was my Dad's ship sunken, too?!
Is that why he hasn't written?!

528
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:24,140
How should I know?

529
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,367
Crazy kid.

530
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:32,311
Damn him!

531
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:51,058
I'm so hungry.

532
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:57,165
Dad.

533
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:06,680
Now Dad's gone too.

534
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:10,048
He's dead too.

535
01:15:11,856 --> 01:15:13,517
Dad...

536
01:15:56,267 --> 01:16:01,068
Sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you some rice.

537
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:03,874
Up they go.

538
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:08,076
And down again.

539
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:12,806
Oh. Firefly's stopped.

540
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:15,886
I bought us
some chicken and eggs.

541
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:20,091
And also...

542
01:16:28,433 --> 01:16:30,901
Setsuko,
what's in your mouth?!

543
01:16:34,873 --> 01:16:37,774
This is a marble.
It isn't a drop!

544
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:44,270
I brought you something
I know you like.

545
01:16:47,318 --> 01:16:50,219
Seita. Have one.

546
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:56,588
Setsuko. What's...?

547
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,459
Rice balls.

548
01:17:00,565 --> 01:17:03,728
I made them for you.

549
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:08,068
Here. Have one.

550
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,176
You don't want them...?

551
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,577
Setsuko!

552
01:17:26,324 --> 01:17:30,283
Look, it's a watermelon.
I didn't steal it, either.

553
01:17:42,273 --> 01:17:45,106
Here, eat it.

554
01:17:52,283 --> 01:17:54,251
It's good...

555
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:02,486
Hold on, I'll make you some
rice gruel with eggs.

556
01:18:09,734 --> 01:18:12,567
I'll leave the melon here for you.

557
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:14,902
Okay?

558
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,001
Seita.

559
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:21,310
Thank you.

560
01:18:45,136 --> 01:18:48,867
She never woke up.

561
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,791
There.
Charcoal for the cremation.

562
01:19:44,262 --> 01:19:47,322
Since it's a child,
you should do it at a temple.

563
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:53,163
The body should be lightly dressed.
Use beanstalks for a good fire.

564
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:56,240
Beautiful day,
in spite of it all.

565
01:20:01,412 --> 01:20:05,872
It hasn't changed a bit.
It's good to be home!

566
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:12,681
Look!
The old phonograph.

567
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,390
I've missed this view.

568
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:07,370
Come back soon!

569
01:24:45,129 --> 01:24:48,792
The next morning,
I put some of Setsuko's ashes into...

570
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:52,130
the candy tin,
and then climbed down the hill.

571
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:55,205
I never went back to the shelter.

572
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:03,547
Seita...

573
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:22,633
Time for bed. Okay?

574
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:51,278
