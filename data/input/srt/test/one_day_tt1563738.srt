1
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,314
Bye, guys.

2
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,674
It's three years.

3
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,153
Three years together.

4
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,389
The lads.

5
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,669
Me and you?

6
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,115
We'll see each other again.
Really?

7
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,349
They're not going,
are they?

8
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,875
Group hug!

9
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,679
See you, ladies!
See you later.

10
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,438
Group hug.

11
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,476
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,594
Tilly?

13
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,955
Callum!

14
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,871
Tilly, come on.
It's time to go home.

15
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,916
Come on.
Callum!

16
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,312
Ow!

17
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,275
You know,
we've never actually met.

18
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,554
Actually, we have.
Several times.

19
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,629
Have we?

20
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,553
You gatecrashed my birthday party,
called me Julie,

21
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,039
and spilled red wine
down my top.

22
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,189
Ouch.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,319
Well, I'm sorry
about that.

24
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,435
No, not at all.

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,509
You were delightful.

26
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,555
Was I?

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,312
No. No, you weren't.

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,516
Look, if you're
not Julie, then...

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,794
I'm Emma.
Emma.

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,996
Emma Morley.
Emma Morley.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,477
Listen, I'll walk you home.

32
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,829
So this is me.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,239
Shh!
Welcome home.

34
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,993
So debate is fine,
but anyone can talk...

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,828
Just sometimes,
action's what's needed.

36
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,230
To change the world.
I completely agree.

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,749
So what are you gonna be when you're,
I don't know, 40?

38
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,829
Forty?

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,952
Can I say famous?
Horribly rich?

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,634
Terrible.
You're so terribly posh.

41
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,435
Where are you going?

42
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,475
I'm just gonna
go brush my teeth.

43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,993
You know,
booze and fags and...

44
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,069
I don't mind.

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,195
I do.

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,910
Listen, won't be a minute.

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,832
No playing with yourself
while I'm gone.

48
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,714
What?

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,315
All right, concentrate.

50
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,075
Concentrate.
Do not cock this up!

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,674
Oh, you're going?

52
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,672
Well, it's getting light out,
so I thought I could just...

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,716
You should go
if you want to go.

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,869
It's very poignant.
Very bittersweet.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,996
Really I just thought you
might wanna get some sleep.

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,115
I don't have to go.

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,315
No, no, go.
I'm not bothered.

58
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,839
Sneak off.

59
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,069
I wasn't sneaking off.

60
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,434
Jump out the window
for all I care.

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,953
It's five floors up, mind.

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,076
Look, I'll stay.
All right?

63
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,791
I'll stay.

64
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,279
Come on.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,109
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,430
It's just whenever
I go to bed with someone,

67
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,830
I always end up
either laughing or weeping,

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,831
and it could be nice to go
for something in between.

69
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,354
Look, that's fine.

70
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,512
That's fine. Maybe we
could just be friends.

71
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,313
Okay. Friends.

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,038
Of course, you know it's Saint Swithin's
Day today, don't you?

73
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,718
What is?

74
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,759
Well, today. Saint Swithin's Day,
the 15th of July.

75
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,637
How do you know that?

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,473
Well, he was buried in
Winchester Cathedral,

77
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,755
which is where
I went to school.

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,279
Well, la-dee-da.

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,833
La-dee-da.

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,153
You know, there's a poem.

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,949
"If on Saint Swithin's Day,
it doth rain

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,352
"something, something,
something remain."

83
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,232
Dexter, that's beautiful.

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,072
Shut up.

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,549
Let's get some sleep.

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,199
But, Dex.

87
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,673
Em?

88
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,512
If it doesn't rain...

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,953
Mmm-hmm?

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,918
...do you want to do something?
Me and you?

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,154
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,675
Are you all right?
Lift, lift.

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,870
Okay, well,
I'm coming up.

94
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,635
Couldn't you have just hired
someone to move this stuff?

95
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,755
No.

96
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,959
Look, I would have paid.

97
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,235
All right, lift from your end.

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,912
You've obviously never done
a day's work in your life.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,595
Look, seriously, Em,
my plane leaves in four hours.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,114
All right, well, all the more
reason why you should lift.

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,719
God's sake.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,989
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,036
And I am so, so grateful.

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,798
Stop whinging.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,631
I bet this bed could
tell some stories.

106
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,951
Yeah, short stories.
Horror stories.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,873
Welcome to London.
Well, lift it.

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,310
I think I'm gonna
be very happy here.

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,753
What is that smell?

110
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,239
Onions.

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,912
Onions and disappointment.

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,628
Right.

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,988
No, it's not that bad.

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,275
It's nothing that a
lick of paint

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,635
and a nuclear warhead can't fix.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,156
I've got my typewriter.
I've got my books. I'm in London.

117
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,508
I think it's going to be all right.

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,828
I might actually
get things done.

119
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,797
You know, you might
actually meet someone.

120
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,869
Dexter, please.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,989
A nice guy.

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,599
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

123
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,199
I told you I'm not interested
in any of that.

124
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,350
Matching glasses,
matching opinions.

125
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,873
I'm actually glad
you're going to India.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,310
Good, 'cause I'm leaving.
I've got to catch my flight.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,992
Already?

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,712
Yeah, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,713
Well, go on then.
Find yourself.

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,950
Keep sending me those letters.

131
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,871
Long ones.
I will.

132
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,474
And have fun, Em.

133
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,834
Of course.

134
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,478
You know, it is allowed.

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,151
You know, I've got a feeling
that this time next year

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,798
you're going to take
London by storm.

137
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,919
What is the difference between...

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,319
A tortilla is either corn or wheat.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,311
But a corn tortilla folded
and filled is a taco,

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,391
whereas a filled wheat
tortilla is a burrito.

141
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,072
Deep fry a burrito,
it's a chimichanga.

142
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,914
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,956
Is there any chance
you could repeat that?

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,914
Hello. I'm Ian.
Ian Whitehead.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,911
The new boy.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,797
Welcome to the graveyard
of ambition.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,597
The kitchen.
All right, mate.

148
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,796
What these guys can't
do with a microwave,

149
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,995
and a deep-fat fryer.

150
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,149
Hey, you!

151
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,995
Your basic Tex-Mex food groups.

152
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,752
Cheese on top of chicken
under guacamole

153
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,274
on top of beans
under rice on top of beef.

154
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,915
Word of warning,
avoid the jumbo prawns.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,798
It's like Russian Roulette.
One in six will kill you.

156
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,995
So what's your stroke?

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,753
Sorry, my what?

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,196
Waiter/actor,
waiter/model, waiter/writer?

159
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,872
Well, I'm a comedian.

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,075
We could use a comedian. We all
like to laugh. I know I used to.

161
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,593
Well, I'm just
starting out really.

162
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,075
Working on my
"unique comedy stylings."

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,039
Not jokes so much, more sort of wry,
little observations.

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,993
Ay caramba!

165
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,593
I've got this whole bit
at the moment

166
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,830
about the difference
between men and women.

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,992
How blokes, when they see a
girl they fancy, they get all...

168
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,514
Toilets. Staff toilets.
Oh.

169
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,874
Sorry. You were saying?

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,157
No, no. I'm doing an open mic tonight
if you were interested.

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,869
At The House of Laffs,
spelled L-A-F-F-S.

172
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,109
It's not a date or anything.

173
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,191
You've probably got a
boyfriend anyway, have you?

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,032
Ian, I'd love to come,
but after work,

175
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,714
I like to head home,
comfort eat, weep.

176
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,317
So what about you, Emma?
What's your stroke?

177
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,311
What do you really do?

178
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,392
Uh, this. This is what I do.

179
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,594
Still, it's not forever, is it?

180
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,828
My room still smells. Tilly's sending
me mad. The flat's a dump.

181
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,876
I keep finding teeth
marks in the cheese

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,191
and her big gray bras
soaking in the sink.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,077
Look, I'm sure it's
not a complete disaster.

184
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,599
London's swallowed me up.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,159
I thought I'd make a difference,
but no one knows I'm here.

186
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,595
Listen, listen. Nothing truly
good was ever easy.

187
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,669
who said that?

188
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,349
You did.

189
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,919
Did I? That's annoying.

190
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,713
I'm sorry for moaning. I just...
I really wanted to hear...

191
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,518
How's teaching?
How's Paris?

192
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,434
It's good, Em.

193
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,909
You know, truly, really fulfilling.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,036
well, don't sleep with
any of your students.

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,196
It's unethical and predictable.

196
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,918
It's good advice, Em.
Thank you.

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,392
But I've got to go
and have lunch with Mum.

198
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,756
well, apologize again, will you?

199
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,115
I didn't mean to
call your dad a fascist.

200
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,719
A bourgeois fascist.

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,712
Say sorry and, Dexter...

202
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,994
My money's running out.
Em?

203
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,236
Can you hear me?
Dex? Dex?

204
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,992
I miss you.

205
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,468
Forty-five minutes late.

206
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,828
Yeah, well, I got waylaid.

207
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,512
And where were
you last night?

208
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,914
Language school disco.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,434
Was it fun?
No, it was hell.

210
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,432
Tell me, who's been writing you
all those long letters?

211
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,272
That is none of your business.

212
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,113
Was it that girl
who came to stay?

213
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,679
Yeah. Well, Emma and I
are just good friends.

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,793
How much holiday
do you need?

215
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,633
I'm not on holiday.
I'm teaching English.

216
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,709
Dexter.

217
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,277
Isn't that Alain Delon?

218
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,669
What?
Oh, no. It's your father.

219
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,589
Picking his corns.
Stop it.

220
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,071
Take me for lunch
tomorrow, will you?

221
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,749
Just you and me. Somewhere quiet
with white tablecloths.

222
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,876
I want to talk to you.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,069
Why? Is something wrong?

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,469
No. Nothing's wrong.

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,788
Then why do we need to talk?

226
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,592
Do I need a reason?

227
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,475
There you are.
Degenerate.

228
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,757
Now, I thought
you might want these.

229
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,114
Oh, thank you, my love.

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,590
So what's for supper?
Please, God, not French food.

231
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,829
Golden Boy wants to see you.
Hmm?

232
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,951
He's got a new one.

233
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,632
Good night.
Good night.

234
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,954
Night.
Good night.

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,035
Have a good one.

236
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,109
We were just kissing.

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,749
You were trying to fit her
entire head in your mouth.

238
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,877
People have enough trouble
keeping the food down as it is.

239
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,837
And what does she
see in you, anyway?

240
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,036
Well, she says
I'm complicated.

241
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,919
You're just spoiled.

242
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,159
I got offered the job
of manager today.

243
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,708
They told me they wanted someone
who wasn't going anywhere.

244
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,837
All right, Em, listen. I think you
should take a bottle of tequila,

245
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,399
I think you should
walk out the door,

246
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,033
and I don't think you
need to ever come back.

247
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,633
But my job is my life.

248
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,792
You can't throw away years
of your life just because,

249
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,836
well, you think it's funny.

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,151
My hair smells of cheese.
Monterey Jack.

251
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,156
Look, I thought you
were writing poetry.

252
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,312
What, go where the money is?
Tried that. Failed.

253
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,238
You just can't
see it, can you?

254
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,153
Look, you're funny. You're attractive.
You're smart.

255
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,231
I mean, you're
the smartest person I know.

256
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,635
Sure.
You are. You're attractive.

257
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,312
You're sexy.
What?

258
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,436
What? Is that supposed to be
sexist or something?

259
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,229
No, it's not sexist.
It's just ridiculous.

260
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,833
Em, listen.

261
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,476
If I could just give
you one gift, all right,

262
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,591
one gift for the
rest of your life,

263
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,478
do you know what I'd give you?

264
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,879
Confidence.

265
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,035
It's either that
or a scented candle.

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,519
Come here.

267
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,838
Emma? So I've disinfected
the meat fridge.

268
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,638
My hero.

269
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
Thank you, Ian.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,793
Bye, mate.

271
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,909
Bye, Emma.

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,797
I should go, too.
All right.

273
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,395
I'll be fine. I just
feel a bit lost, that's all.

274
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,755
Come on, everyone's lost at 25.

275
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,353
You're not.

276
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,479
Trainee TV producer.
Nice new flat. CD player.

277
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,391
Group sex
Tuesdays and Fridays.

278
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,631
Yeah, but you know,
I am crying on the inside.

279
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,114
You know what you need,
don't you?

280
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,519
Mmm-mmm.

281
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,751
You need a holiday.

282
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,673
Look, Dexter, all I'm saying is
I think we need some rules.

283
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,318
Rules!

284
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,795
I'm not taking any chances
with our friendship,all right.

285
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,672
All right, all right.
Such as?

286
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,909
Separate bedrooms.

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,594
Wherever we stay, no shared beds,
no drunken cuddles.

288
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,716
I don't see the point
of cuddling, anyway.

289
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,915
Cuddling gives you cramp.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,035
Agreed, then.

291
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,879
Rule number two.
No flirting.

292
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,235
No having a few drinks
and getting frisky with me.

293
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,309
Or anyone else.

294
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,355
Well, I never flirt.

295
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,953
I'm serious.

296
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,513
Hello, what's this?

297
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,996
Which leads me to rule three.

298
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,150
The nudity clause.
What?

299
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,435
I don't want to see you
in the shower, or have a wee.

300
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,999
Or have a wee in the shower.

301
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,314
Well, I can't promise that.

302
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,919
You have to, Dex.
It's the rules,

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,675
and absolutely
no skinny-dipping.

304
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,710
All right, then. Rule number four.
What?

305
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,552
No Scrabble.
I love Scrabble.

306
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,473
That is exactly
why it's my rule.

307
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,788
Look, we're not dead yet.

308
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,079
Voilà.

309
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,754
What is that?

310
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,196
Hmm? My swimming costume.
It's called the Edwardian.

311
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,794
No, the masonry paint.

312
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,474
It's factor 30. I burn.

313
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,516
Here, let me.

314
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,112
I've not seen this before.

315
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,714
What, that?
I got that in Thailand.

316
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,637
It's a yin-yang.

317
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,876
Looks like a road sign.

318
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,633
Yeah, well, it means
"the perfect union of opposites."

319
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,950
It means "wear some socks."

320
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,117
This is scooped a
bit low, isn't it?

321
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,033
Good job I didn't
put it on backwards.

322
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,435
I think I'll go for a dip.

323
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,391
This is a nudist beach.

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,515
No, it's not.

325
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,910
It is. Look.
They're barbecuing!

326
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,833
You see, I couldn't do that.
Barbecue naked.

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,639
What is that?
Is that yoga?

328
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,398
Oh, God.

329
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,950
Grow up, all right.
Back to your magazine.

330
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,239
I can hear you thinking. It's
like this crunching noise.

331
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,799
The answer is no.

332
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,919
Don't you think we'd feel more
comfortable with our clothes off?

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,718
Unbelievable.
Just unbelievable.

334
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,949
Well, why not?

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,271
The rules. Not to
mention your girlfriend.

336
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,759
What, Ingrid?
Yeah, Ingrid.

337
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,831
She's very uninhibited.

338
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,717
She'd have had her top off
at the check-in desk.

339
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,075
Well, as you keep pointing out,
Ingrid used to be a model.

340
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,515
You could be a model.

341
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,830
For a catalog or something.

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,868
I'm just saying that we're not
entirely unknown to each other

343
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,234
from a physical point of view.

344
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,435
Drop it, Dex.

345
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,353
Well, you know,
that night after graduation.

346
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,839
Come on, you must remember.

347
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,678
No. Blanked it out
like a car crash.

348
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,069
Well, I haven't.

349
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,390
In fact, if I close my eyes,

350
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,119
I can still see you there just
standing in the dawn light.

351
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,235
Please don't.

352
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,118
Provocatively unclasping
your dungarees

353
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,315
as you walk over to me.

354
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,992
I was not wearing
dungarees.

355
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,992
So you do remember, huh?

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,397
Have I caught the sun?

357
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,838
No, you look...

358
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,592
You look fine.

359
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,873
Do you know I've
never been abroad?

360
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,439
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

361
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,953
It's true.

362
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,998
Fortnight in a caravan in Whitby
drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad

363
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,435
and trying not to kill Mum.

364
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,152
I can't believe I'm
actually here with you.

365
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,437
Why?
Hmm?

366
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,839
Why?

367
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,559
When we were at university,
before we spoke even,

368
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,069
I had a crush on you.

369
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,832
Ridiculous, I know.

370
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,710
But when we almost

371
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,597
did it that night,

372
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,557
I couldn't believe it.

373
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,875
I wrote poems and everything.

374
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,351
What have you
got to say to that?

375
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,635
Well, I already knew.

376
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,676
What do you mean, you knew?

377
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,796
Well, I sort of guessed.

378
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,431
All those epic letters
and compilation tapes.

379
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,192
So, go on then.
What happened?

380
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,508
Mmm.

381
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,319
I got to know you.
You cured me of you.

382
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,714
I'd still like to read those poems.
What rhymes with Dexter?

383
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,268
Prick. It's a half-rhyme.

384
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Too much wine. We should go.

385
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,992
No, no, no.
Not yet. Not yet.

386
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,389
Listen, let's go for a walk.

387
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,594
So this is it.

388
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,272
It's lovely.

389
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,112
Hello? What's going on here?

390
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,509
Well, I thought we'd go for
a quick swim. Sober us up.

391
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,433
Ah, I get it. I get it.

392
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,397
I've walked right
into it, haven't I?

393
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,996
You get a girl drunk and lead
her to a large body of water.

394
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,355
Oh, come on, Em.
Be spontaneous.

395
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,079
Be reckless.
Live for the moment!

396
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,072
Come on, Em. Get in!

397
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,434
No!

398
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,433
You're such a prude.
Why are you such a prude?

399
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,158
Look, come on!

400
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,275
You could at least
leave your underpants on.

401
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,839
Rule number three, remember?

402
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,399
Come on.

403
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,277
So this is skinny-dipping?

404
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,871
What am I meant to do? Sort of
lark about? Splash you or something?

405
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,870
That's a very serious face.

406
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,035
You're not having a wee, are you?

407
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,473
No.

408
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,837
No, I just wanted to say that

409
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,114
I felt the same.

410
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,471
After our near-miss.

411
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,479
I mean, I didn't write poems
or anything. I'm not insane.

412
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,395
But, you know,
I thought about you.

413
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,751
I think about you.

414
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,993
You and me.

415
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,593
Really?

416
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,596
Really? Okay, well...

417
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,913
Dex...

418
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,749
The problem is I fancy
pretty much everyone.

419
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,629
Oh. I see.
I mean anyone.

420
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,433
Really, I mean, it's like I've just
got out of prison, all the time.

421
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,397
It's a real problem.
I can imagine.

422
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,948
Yeah, and this thing with Ingrid,
it's a sex thing.

423
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,235
It's just sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

424
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,629
The point's been made, Dex.

425
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,269
But me and you,
it would be different.

426
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,031
I think we'd want
different things,

427
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,588
and I don't think
I'm ready, you know.

428
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,309
If you wanted to,
you know, have a bit of fun,

429
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,828
holiday fling,
no obligations.

430
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,032
Oh, God. I'll take that
as a no then, shall I?

431
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,394
I think so. I think
our moment's passed.

432
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,119
Come on, I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

433
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,031
No, no, you are, Dex.
That's the problem.

434
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,519
You're worried I might care.

435
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,673
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

436
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,115
Come back, you little... Hey!

437
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,556
Thieves!
Come back. Come back here.

438
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,119
Wait!

439
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,993
They've stolen my clothes!
You little...

440
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,392
Will someone call the police?
Wait! Come back!

441
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,389
Could you please stop laughing
and do something to help?

442
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,396
Armani, that suit was.

443
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,155
The little frogs even
took my underpants.

444
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,229
Armani?

445
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,469
No, Calvin Klein.

446
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,073
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

447
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,713
Little French bastards!

448
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,631
They took your
plimsolls, too.

449
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,473
They're not plimsolls. I've
never worn plimsolls in my life.

450
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,471
They were penny loafers,
and I bloody loved them!

451
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,191
What? It's not funny.
I'm a victim of crime here.

452
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,234
Dex?

453
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,549
What?

454
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,158
Your Calvin Klein underpants.

455
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,992
I'll find them.

456
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,674
I swear to you,
I shall track them down.

457
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,990
Go to sleep.

458
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,989
I wonder how many
rules we broke.

459
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,911
All of them.

460
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,313
Except Scrabble.

461
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,992
Tomorrow, maybe.

462
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,557
Who says quality TV is dead?

463
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,358
Plenty more of this when we
come back  after the break,

464
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,475
so do not go away.

465
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,154
I'm warning you.
We know where you live.

466
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,798
Go on, get out of here.

467
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,958
Look, I just called,
all right, to let you know

468
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,833
that you are the best
friend I've ever had.

469
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,474
I'm touched, Dex, but you're
off your face. And?

470
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,437
Look, it's 5:00 in
the morning. Go home.

471
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,717
And you have
an incredible body.

472
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,279
Dex!

473
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,509
Is that Dexter?

474
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,399
Just promise me
you'll go home, please?

475
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,232
I will, I will, I will,
I will, I will, I will.

476
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,833
Dex, you have work
in the morning. Dex...

477
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,393
Look, good night, all right?

478
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,076
Remember, you are absolutely,
truly amazing.

479
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
Dexter? Dex?

480
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,912
You're amazing

481
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,912
and famous.

482
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,638
I'm not that famous.

483
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,956
Aye, aye.
How are you, old man?

484
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,235
Your mother's upstairs. She's
been waiting all morning for you.

485
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,190
Good God, why are
you sweating like that?

486
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,351
Well, it's a hot day.

487
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,635
No, it's not.

488
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,676
Look, how is she?

489
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,354
Well, why don't you go and see?

490
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,348
Mum?

491
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,038
Hello, hello.

492
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,552
Hello, stranger.

493
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,632
Look, I've got a present for you here.

494
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,188
It's not from me.
It's from Emma.

495
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,954
Here, let me.

496
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,274
Thank you.

497
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,199
Oh, how lovely.

498
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,874
A little ambitious maybe.

499
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,316
You might want to push her
towards short stories in the future.

500
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,277
Mum, don't.

501
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,469
So what have you been up to?

502
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,353
I'm Dexter Mayhew. what a show
we've got for you tonight.

503
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,431
we've got a man who claims...

504
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,993
I'll skip this next bit.

505
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,432
There's an interview
that's pretty good.

506
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,870
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

507
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,195
The live show is
always a bit patchy.

508
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,475
I don't understand why you
have to use that voice,

509
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,711
but then I suppose I just don't
care for this sort of thing.

510
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,916
It's just a bit
of fun for kids.

511
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,235
They just watch it
after the pub.

512
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,719
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

513
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,313
No, it's not that.

514
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,233
You know, honestly, Dexter.
Dancing girls in cages.

515
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,276
Is this what it's come to?

516
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,713
I just host it.

517
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,472
It's a means to an end, that's all.

518
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,834
But to what end?

519
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,115
We always said you could
do anything you wanted.

520
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,839
Fine. What do you
want me to do?

521
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,751
Something good.
It is good.

522
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,072
I just do what I'm told.
Look, this is what I can do.

523
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,317
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,994
The medication makes me ratty.

525
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,437
I just need a little lie-down.
I'll be better tonight.

526
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,909
Yeah, you know, um...

527
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,834
Actually, I've got
this premiere thingy tonight.

528
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,152
Look, I'm sorry. I can't miss it.
It's Jurassic Park.

529
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,632
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some help.

530
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,633
Are you all right?
Here, put your arm around me.

531
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,597
All right.
All right?

532
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,875
Are you all right?

533
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,949
Yes.

534
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,273
Can I get you anything?
Water? Dry martini?

535
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,239
What time is it?

536
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,873
Quarter past 6:00.

537
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,037
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

538
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,951
I'm afraid you've missed our day.

539
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,998
Your father's a little
angry with you.

540
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,594
Look, I'll stay tonight.

541
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,188
No. You go.

542
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,871
No pleasure for me watching you
and your father snarling at each other.

543
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,996
Can I speak frankly?

544
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,314
Do you have to?

545
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,118
I think it's my prerogative.

546
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,155
I know that you're going to be a
fine man. Decent, loving, accomplished.

547
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,515
But I don't think
you're there yet.

548
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,513
And right now, well, I worry

549
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,754
that you're not
very nice anymore.

550
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,838
Well, there's
nothing I can say to that.

551
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,070
There is nothing you have to.

552
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,559
I'm not going to
argue with you.

553
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,393
You can come and collect your
car when you're sober.

554
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,359
You're being ridiculous. I mean,
you cannot confiscate my car key.

555
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,159
Do not dare to
insult my intelligence!

556
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,634
Now your mother loves you very much.
You know that.

557
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,672
But for whatever time
she has left to her...

558
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,917
If you ever, ever come to see
your mother in this state again,

559
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,195
I will not let you
in the house.

560
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,629
I will close the door
in your face. Now...

561
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,829
Go.

562
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,754
Fine.

563
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,871
You're not there. I just remembered
you're on a hot date tonight.

564
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,877
I'm too late.

565
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,918
Okay, can you call me
when you get this?

566
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,434
It's just I need
to speak to someone.

567
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,159
Not someone. You.

568
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,914
A chainsaw for an arm.
It was mad.

569
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,353
It's a work of
timeless beauty.

570
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,749
It's the finest of
the trilogy, methinks.

571
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,673
And I still understood it without seeing
Evil Dead I or Evil Dead II.

572
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,116
My only complaint would be that
there wasn't enough violence.

573
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,079
You didn't mind, did you? Or did you
want to see Three Colors: Blue?

574
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,709
I'm gonna skip a starter
because I had those nachos,

575
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,799
but you go ahead. You can
have anything you like.

576
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,833
Anything up to
the value of, say, £ 14.00?

577
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,314
No, no, seriously,
no, have anything.

578
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,516
Well, you know,
within reason.

579
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,594
It's just so good
to see you again.

580
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
And you're going to be
an amazing teacher.

581
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,632
Congratulations.
Thanks.

582
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,836
I wish I'd had more
teachers like you.

583
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,629
Not that I'd have got any
work done. Miss Morley.

584
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,591
You have no new messages.

585
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,555
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

586
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,677
Sometimes, Emma,
I think the only way

587
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,829
I'm going to see
my name up in lights

588
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,639
is if I change it
to Emergency Exit.

589
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,669
Anyway, I'm doing an improvisation
night at the moment.

590
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,398
Mr. Giggles.
Not his real name.

591
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,040
But I think I'm gonna stick to
the more observational material.

592
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,439
I've got this whole
thing at the moment

593
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,839
about the difference
between cats and dogs.

594
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,512
Hey, please stop.

595
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,828
Okay. Do you know
what the hardest thing

596
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,279
about being a stand-up comedian is?

597
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,759
Is it the clothes?

598
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,279
Very good. No.

599
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,031
It's that people expect you
to be on all the time.

600
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,509
Because if you're not being funny,
then what are you being?

601
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,953
Ian, it's not a performance.

602
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,918
Except it sort of is,
though, isn't it?

603
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,029
I've been so excited about
seeing you. Like nervous.

604
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,715
I'm sorry, I...

605
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,028
I'm no good at
this stuff, either.

606
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,873
It's just I graduated today.

607
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,078
I'm finally, actually qualified
to do something useful,

608
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,953
and I wanted to
celebrate with someone.

609
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,354
Was Dexter busy?

610
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,674
Em, when you hear this, can you
just get in a cab? And I'll pay.

611
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,113
Maybe you could even stay over,
you know, on the sofa or something?

612
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,589
I need to just see you.

613
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,558
Please, can you just come over?

614
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,116
Emma Morley?
Hmm?

615
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,519
Can I say something?

616
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,353
Go on.

617
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,992
I think you are
the absolute bollocks.

618
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,310
You, with your honeyed words.

619
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,353
I should probably
head home.

620
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,637
Don't go.
Let's go somewhere else.

621
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,235
I live near, actually. I mean,
it's a dump, like, horrible.

622
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,438
But I've got music and booze.

623
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,953
Or a hot, milky drink
if you prefer.

624
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,678
We could go on
an Ovaltine bender.

625
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,274
All right. Okay.
One, two, three, go!

626
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,675
Which way?

627
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,273
This way, this way,
this way!

628
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,273
That's not needy.
That's just affection.

629
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,352
I've just got
a lot of love to give.

630
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,228
Well, if I can't call you,
can I come and see you?

631
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,158
Do you know where
the matches are?

632
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,355
No.

633
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,557
You might wanna leave it
for a couple of minutes. Go.

634
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,353
Hi, Miss Morley.
Hi.

635
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,351
There gonna be
a showbiz party afterwards

636
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,352
with champagne, and canapés,
and the tinkle of laughter?

637
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,238
It's a school play, Ian. I suspect
we'll be home by half 9:00.

638
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,278
Why don't you stay at mine for a change?
I'll wash my duvet cover.

639
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,153
Is that your boyfriend,
Miss Morley?

640
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,958
Oy! Cheeky.

641
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,918
Greetings, boys and girls.
Welcome to the Late Night Lock In.

642
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,991
Camera one, Dexter.

643
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,957
The show that is late,
live and loud.

644
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,031
Dexter, gentleman to see you.

645
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,075
Mind the cables, sir.

646
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,037
Hey. Okay, ladies.

647
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,953
I helped myself
to tea and buns.

648
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,838
I hope I'm not going
to get you into trouble.

649
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,154
I'm sure it'll be fine.

650
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,395
There he is! Hey!

651
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,870
Doesn't he look gorgeous?
Come to Suki.

652
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,554
Suki Sue. Come here.

653
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,879
I just want to
eat you up.

654
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,998
Suki, actually,
look, this is my father.

655
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,798
Wotcha, Mr. M.

656
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,075
Isn't your son gorgeous?

657
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,559
Um, he's very nice.

658
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,517
And where's Mrs. M?

659
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,669
Sadly, she passed away.

660
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,797
Barry, I need some water.

661
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,393
What an appalling woman.

662
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,948
Actually, she's sort
of my girlfriend.

663
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,349
Oh, well, congratulations.

664
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,349
Your mother would have
been most impressed.

665
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,109
Thanks, Dad.

666
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,350
I'll be watching at home
if I can stay awake.

667
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,958
Have fun

668
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,474
and don't take any notice of
what they say in the papers.

669
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,790
Okay, sir. If you'd
like to come this way.

670
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,995
Please.

671
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,590
I'm the king of
car crash television.

672
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,033
But you're the king of it.
That's good.

673
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,236
Caption under photo. "Odious."

674
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,593
why can't you come again?

675
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,039
Because I'm working.

676
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,031
I'll send a car to
come and pick you up.

677
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,111
Dex, I can't.

678
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,994
I know, and I'm sorry. I'm just so
much better when you're around.

679
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,599
Look, I'm just worried
I'm gonna be

680
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,233
stood in front of
the camera thinking,

681
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,799
"What's the bloody point?"

682
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,189
The show's ridiculous.
I'm such a fraud, Em.

683
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,396
Hey, come on. That's enough.

684
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,074
You know what you're doing.
You'll be fine.

685
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,149
Right.

686
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,993
Just don't speak
in that weird voice, okay?

687
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,116
Okay.
All right. Bye.

688
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,988
Get ready. Here we go.

689
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,832
Great stuff.
Let's move. Let's move!

690
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,273
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

691
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,990
We're on, superstar.

692
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Late Night Lock In.

693
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,591
The show that is late, live...

694
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,671
And loud!

695
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,910
And what a show
we've got for you tonight.

696
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,919
Yay!

697
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,157
Well done, darling.

698
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,269
Thank you.

699
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,396
Come on, Miss Morley.

700
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,833
Bravo!

701
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,237
The Maxi Crew, ladies and gentlemen.
The Maxi Crew.

702
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,598
All right, take a seat, fellas.
Take a seat. You can sit down there.

703
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,470
Right, guys, I just wanna start by
saying that that jam was fresh.

704
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,189
Right, okay, so let's kick it off with...
Let's ask some questions.

705
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,829
what is hip hop? Is this the
voice from the street?

706
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,992
Is this why you guys
are just so angry?

707
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,274
No, dawg.

708
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,998
It's chill,
it's chill, it's chill.

709
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,509
Right, okay. Listen,
can you rap about anything?

710
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,068
For example, could you rap
about a cheese sandwich?

711
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,118
Are you new here?
Have you done this before?

712
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,150
Oh, dear.
Do not try this at home.

713
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,509
Ian?

714
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,273
Do you think you'll
finish painting today?

715
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,874
I'd like to at least
get the TV back inside.

716
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,833
All right, all right.
I can have breakfast first, can't I?

717
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,075
We've had breakfast.

718
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,549
All right, brunch, then.

719
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,870
Brunch. Is it lunch?
Is it breakfast?

720
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,195
No, it's brunch.
What about brinner, say?

721
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,872
Or brupper?

722
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,473
Well, I should get on.

723
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,158
Bearhug, snootch?

724
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,071
I thought we agreed
about snootch?

725
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,709
I can't seem to say anything
right these days, can I?

726
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,472
Look, if you don't
want me to go tonight...

727
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,318
No, you should go.

728
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,953
Or if you wanted
to come with us...

729
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,634
What? Dexter ignoring me, and you
talking over me? No, thank you.

730
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,755
It won't be like that.

731
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,949
Anyway, I've got a gig tonight

732
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,996
at The Rose & Crown,
Sir Laffalots.

733
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,151
Paid gig?

734
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,389
No.

735
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,709
Better get back to it then.

736
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,155
Thirty-four identical essays
on Lord of the Flies.

737
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,917
Em? About 1 700 hours, do you
fancy a little bit of the old...

738
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,235
You know, afternoon delight?

739
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,349
Wow!

740
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,598
You look incredible.

741
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,352
Oh... Ooh!

742
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,317
Let's see the dress.

743
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,035
Is it vintage?

744
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,195
No, it's brand new.

745
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,679
Really?
Mmm.

746
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,069
Well, you look great,
and I love the shoes.

747
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,550
Thank you. It's the world's
first orthopedic high heel.

748
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,234
Look, it's been too long, Em.

749
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,630
I need to have some fun tonight.
Can we have fun, please?

750
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,954
God, sorry.

751
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,949
Look, I'll be two seconds.
It's work.

752
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,155
I'm naked!

753
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,434
Suki, you nutter.

754
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,749
where are you, baby?

755
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,558
I thought you were supposed
to be at the party.

756
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,476
You do know they
damage your brain?

757
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,556
They do not damage
your brain.

758
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,119
How can you tell?

759
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,793
Ha ha, very funny, Em.

760
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,440
I guarantee you, one year, one year,
and you'll have one of these.

761
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,399
You're on. If I ever get a mobile phone,
you can buy me dinner.

762
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,471
What, again?

763
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,309
So, come on.
How's the king of comedy?

764
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,595
Oh, Ian's fine.
We both are.

765
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,318
Are you still
very much in love?

766
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,234
He can belch the theme to The A-Team.
I'm only flesh and blood.

767
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,551
I don't know. These days,
we don't seem to...

768
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,438
And how's the new place?
How's that?

769
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,308
Flat's fine. Well, it's a room
and a half in murder mile.

770
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,958
And Ian's been
talking about painting

771
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,917
the same wall
for the past six months.

772
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,675
But it's got potential. There's a view.
The Gasworks.

773
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,238
You should come round.

774
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,839
Mmm! Mmm.

775
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,638
How's Suki?

776
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,915
Oh, she's fantastic.
Yeah, gorgeous.

777
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,309
What's great for me is that she
really understands the industry.

778
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,789
You know, she knows exactly
what it's like to be...

779
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,239
I was gonna say "famous."
God, we hate the word.

780
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,878
Every time I turn on the telly,

781
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,439
she's there in
a pink rubber catsuit.

782
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,238
She's doing incredibly well.

783
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,112
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,031
Well, we both are.

785
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,156
I've got some really, really
exciting stuff coming up.

786
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,912
It's all sort of in development.

787
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,116
If I told you,
I'd have to shoot you.

788
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,599
Please do.

789
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,030
Never mind.
Start without me, all right?

790
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,549
Hello.

791
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,596
There you are. Enjoy.

792
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,750
What are you doing,
you silly thing?

793
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,956
Well, listen,
we'll talk later.

794
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,189
Look at this.
This looks gorgeous.

795
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,111
Are you all right?
Maybe she could join us?

796
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,273
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
I'm here to see you, remember?

797
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,238
Right, well,
how's the teaching?

798
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,794
What? If you're not
interested, don't ask.

799
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,438
I am interested.

800
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,875
I just thought you were going to
be writing this novel, that's all.

801
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,076
And I will.
But I have to earn a living.

802
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,589
More to the point, I enjoy it.
I'm a bloody good teacher, Dexter.

803
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,035
I'm sure you are.

804
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,439
Still, you know what they say?

805
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,033
No, what do they say?

806
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,350
You know, "Those who can..."

807
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,592
No, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar.
Finish the sentence.

808
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,231
All right.
Well, "Those who can, do,

809
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,118
"and those who can't, teach."

810
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,917
And those who can teach say,
"Go fuck yourself!"

811
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,677
Em! Em, come on. Look, whatever
I've done, I'm sorry.

812
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,273
You've obviously
had a bit too much to drink.

813
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,197
No, you're drunk!
You're drunk!

814
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,074
Do you realize that I have literally
not seen you sober for three years?

815
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,997
Nipping off to the toilet
every 10 minutes.

816
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,877
Either you're on coke,
or you've got dysentery.

817
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,838
Either way, it's boring! Banging on
about yourself all the time.

818
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,833
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex, but
you're a TV presenter, all right?

819
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,279
You've not invented penicillin.

820
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,271
All you do is stand around shouting,
"Make some noise!"

821
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,476
Look, I am having fun,
that's all.

822
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,756
I've been through
a lot recently.

823
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,989
I might get
a bit carried away,

824
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,309
but if you wouldn't
stop getting at me...

825
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,550
Am I?
I don't mean to, and I...

826
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,116
I know that you've been through a
lot with your mum and all, I know.

827
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,432
But, there are things that I
needed to talk to you about.

828
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,718
About how I am
stuck in this flat

829
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,358
with a man that I am
not in love with.

830
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,752
And if I can't talk to you, then
what is the point of you? Of us?

831
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,398
What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

832
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,112
I think we've outgrown each other.

833
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,476
No, you have outgrown me. You
think I'm uncool and dreary.

834
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,391
I don't think
you're dreary. Em...

835
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,110
I think if it's over, then we should
just face facts. Say goodbye.

836
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,679
It sounds like you're dumping me.

837
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,273
Yeah, maybe I am.

838
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,078
You're not who you used to be.

839
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,197
Come on, Em.
Look, I apologize!

840
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,879
Please.

841
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,076
Come on. That's it.

842
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,473
There.

843
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,239
I love you, Dexter. So much.

844
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,713
I just don't like you anymore.

845
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,310
I'm sorry.

846
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,916
Johnny Cage wins.

847
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,833
That's an almighty win
from the Blade Cruisers there.

848
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,434
I think you'll all agree.
Well done, guys.

849
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,876
That's all from tonight's Joy Stick Jockeys.
Join us next week

850
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,794
when we review the smoking
hot new console games coming at you.

851
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,111
Until then, night owls, keep gaming.

852
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,952
Do I really have to
say "smoking hot"?

853
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,513
It's just I'm 32,
for God's sake.

854
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,118
What, they're sacking me?

855
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,475
You see, sack has
negative connotations.

856
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,518
It's just they wanna
try a new presenter.

857
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,153
So they are sacking me?

858
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,276
Well, no, they're taking the
show in a different direction,

859
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,591
but it's a direction
away from you.

860
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,033
Okay, so less you now.

861
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,075
Okay.

862
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,957
More you in your 20s.

863
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,915
Right. Right.

864
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,956
So, what's the good news?

865
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,110
Sorry?

866
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,478
Well, you said you had some bad news.
What's the good news?

867
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,594
Every career has
its ups and downs.

868
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,109
This is just a bloody great down.

869
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,918
And I sense a bit of
disenchantment, Dexy.

870
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,230
Just a little concerned
about my future.

871
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,073
It's not quite
what I was expecting.

872
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,352
The future never is. That's what
makes it so bloody exciting!

873
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,116
Everyone loves you, yeah?

874
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,398
But they love you in that ironic,
love-to-hate kind of way.

875
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,072
Right?
And all that we need to do

876
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,515
is just find someone
that loves you for real.

877
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,678
Okay?
Yeah.

878
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,032
I love you, Sylvie.

879
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,316
No, no, wait.
No, I'm in love with you.

880
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,591
Look, I've never said
this to anyone before.

881
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,432
Well, that's a lie. Um...

882
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,230
I love you, Sylvie. I...

883
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,028
Sylvie tells me you used
to be quite well known.

884
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,792
TV presenter or something.

885
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,758
I did. Yeah.
Once upon a time.

886
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,515
Yes, on Larginit. That program.
Do you remember, Mummy?

887
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,828
You used to really hate it.

888
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,909
Yes.

889
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,592
"Turn it off," she used to say.

890
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,029
"Turn it off. It's
killing your brain cells."

891
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,792
That was you, was it?

892
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,552
You still work
in television, Dexter?

893
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,519
Not so much, no. That sort
of drifted away, really.

894
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,635
Uh-huh.

895
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,917
Dexter's just being modest.
He gets lots of offers.

896
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,831
Anyway, what he really
wants to do is produce.

897
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,759
Party games.

898
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,553
Are you there, Moriarty?

899
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,079
Here.

900
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,589
Two for two,
nice work, bro.

901
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,669
Going for a hat trick.

902
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,990
Are you there, Moriarty?

903
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,229
Here.

904
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,599
The crowd goes wild!

905
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,438
There's my boy!

906
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,839
Better luck next time, son.
Thank you.

907
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,434
Well, I'm still
very proud of you.

908
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,633
Oh, isn't this fun?

909
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,870
Dexter, care to take me on?
Oh, no.

910
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,995
That's a terrific idea.

911
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,069
Darling, are you sure?

912
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,798
Yes, I'm sure.

913
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,037
Come on, chap.
Pick up your weapon.

914
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,190
Nice and tight, Mum.

915
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,753
All right?
All right.

916
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,394
Very good. We don't
want you cheating.

917
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,391
Good luck.
All right.

918
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,357
Come on, sis.

919
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,238
All right, ready?

920
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,833
As ready as I'll...

921
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,708
Good God, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

922
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,637
That table was from Italy.
I'm so sorry.

923
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,950
I must have just caught her
at a funny angle there.

924
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,838
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty.

925
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,833
I know. I know. I'm so sorry. Look,
I don't know what I was thinking.

926
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,353
Wanker!

927
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,189
Serves me right
for not changing the locks.

928
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,429
Looking good, Ian.

929
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,754
You can get stuffed, Emma.

930
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,795
Is that from your act?

931
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,957
No, though I have got this new
thingI've been working on.

932
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,314
God.

933
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,437
I come on, and I say,
"Here's a funny story. You'll like this."

934
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,795
Ian.
"There's this guy,

935
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,270
"and he's going out with this girl,
and he worships her,

936
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,828
"and they buy
this flat together.

937
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,753
"And then he gets her
an engagement ring, the lot.

938
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,675
"It turns out that she is still
in love with her best friend."

939
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,911
Interesting theory, Ian, except
I've not seen Dexter for ages.

940
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,718
No?
That is not the reason.

941
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,749
Do you know how he found out about it?
He read it in her poetry.

942
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,159
You bastard!

943
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,151
Give it back to me!
"Our graduation night!

944
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,276
"The erotic intensity
of the shared bed."

945
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,318
"That magic week in France."
It's all here in blank verse.

946
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,994
If you ever, ever, come in
here again I will call the police!

947
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,672
Call the bloody police!
It's my flat, too!

948
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,950
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

949
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,510
You just sat around farting and
watching the bloody wrath of Khan!

950
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,794
You love The wrath of Khan.

951
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,599
I hate The wrath of Khan.

952
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,233
It's a good job
we didn't get married.

953
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,834
I'm sorry about going
through all your stuff.

954
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,514
I've just been a bit mad
recently, that's all.

955
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,352
It's all right.

956
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,191
I miss you.

957
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,554
I know you do.

958
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,631
Like, right here.

959
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,672
Either that, or it's trapped wind.
I'm not sure.

960
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,870
Either way, it'll pass.

961
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,916
It's good, by the way.

962
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,514
Not the poems.
The poems are awful,

963
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,553
but the rest of the stuff,
the stories. You're funny.

964
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,517
Proper funny.

965
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,828
Not like me.
Ian.

966
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,558
No, I'm just saying that you
should show them to someone,

967
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,518
because you're
better than you know.

968
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,194
Oh!

969
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,835
So that's Emma Morley.
We went to university together.

970
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,148
Did you sleep with her as well?

971
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,514
No.

972
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,749
What about the bride?

973
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,717
No.
God, what is this?

974
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,316
It's just that every weekend
we go to a wedding

975
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,994
with a coachload of people
that you've slept with.

976
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,399
It's like a conference.

977
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,748
Okay. Come on.

978
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,478
You know you're the
only one for me now.

979
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,279
You are. Come on,
come here. Come here.

980
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,988
Hummus wraps.
Organic smoothies.

981
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,832
Fair Trade coffees.

982
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:15,269
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy
for the little buggers.

983
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,669
I've got 12 branches already.
Twelve more by the end of the year.

984
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,273
Well, you know,
there's a rumor going around

985
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,998
that you're actually
a multi millionaire.

986
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,792
Come on.

987
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,312
Well, define multi.

988
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,959
You should come and have lunch.
We should talk.

989
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,439
What, are you
offering me a job?

990
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,993
No, I'm just saying...

991
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,514
You are, aren't you?
You're offering me a job.

992
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,034
Look, I haven't seen you
on telly for a while.

993
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,076
I thought if you
wanted a fresh start...

994
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,156
Callum, mate.
Mate, mate, mate.

995
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,277
At university, you wore
the same pair of jeans for...

996
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,316
What was it, four years?

997
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,277
Long time ago now, pal.

998
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,552
We're not students anymore.

999
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,868
Someone seems
to be enjoying it.

1000
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,109
Look, look over here.

1001
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,758
Have you seen Emma Morley?

1002
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,400
Right under our noses
all this time. Eh?

1003
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,593
Who knew?

1004
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,117
I sit and wait

1005
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,317
Does an angel

1006
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,756
Contemplate my fate

1007
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,508
Do they know

1008
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,717
I tell you, the one discovery
changed my life.

1009
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,830
Crayfish.

1010
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,957
I've got 12 branches already.
Another 12 by the end of the year.

1011
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,996
I was telling Dexter there's
plenty of opportunities.

1012
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,389
Darling, I'll be back in a bit.

1013
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,919
Do you want some champagne?

1014
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,389
It's not champagne.
It's Spanish.

1015
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,470
when I'm lying in my bed

1016
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,472
Thoughts running
through my head

1017
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,358
And I feel that love is dead

1018
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,956
I'm loving angels instead

1019
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,155
Do you want to
get out of here?

1020
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,389
Yes, please.

1021
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,156
And through it all
She offers me protection

1022
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,754
A lot of love and affection

1023
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,193
Today must be quite tough for you,
having slept with the bride.

1024
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,154
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1025
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,550
What? How do you
know all these things?

1026
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,471
Tilly told me all about it.
Oh, did she?

1027
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,518
The foot massage
spun out of control.

1028
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,194
I think you even
used my olive oil.

1029
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,953
Footprints halfway
up the kitchen wall.

1030
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,439
Well, that stuff's
behind me now, so...

1031
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,839
Really, what happened?

1032
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,599
Sex in toilet cubicles
lose its bittersweet charm?

1033
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,274
Well, an orgy won't keep you
warm at night, Emma.

1034
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,191
An orgy won't look after you
when you're old.

1035
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,599
Well said.

1036
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,077
Anyway, I screwed up my career.

1037
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,230
And screwed up things with Mum.

1038
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,795
That's not true.

1039
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,069
And I screwed up my friendships.

1040
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,589
And then Sylvie
just came along.

1041
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,638
And she sort of,
well, saved me, really.

1042
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,876
She's very beautiful.

1043
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,599
Of course, she has absolutely
no sense of humor.

1044
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,794
Just as well. A sense of
humor's overrated.

1045
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,036
Goofing around all the time.

1046
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,270
The only time Ian
ever really made me laugh

1047
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,873
was when he fell
down the stairs.

1048
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,918
Well, you know, Sylvie says
she doesn't like to laugh.

1049
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,276
Doesn't really like
what it does to her face.

1050
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,556
But you love her, right?

1051
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,437
Yeah, I worship her.

1052
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:56,195
I'm loving Colin instead

1053
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,029
Oh, no, no. This way.

1054
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,473
Where are we going?

1055
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,475
Dex?

1056
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,554
Oh!

1057
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,194
So, come on, then.
You, huh?

1058
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,077
Any romance?

1059
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,639
Don't start, Dex.

1060
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,709
What?

1061
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,713
Your sympathy.
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

1062
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,552
There, how'd that sound?

1063
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,596
Yeah, yeah.
I bought that.

1064
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,908
It's true.

1065
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,358
I've got a tiny advance
to write this book.

1066
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,194
Em!

1067
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,515
Mmm-hmm.

1068
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,795
Well, you know, I have
something to tell you, too.

1069
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,792
You're getting married.

1070
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,393
Yeah.

1071
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,795
So, you're pleased?

1072
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,111
Of course I'm pleased, Dex.
Fantastic news, really.

1073
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,631
Scented? Your wedding
invitations are scented.

1074
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,631
Yeah, lavender.

1075
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,792
No, Dex, it's money.
They smell of money.

1076
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,599
August 1 4th?

1077
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,309
Yeah, I think that's what
they call a shotgun wedding.

1078
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,556
For 350.

1079
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,753
With buffet.

1080
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,193
Do you know who the father is?

1081
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,679
Stop it.

1082
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,591
I'm kidding.

1083
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,715
Congratulations.

1084
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,789
Thank you.

1085
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,438
A dad.
I know.

1086
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,436
Is that allowed?
Will they let you?

1087
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,596
It's incredible, isn't it?

1088
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,831
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

1089
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,353
Do you really think so?

1090
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,158
I don't doubt it
for a minute.

1091
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,837
I missed you, Dex.

1092
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,836
Well, I missed you, too.

1093
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,311
No more disappearing.

1094
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,155
No, well, I won't
if you won't.

1095
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,913
Mmm?
Mmm.

1096
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,829
Dex?

1097
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,998
We should go.

1098
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,271
Absolutely, let's go.

1099
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,036
Come on, Jasmine.
Come on.

1100
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,994
Come on.
You gonna stop crying?

1101
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,268
How you getting on?

1102
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,316
Good, mate.
Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,628
Not quite what
I was expecting, but...

1104
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,749
How do you mean?

1105
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,798
Well, you see the words
organic and homemade...

1106
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,871
Yeah, I know. You imagined
a couple of hippies

1107
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,793
on a little farm somewhere,
knitting their own muesli.

1108
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,871
Nice idea, but this
is business, Dex.

1109
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,190
Yeah, well, I realize that.
Here's your last two.

1110
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,953
Listen, mate. You're only
here to learn the ropes, okay?

1111
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,553
Company policy.
Everyone has to.

1112
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,949
Callum, I'm enjoying it.

1113
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,473
Honestly, I'm good.

1114
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,912
There's plenty
of formula left.

1115
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,396
I've pureed the veggies,
or you could mash a banana.

1116
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,155
And what about Indian food?
I can give her a curry, can't I?

1117
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,390
No, no, no, Dexter. No.

1118
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,879
Sylvie, I'm joking.

1119
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,319
Oh, I see.

1120
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,231
I keep missing those, don't I?

1121
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,992
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm late.

1122
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,792
I don't even know why I'm going.

1123
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,757
I'm too old for hen nights.
No, you're not.

1124
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,909
That's my cab.

1125
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,149
Right, come on, then.

1126
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,559
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

1127
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,954
Okay.

1128
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,871
Be good. Try not to
burn the house down.

1129
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,995
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

1130
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,630
Goodbye, my sweetheart.
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1131
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,199
Say goodbye to Mummy.

1132
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,272
Oh, I know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1133
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,592
Have a good time.

1134
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,034
Oh! Come on.
We'll be all right, won't we?

1135
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,759
Party started
there's no end in sight

1136
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,434
Everybody's moving
to the rhythm that's inside

1137
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:13,671
It's a crazy world but
tonight's the right situation

1138
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,315
I am Spartacus.

1139
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,590
No, I'm Spartacus.

1140
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,033
No, I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus.

1141
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,395
wahey! Let's have a big hand
and give a round of applause...

1142
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,391
Look, Jas.
Look, that's Daddy's ex.

1143
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,550
...for basketball
stars TJ and Mickey D!

1144
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,073
Isn't she loud?

1145
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,879
Can you even fit
them in a two-shot?

1146
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,595
They are so tall. I'm practically
melting over here.

1147
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,396
Isn't she a loud, loud girl?

1148
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,838
"Julie Criscoll,
aged 15, wanted

1149
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,878
nothing more than
to change the world."

1150
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,077
"If only all the politicians
would actually listen."

1151
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,033
Yeah, well that's Em.

1152
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,157
Is that Em? Yeah, that's Em.
She wrote the book.

1153
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,109
Emma?

1154
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,429
It's me.

1155
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,873
I'm so sorry, darling.

1156
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,316
Look, how's the party going?
How's it all going?

1157
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,709
Um...

1158
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,956
We're all going on
to some club. How is she?

1159
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,792
Asleep. You know, finally.

1160
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,195
She's been awake
all this time?

1161
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,192
Yeah, my fault. I should
have given her the decaf.

1162
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,474
See? There you go.
I made you laugh.

1163
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,513
Are you all right?

1164
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,870
Yeah.
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

1165
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,109
Why? Were you worried?

1166
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,349
Oh, no. Um...

1167
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,396
No reason. I just...

1168
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,310
Well, I was just
checking up on you and...

1169
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,753
well, everything's fine.

1170
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,033
All right.

1171
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,718
Look, Sylvie,

1172
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,792
I know I'm not good at all this,
you know, dad/husband thing.

1173
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,309
You're doing fine, Dexter.

1174
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,391
No, and I know
if you had a receipt,

1175
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,755
you would have taken
me back a long time ago.

1176
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,874
But, you know, I'm working on it,
all right? So bear with me. That's all.

1177
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,758
I've got to go.

1178
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,031
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

1179
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,076
Night.
Good night.

1180
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,875
Funny?

1181
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,989
Very funny.

1182
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,519
Well, look at you.
You even look like a writer.

1183
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,151
A writer in Paris.

1184
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,191
There's a word for this,
isn't there?

1185
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,077
Uh, butch.

1186
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,878
I was gonna say gamine.

1187
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,868
What do you look like?

1188
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,916
Me? A screwed-up divorce.

1189
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,274
So my apartment's not far.
Shall we?

1190
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,516
How long are you staying for?

1191
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,672
I suppose it's up to you,
really. It's just...

1192
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,357
Look, I just wanted
to say something

1193
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,232
which I couldn't
really do over the phone.

1194
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,515
Well, ever since we were
last together in London...

1195
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,797
Dexter, before you say
anything else, I have to...

1196
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,513
There's something
I have to tell you.

1197
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,628
You've met someone!

1198
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,551
Is that really
so hard to believe?

1199
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,471
A man?
Yes, a man. A guy.

1200
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,438
A guy! He's a guy now,
is he? I see.

1201
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,239
He's called Jean-Pierre,
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

1202
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,514
What, he's French?

1203
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,715
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

1204
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:29,160
He's handsome. He's charming.
He's just very, very French.

1205
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,071
What, you mean rude?

1206
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,718
No.
Arrogant?

1207
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,756
Smokes too much,
wears a string of onions.

1208
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,990
Why are you being like this?

1209
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,913
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what
you mean? You're having lots of sex?

1210
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,638
Since when do I need
to ask your permission?

1211
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,199
God knows
you never asked mine.

1212
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,875
But we just slept together.

1213
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,072
I haven't forgotten.

1214
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,835
Dexter, we got a bit drunk.

1215
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,512
Yeah, not that drunk.

1216
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,471
You took your trousers off
over your shoes.

1217
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,079
No, I didn't.

1218
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,549
Did I?

1219
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,315
I think that you were upset
about Sylvie and the divorce,

1220
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,795
and you needed
a shoulder to cry on.

1221
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,438
Or sleep with.

1222
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,069
And that's what I was,
a shoulder to sleep with.

1223
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,919
And that's why you did it, was it?
To cheer me up.

1224
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,149
Well, it worked, didn't it?

1225
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,669
If you must know, it was one of
the better nights of my life.

1226
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,988
See?

1227
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,558
Don't fish.

1228
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,036
Dex, it was one time.

1229
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,790
Well, it was three times.

1230
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,996
Come on. Look, you don't
think it's a good idea?

1231
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,798
You and me.

1232
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,031
I do. I did.

1233
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,235
In the late '80s.

1234
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,355
Right.

1235
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,073
Better get going.

1236
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,553
Why? What are we doing?

1237
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,993
Jean-Pierre wants to meet you.

1238
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,394
Oh, you're kidding.

1239
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,436
We're going to hear him play.

1240
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,555
Play?

1241
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,629
He's a jazz musician.

1242
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,429
Bastard.

1243
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,478
We're going to listen to him play free
jazz on the piano for about nine hours,

1244
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,313
and it's going to be lots of
fun and in no way awkward.

1245
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,559
You're not going out
like that, are you?

1246
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,313
Just do me up.

1247
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,279
That's Jean-Pierre.

1248
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,509
Where?

1249
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,873
Oh, God. You could have at least
found someone a bit good-looking.

1250
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,112
You know, Em, I'm sure he's
a fine jazz pianist.

1251
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,316
I just don't think
I can do this.

1252
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,474
Oh. Really?

1253
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,076
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie
and go back to the apartment.

1254
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,715
And then I think I'm going to get
the first train back tomorrow.

1255
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,074
You don't have to leave.

1256
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,514
I think I do.

1257
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,591
I'm sorry, Dex.

1258
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,035
Hey, don't be.

1259
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,588
Go on.

1260
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,271
Salut.
Hey.

1261
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,875
Wait! Dexter!

1262
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,956
I thought I got rid of you.

1263
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,911
If you muck me about,
Dexter...

1264
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,996
Em, I swear.
I swear I won't.

1265
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,270
Lead me on, or let me down,
or go behind my back,

1266
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,509
I will murder you.

1267
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,635
I won't do that.

1268
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,159
You swear?

1269
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,916
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

1270
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,918
I would like to thank everyone
for coming to our wedding.

1271
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,198
For what can only be described
as a whirlwind romance.

1272
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,429
Pause for laughter.

1273
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,718
Seriously, when people ask
how Emma and I first met,

1274
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,752
I tell them that
we grew up together.

1275
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,911
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

1276
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,991
You're not going to say,
"Blah, blah, blah," on the day, are you?

1277
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,274
You are not supposed
to be hearing this.

1278
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,475
What if I have notes?

1279
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,715
Come on, let me see.

1280
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,279
No, no.

1281
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,555
When we're married, you're
going to have to obey me.

1282
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,234
Yeah, I'm sure
that's going to happen.

1283
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,910
What? Not again?

1284
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,433
You don't mind, do you?

1285
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,033
No, I don't mind.

1286
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,752
Although, there are
health and safety issues.

1287
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,710
I could lose my license.

1288
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,434
They'll wonder
where we've got to.

1289
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,469
Mmm! Mmm.

1290
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,677
I can definitely
smell burning.

1291
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,675
Hello, hello.

1292
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,949
Hi, there.

1293
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,634
Come here, you.
Here we go.

1294
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,678
Do you want to give me a big kiss?
Give me a big kiss.

1295
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,512
Go on.

1296
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,398
TV between 5:30 and 6:00,
but no more.

1297
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,311
And she has to
be in bed by 7:30.

1298
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,311
All right,
do you want to run inside?

1299
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,879
Go see Emma. Good girl.

1300
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,234
I'm out here, Jasmine.

1301
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,709
She's loving coming
here at the moment.

1302
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,034
Well, good. That's great.

1303
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,759
I'm really pleased for you.

1304
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,353
Look, I'd invite you in.
It's just...

1305
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,750
No, it's fine. We've got
to go and see my family.

1306
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,512
Have fun.
Thanks.

1307
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,836
In you get,
Moriarty.

1308
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,477
Dexter?
Yeah.

1309
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,391
I've been thinking.

1310
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,073
So have I.

1311
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,190
I want a child
with the man I love.

1312
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,792
And if he won't do it,
then I want one with you.

1313
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,472
Well, then,
we'd better get started.

1314
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,232
I look so tired.

1315
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,675
So take some exercise.
Come swimming with me later.

1316
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,150
No, no, I can't. I've got to
do too much at the cafe.

1317
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,832
Fine. Don't.

1318
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,755
By the way, in case you're interested,
I'm not pregnant.

1319
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,439
Em, how do you know?

1320
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,119
How do you think?

1321
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,838
We could try again, though.

1322
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,317
Come on, look...
No, no, no, no. Come on.

1323
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,119
Look, I'm sorry.
All right?

1324
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,748
No, I am
for taking it out on you.

1325
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,914
We're not at our best today,
are we?

1326
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,553
Listen, why don't we meet
each other after work?

1327
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,871
We'll go to the movies.
Your choice.

1328
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,871
Something with subtitles.

1329
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,319
Ooh.

1330
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,914
And we can go and have
some dinner. Just you and me,

1331
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,993
and we can work this out.
All right?

1332
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,433
I promise.
Mmm-hmm.

1333
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,913
Yeah.

1334
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,149
Okay.

1335
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,871
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

1336
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:36,756
Hey, there. Just to say I'm running late,
but I'm on my way.

1337
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,752
I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

1338
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,514
Hey, there. Just to say I'm
running late, but I'm on my way.

1339
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,076
And I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

1340
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,357
I just wanted to say you're
a fine thing, Dexter Mayhew.

1341
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,396
I love you very much.

1342
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,074
Okay, there you go. Lucky you!

1343
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,189
Dad.

1344
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,152
Dexter?
Hello, darling.

1345
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,358
Jasmine!

1346
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,752
Are you all right?
Go and get dressed.

1347
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,279
Sylvie, Sylvie.
Dexter?

1348
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,670
Sylvie, Sylvie,
I screwed up.

1349
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,829
Jasmine, now!

1350
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,592
I screwed up.

1351
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,312
It's all right.
You're all right.

1352
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,158
No, I screwed up.

1353
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,077
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on.

1354
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,232
I'm so sorry.

1355
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,389
It's all right.

1356
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,959
Aw, Dex, come on.

1357
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,555
You poor thing.

1358
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,428
Oh, God. Dexter.

1359
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,153
As the rain came down,
the water levels began to rise.

1360
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:17,837
So is this going to be an
annual festival, do you think?

1361
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,834
Every year, 15th of July?

1362
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,914
Well, I hope not.

1363
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,434
I don't want a heart-to-heart.

1364
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,949
Do you?

1365
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,759
No, no. I'd rather not.

1366
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,594
Except to say, that I think
the best thing that you could do

1367
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,796
would be to try to live your
life as if Emma was still here.

1368
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,839
Don't you?

1369
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,109
I don't know if I can.

1370
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,553
Of course you can.

1371
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,074
What do you think I've been
doing for the past 10 years?

1372
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:17,639
Now Silent witness is on.
9:00.

1373
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,233
Right.

1374
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,999
Ian. God!

1375
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,069
Dexter.

1376
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,832
Hi.
Hello, mate.

1377
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,309
Are you well?
Yeah, look at this.

1378
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,835
So, how are you?
How's the stand-up comedy?

1379
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,751
Oh, well,
I gave that up, actually.

1380
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,915
That's a shame.

1381
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,515
No, not really,
because I was never any good.

1382
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,511
The only time
I ever made Emma laugh

1383
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,068
was when I fell down
the stairs. Really.

1384
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,397
No, I'm in insurance now.

1385
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,591
Great, great.

1386
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,351
I hate today.
Fifteenth of July.

1387
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,596
Saint Swithin's Day.

1388
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,233
It's a tough one.

1389
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:24,316
I never noticed it before, but it was
always there just waiting, lurking.

1390
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,031
I used to hate you, too.

1391
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,476
Quite violently, actually, Dexter.
No, I'm sorry, but...

1392
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,588
Because, she lit up with you.

1393
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,951
Just in a way that
she never would with me,

1394
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,112
and it used to make me
so angry because...

1395
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,238
I didn't think that you deserved her.
Can I say this?

1396
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,038
Yeah, go on.

1397
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,878
She made you decent.

1398
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,552
And then in return,
you made her so happy.

1399
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,079
So happy.

1400
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:09,557
And I will always be
grateful to you for that.

1401
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:18,269
And on that bombshell,
back to the sticks.

1402
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,112
There's my lot out there.
Oh! Look at them.

1403
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,958
Yeah, I know.

1404
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,832
So, listen, we'll stay in touch.
I'll give you a call.

1405
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:30,674
No, I don't think that's necessary.
I think we're done here.

1406
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,354
Come here.

1407
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,788
Good luck, mate. All right?

1408
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,188
You, too.

1409
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,599
Thank you.

1410
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,353
You've got cake
everywhere.

1411
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,679
Wake up.

1412
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,279
Wake up.

1413
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,472
It's all right.
Don't panic. It's only me.

1414
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,233
Emma. Emma Morley.

1415
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,879
Yes. Hello.

1416
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,279
So what do you suggest we do?

1417
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,315
We could stay in touch.

1418
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,437
Today. We're meant
to be doing something today.

1419
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,678
Right. Right, right.

1420
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,873
Look, today's a bit
tricky for me, really.

1421
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,474
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

1422
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,670
Well, I'm meeting my parents,
and then I've got to get back...

1423
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,513
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you should probably go then.

1424
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,954
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye, now.

1425
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:52,200
Look, that's not until later,
so if you wanted to,

1426
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,360
we could go for
a walk or something?

1427
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,275
Okay.

1428
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,870
Come on, keep up.

1429
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,953
It's these shoes. I can't
mountain climb in brogues.

1430
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,318
It's not K2. It's just a big hill,
all right? A child could do it.

1431
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:34,159
I don't want you thinking I'm bothered
or anything about last night.

1432
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:38,233
I don't want your phone number,
or letters, or postcards.

1433
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,072
I don't want to
get married to you.

1434
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,549
Definitely don't want
to have your babies.

1435
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,473
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we've had today.

1436
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,278
And if we should
bump into each other
sometime in the future,

1437
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,271
well, that's fine, too.

1438
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,317
We'll be friends.

1439
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,397
Yeah, right.

1440
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,797
Or, you know,
on the other hand...

1441
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,508
Go on.

1442
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,193
Well, my parents
don't arrive until later.

1443
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,239
So?

1444
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,551
So, well, the flat's empty.

1445
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,516
You know, if you wanted
to finish what we started.

1446
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,798
What? Sober?

1447
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,354
Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,198
And in daylight.

1449
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,629
Race you!

1450
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,992
Do you want a piggy-back,
you old man?

1451
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,073
It's these shoes. There's no
blooming grip on these things.

1452
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,957
Here, come here, you.

1453
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,714
Did you come up
here with Emma?

1454
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,989
Yeah, once.

1455
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,275
That was a long time ago now.

1456
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,833
Do you miss her?

1457
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,359
Well, of course, I do.

1458
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,075
She was...
She was my best friend.

1459
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,196
Who's your best
friend now then?

1460
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,312
Well, you are, of course.
Come here.

1461
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,158
Why, who's yours?

1462
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,709
I think it's probably Mum.

1463
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,669
Yeah.

1464
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,717
I'm not so terrible though, am I?

1465
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,677
I'm not answering that.

1466
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,997
You know what you are.

1467
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,000
It's just round the corner.
This way.

1468
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,229
Oh, Dexter!

1469
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,117
Damn it, they're early.

1470
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,548
You're early.

1471
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,915
We thought we'd surprise you.

1472
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,672
Clearly, we have.

1473
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,189
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley.
Morley.

1474
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,599
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

1475
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,796
Emma, you'll join us
for tea, yes?

1476
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,077
No, no, thanks.
I should leave you to it.

1477
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,674
Are you going to go?
Yeah. Well,

1478
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,314
pleasure to meet you and...

1479
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,789
Well, have a nice life.

1480
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,029
Okay.

1481
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,913
I'm sorry. Did we
just interrupt something?

1482
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,874
No, no.
Emma's just a good friend.

1483
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,638
Weren't you
wearing this yesterday?

1484
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,679
The rascal.

1485
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,032
Emma! Em!

1486
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,873
Em, wait! Wait, wait.

1487
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,517
Look, I need your phone number.

1488
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,910
My number?
Right. Of course.

1489
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,513
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of that.

1490
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,229
I wasn't expecting them until after we...
Well, you know.

1491
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:39,714
Right.

1492
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,874
This is me in Edinburgh.

1493
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,274
Right.

1494
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,992
My parents' number

1495
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,276
and their address just in case.

1496
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,634
Right.

1497
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,117
Oh. Dad's got
a fax machine at work.

1498
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,873
Just the phone number's fine.

1499
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,188
Thank you.

1500
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,389
Look, I've got to go.

1501
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,549
I know.

1502
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,759
But we will see
each other again.

1503
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,439
I know we will.

1504
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,234
Goodbye, Dex.

1505
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,879
Goodbye.

1506
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,388
Goodbye.
