26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,899
Last night I had an ugly nightmare.

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,218
Oh, yeah?

28
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,318
What happened, man?

29
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,927
I'm lying down in my bed.

30
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:14,767
Then I get up...

31
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,319
and there's my mother,
may she rest in peace...

32
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,193
seated in a chair
with a plastic bag over her head...

33
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,547
and she can't breathe.

34
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,842
And I can't help her.

35
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,428
Fuck.

36
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,360
What do we do?

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,840
We'll give them a half hour.

38
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,263
Who are they?

39
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,821
Don't worry.
It's just the police.

40
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,267
This is a private road.

41
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,166
You have to have a permit.

42
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,292
Do you have a permit?

43
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:21,618
- I don't have a permit.

44
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:23,693
Do you have a permit?

45
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:27,025
Well, then, we have a problem.

46
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,125
Can we buy a permit?

47
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,915
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.

48
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:36,043
How much?
- Four hundred pesos.

49
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,088
You too-- 400 pesos.

50
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,228
What's underneath the tarp?

51
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,774
Boxes of food.
- Show me.

52
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:21,761
Lay down on the ground, sweetie.
You're under arrest.

53
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,682
Yeah, you guys are screwed.

54
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,429
What's your name?

55
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,722
Javier RodrÌguez RodrÌguez.

56
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:46,900
Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.

57
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,074
You've done an excellent job.

58
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,164
But we'll take over from here.

59
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:06,593
Put the prisoners in the Suburban
and impound the truck.

60
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,439
How did you find out about this?

61
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,653
A little bird told me.

62
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,753
What's the name ofyour little bird?

63
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,995
It doesn't have a name.

64
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,083
Those fucking anonymous ones.

65
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:43,339
For an officer of the state police...

66
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,636
you're very well-informed.

67
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:01,361
Hey, was that General Salazar?
- The Big Boss himself.

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,305
What is he doing around here?

69
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,955
Up to something. I don't know.

70
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,455
They took our handcuffs, Manolo.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,038
This informant, paid by police,
using taxpayers' dollars...

72
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,740
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

73
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,744
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm,

74
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:27,965
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

75
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:31,845
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

76
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,885
whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.

77
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,009
Mr. Rodman...

78
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:40,396
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

79
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,690
in choosing what he planted...

80
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,236
as he did in choosing his attorney,

81
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:47,396
but, lately,
the only variation...

82
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:51,651
I'm hearing in your argument
is the name of your client.

83
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:55,405
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,

84
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,499
but you're not gonna convince me...

85
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,121
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

86
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,712
Furthermore,
there is no sacred protection...

87
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,751
of property rights in our country.

88
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:11,781
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre,

89
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,076
that farm can be seized...

90
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,404
and that farm can be sold.

91
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,408
What the hell is that?

92
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:25,670
You can tell a lot about somebody
from this stuff.

93
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,843
It's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

94
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:29,694
A fishing rod.

95
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:33,615
What do you think they want?
- Depends what state they're from.

96
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,594
Uh... Arizona.

97
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,430
Arizona.

98
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,750
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

99
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,850
Or am I being cynical?

100
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:47,272
Mark... I'm gonna miss you.

101
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:50,203
Thank you for all your hard work.

102
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,243
Hi. How are you today?

103
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,868
You've got a daughter.
Why is it important to get...

104
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,023
a handle on this drug problem?

105
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:05,693
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

106
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:10,213
But I'm planning on being
back here as much as I can.

107
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,309
How do you feel about--

108
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:40,066
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose,

109
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,193
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

110
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,195
I got it.
- You got it, babe.

111
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,408
I'm cool, man.
You just don't tell any jokes.

112
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,467
' Don't tell any jokes'?
- Don't tell jokes.

113
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,578
It's a giveaway, Ray.

114
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:52,684
It's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke,

115
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:53,414
it's a giveaway.

116
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:55,422
Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is?

117
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:56,418
You are too uptight, man.

118
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:58,920
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

119
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,090
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

120
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,092
Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

121
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:06,137
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

122
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,907
Can I get it?
Can I get it?

123
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:13,112
Oh, baby, can I say it?
- Say it. It's show time.

124
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,245
We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.
We have a 2:00 appointment.

125
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,948
He's right down the hallway
in the back room.

126
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,048
Thank you.

127
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,352
Come in. Hey, fellas.

128
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,463
Come on, you guys. Get him talking.

129
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,775
Get him outside.
- How you doing?

130
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,705
I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

131
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,809
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

132
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,592
You guys ever bought a quarter ton before?

133
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,832
No?
- I don't think so.

134
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:56,836
It's a big fucking deal, all right?

135
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,864
It's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

136
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,789
How many peasants is that
gonna take? You'd have a line...

137
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:01,659
from here to Mexico City.

138
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,374
You say show up at a time, we show up at
the time and we're fucking sitting here.

139
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,552
Sure I can't offer you something to drink?

140
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:10,669
I can offer you ajoke.

141
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,140
You want to hear a joke? I got
a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,476
It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
I'm gonna tell you a joke.

143
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:20,822
All right, why are hurricane
named after women?

144
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:23,042
I don't know.
- Because when they arrive.

145
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:24,184
they're wet and wild.

146
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:28,535
When they leave, they take
your house and your car.

147
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,442
It's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

148
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,542
I chuckled. Damn.

149
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,507
Fellas... that's us.
- Yo.

150
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:47,338
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move until they get Ruiz outside.

151
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,430
I told you there was nothing to worry about.

152
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,357
I got another joke.

153
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,934
Come on. Please.
- Just one more. Relax.

154
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,396
A guy goes, gets a tattoo put on his penis.

155
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,107
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

156
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,401
On his penis?
- Yeah. The words 'yes' and 'no.'

157
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,895
So, his wife says, 'Hold it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house--'

158
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,744
Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

159
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,681
What the fuck is going--

160
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,975
Shit. Agent down.

161
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Get in there now. Go.

162
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,246
D.E.A..

163
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,042
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

164
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,095
Go. Shit.

165
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:32,555
Shit.

166
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:39,916
I think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, I think so too.

167
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:45,203
Don't fucking move.
Get your hands-- Move.

168
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,249
Get out, you son of a bitch.
Get out.

169
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:51,729
Is this what they wear to go to sleep...

170
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,757
or do they hang out like this
the whole time?

171
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:59,012
That would be sleep attire.
- It's like a smoking jacket.

172
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,473
He's gonna be smoking in a minute.

173
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,561
Okay, who's the father of
Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?

174
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,188
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
His trilogy? The Oresteia.

175
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:12,027
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--
Can anyone stop the Seth machine?

176
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,798
No.
- That's correct. Score.

177
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,304
And 'tragedy' is closed out.

178
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,310
But wait.

179
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:29,438
Is he her husband?
- Yes.

180
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

181
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:36,736
Yeah.

182
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,003
What are you doing?
- Just watch.

183
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:08,383
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

184
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,552
What is this, like freebase?

185
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,572
Not 'like.' It is.

186
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,713
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

187
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:27,129
Hold it.
Hold it.

188
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,257
See?

189
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,137
Now you see.

190
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,631
Oh, how-- Oh, they're doing great.

191
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,434
Look at how cute they are.

192
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,963
Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

193
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:22,025
Little Tiger, I hope.

194
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,770
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

195
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,772
So will his bank balance.

196
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:29,809
My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

197
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,145
Helena, you never order duck.
- I know, I know.

198
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:35,971
It's not me who ordered it.
It's somebody else.

199
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,652
Well, he or she has very good taste.

200
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:40,059
I love duck, don't you?
- It's delicious.

201
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,030
Do you want some, Nan?

202
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,176
Oh, yes. Thank you.
- It's such a fatty bird.

203
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:46,981
There's good cholesterol,
and there's bad cholesterol,

204
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:47,871
which is confusing to me.

205
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,667
Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

206
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,920
It's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

207
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,840
You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

208
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,842
I'm European.
I say that to my doctor.

209
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:02,012
'I'm European.
I'm allowed to drink red wine.'

210
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,390
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when I was pregnant.

211
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,493
A glass a week.
- After my amnio,

212
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:09,854
he said, 'Okay, now you can go
and have a glass ofred wine.'

213
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:13,208
I had two....

214
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,507
Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:20,766
Thanks a lot.
- Can I bring the bag...

216
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:21,534
in the backwith me?

217
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:24,412
No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

218
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,707
Give me the putter.
- All right.

219
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,867
In you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

220
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,731
Put this down here, okay?

221
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:35,342
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

222
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:38,528
You're welcome.
- Okay.

223
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:44,227
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

224
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,327
Okay.

225
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:51,235
Until you officially take over the
Office of National Drug Control Policy,

226
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:54,322
under no circumstances will you speak
to the press unprotected...

227
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,333
without going through this office...

228
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,743
or having someone in the room.

229
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:01,122
There are a lot of interests in this town.

230
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:03,124
Right now,
they're scared of you.

231
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:06,156
The reason they're scared
of you: Technically, you have...

232
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:07,920
veto powers over their budgets.

233
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,424
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,

234
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,801
each with a specially prepared question.

235
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:16,431
They're questions designed for
one thing-- to make them look smart.

236
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,850
If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

237
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,436
If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.

238
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,940
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

239
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,943
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

240
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:31,489
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

241
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:34,172
Also, one month from today,
you will give your first...

242
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:35,535
official press conference.

243
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:40,466
In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

244
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:43,502
Judge, I just want to be
clear about one thing:

245
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,839
I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.

246
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,467
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me.

247
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,178
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

248
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:54,599
the most important ofwhich,
in my opinion, Mexico.

249
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,852
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

250
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,147
It is important that they like you.

251
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,491
It is not important that they like me.

252
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,152
That is why I can help protect you.

253
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,964
Like you protected Landry?

254
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,367
I see where you're going with that.

255
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:14,538
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

256
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,124
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

257
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,178
There's a political component
to this job that the general...

258
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:21,755
didn't have any patience for.

259
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,328
General, Bob Wakefield.

260
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,883
General, Bob Wakefield.

261
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:28,104
Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

262
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:32,492
Jeff, you want to excuse us?

263
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:35,112
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

264
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,698
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

265
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,784
You've done a fine job, General.

266
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:42,404
The Office of National Drug Control Policy...

267
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:45,031
is in better shape than when you found it.

268
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:48,201
I'm not sure I made the slightest difference.

269
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,722
I tried. I really did.

270
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,750
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

271
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,129
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

272
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,629
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

273
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,137
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

274
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,565
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

275
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:12,256
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

276
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,584
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

277
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,947
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

278
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:26,787
He said, 'When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

279
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:30,416
'open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

280
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:33,629
'And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

281
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,772
open the second letter.'

282
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:39,134
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

283
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:44,766
so he opened the first letter,
which said, ' Blame everything on me.'

284
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:47,645
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

285
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,314
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

286
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,316
and he opened the second letter.

287
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,963
It said, 'Sit down and write two letters.'

288
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,637
Yeah.

289
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,512
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

290
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,968
It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen.

291
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,308
I want to file a report.

292
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,521
A report will not help you find your car.

293
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:28,991
The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

294
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:33,403
You call this man...
and he'll find your car.

295
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,748
I don't get it.

296
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,702
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

297
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:39,927
The police will tell him.

298
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:42,540
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

299
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,551
Because we pay him, stupid.

300
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:47,379
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

301
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,516
Es correct.
Es correct.

302
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:54,272
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

303
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,056
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

304
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:59,643
No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

305
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:03,397
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

306
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:06,501
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

307
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,900
Javier Rodriguez.
- Si.

308
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,909
We want you to come with us.

309
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:40,372
Where?
- It's just a short trip.

310
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:44,494
Follow me.

311
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:46,594
Bien.

312
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,845
I would say one thing to you, Judge,

313
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,298
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

314
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:05,969
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities.

315
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,521
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

316
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,503
We in the legal drug business--
Merck and Pfizer and the rest...

317
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,977
of my very important clients--...

318
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,920
realize that we're not fighting
a war here with a traditional...

319
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,855
winner and loser.

320
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:18,858
I don't know that you can win this war.

321
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,860
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

322
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,331
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs--...

323
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:27,011
If you reduce that to 10,
that's a great improvement.

324
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:27,368
Right.

325
00:23:27,468 --> 00:23:29,829
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

326
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:32,958
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

327
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:35,239
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

328
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:37,671
The price of coke and heroin has dropped,

329
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,475
but purity has increased.

330
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,733
All this law enforcement
has really achieved is that...

331
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,053
kids get better stuff cheaper.

332
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:46,723
Education, rehabilitation,
prevention--...

333
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:48,726
that's not significant to these reporters.

334
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,728
Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

335
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:53,781
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

336
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:55,784
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

337
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,636
I look forward to working
with you in the future.

338
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,194
Well, call me.

339
00:23:58,294 --> 00:23:59,843
I have a good bill on treatment-on-demand.

340
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:00,697
I could use your help.

341
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:02,715
Wonderful. Look forward to it.
Thanks, Senator.

342
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:03,284
Okay. Great.

343
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:06,254
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth.

344
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,256
I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

345
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,259
Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

346
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,711
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

347
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,713
I don't care who you have to deal with.

348
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:17,862
If you're independent and you
use that bully pulpit right.

349
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:19,427
that's where your power is.

350
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,429
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

351
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,557
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

352
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,657
Addicts don't vote.

353
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,055
What the hell are you doing here?

354
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:38,758
You like your view?

355
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:42,678
TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

356
00:24:45,557 --> 00:24:48,085
Hope it's all good because this
is as good as it's gonna get...

357
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,896
for a long time, Eduardo.

358
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:54,350
I'm a legitimate businessman.
I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.

359
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,352
Check it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

360
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,813
Fucking can it, bitch.
- You can't come in here like that.

361
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,441
I want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

362
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,077
It's cool, man.

363
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:07,324
Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- It's cool.

364
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,990
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep--...

365
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,261
that's capital punishment
in some states, right?

366
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:17,326
Yeah, down in Texas.

367
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,328
They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

368
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,331
We've got him making the deal on tape.

369
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,292
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

370
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,837
We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

371
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:28,938
No, no, he's fucked.

372
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:36,433
I only see one way out of this predicament.

373
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:45,984
You make us believe you got a boss, Eddie.

374
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:48,829
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

375
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,930
No.

376
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:53,868
No, that's a death sentence.
I'd never make it to the trial.

377
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:57,840
Look, we're gonna protect you.

378
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,255
Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

379
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,881
That's a big word for a fisherman.

380
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,900
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

381
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,155
I know another big word.

382
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,323
Immunity.

383
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,330
Take it easy, will you?

384
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,285
What's going on in here?

385
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,093
We have a warrant
to search your premises.

386
00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:25,404
What?

387
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:27,506
Carl.

388
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,675
My husband.

389
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl.

390
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:34,131
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

391
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:36,967
David, come here.
- Ma'am, I have a search warrant.

392
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,794
He'll be back.

393
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:43,232
Where are they taking Daddy?

394
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:45,357
He'll be all right.

395
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,231
He's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

396
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:51,225
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

397
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,602
I don't understand what's going on.
- He'll be all right.

398
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:56,272
What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

399
00:26:56,372 --> 00:27:00,043
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.

400
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,505
Not you.

401
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,605
You.

402
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,195
I'll wait here.

403
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:29,409
Five years with the Tijuana police.

404
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,082
Three years in the state police.

405
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:41,841
Your parents died when their house
flooded in the rains of '93.

406
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,263
How unfortunate.

407
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:55,898
You make $316 a month.

408
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:00,279
That's what they pay.

409
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,029
Well, look.

410
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:09,747
This could be your past.

411
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:16,380
We can talk about your future...

412
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:21,219
if you can do me a favor.

413
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:23,678
If I can.

414
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:32,315
I want to wipe out the Tijuana cartel.

415
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,906
What can I do to help?

416
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,622
His name is Francisco Flores.

417
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:48,541
He's an assassin.

418
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:52,338
He runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.

419
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:56,425
I have to talk to him.

420
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,972
I need you to find him and bring him here.

421
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:05,833
This is crazy.
- Don't freak out, Manolo.

422
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:09,313
Don't you know who 'Frankie Flowers' is?

423
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,730
A hired assassin. A psychopath.
Fucking crazy.

424
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:19,310
Who knows how many he's killed.
- Then I'll go by myself.

425
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,655
And we can't ask for help...

426
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:24,305
because he lives in San Diego.

427
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:34,050
Ah.

428
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:38,432
Well... is this a surprise or what?

429
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,601
An honor.
Thank you.

430
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:42,937
Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

431
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:45,345
How are you?
- Good trip. I'm good.

432
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:46,924
I just can't believe this.

433
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:50,612
What's Washington like?
- It's like, uh--

434
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,807
It's like Calcutta; surrounded by beggars.

435
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:56,811
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

436
00:29:56,911 --> 00:30:00,651
and they don't say 'please' and 'thank you.'

437
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,904
So, we put
the case before the arbitration panel,

438
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,373
none of whom have any expertise.

439
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,376
'Superfund' is just one of those words.

440
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,378
People stop paying attention.

441
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:15,850
It's frustrating.
- It's so frustrating.

442
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:17,877
Did you meet the president?

443
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:20,546
Honey, your father knows the president.

444
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:23,550
It just so happens... that
the president of the United States,

445
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,552
my new boss,
the leader of the free world,

446
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:28,731
has penciled me in for a little face time.

447
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:32,173
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

448
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:37,165
Caroline.
- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

449
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,211
It's great.
It's great, Daddy.

450
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:43,881
It's just amazing, that's all.

451
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,721
Arnie, thank God.

452
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:54,031
Helena, I am so--

453
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:56,212
Please tell me what's going on here.

454
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,216
What is going on? They came into
the house. They just took him away.

455
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,894
They searched my home.

456
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:05,649
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

457
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,202
First of all, Carl is not here.

458
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,704
The D.E.A. has got him.

459
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,899
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment,

460
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,444
which will probably be tomorrow.

461
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:20,414
So here you are wasting your time.
All right? Are you with me?

462
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:23,994
Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

463
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:26,555
over the telephone.

464
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,959
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

465
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,795
What is he charged with, Arnie?
- I don't know,

466
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:37,676
but under no circumstances
am I going to talk about it here.

467
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:41,947
Now, you go home and be with your son.
All right?

468
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:38,635
Miss?

469
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:40,712
Can I have a Budweiser?

470
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:52,236
Excuse me.
- Yes?

471
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,406
Can you give me a cigarette?

472
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,774
It would be interesting to know
how you did it so quickly.

473
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,105
We all have our weak side.

474
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:05,652
The path of the Lord is very subtle.

475
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:08,070
Amen.

476
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,915
What a badass.

477
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:26,593
All I'm saying--
What I'm-- What I'm saying is...

478
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,998
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

479
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:35,437
We all look at each other
and nod with these--...

480
00:34:35,604 --> 00:34:41,477
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

481
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,680
Responses-- Not real responses.

482
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,827
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles;

483
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,988
surface bullshit.

484
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,165
Do I ever just say:

485
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,962
' Hey... I'm uncomfortable in this crowd.'

486
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,531
'I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either.'

487
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:03,869
'l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because--'

488
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,682
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

489
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,709
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

490
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,712
like our parents seem
and their parents before them.

491
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:15,049
I'm sorry I have to be the one
to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.

492
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:16,721
For instance?
- I know you jack off...

493
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:17,885
to Caroline every night,

494
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,055
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

495
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:23,895
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

496
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:25,895
Because what is that convention?

497
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:27,275
We're this random collection
of self interests,

498
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,272
and all of a sudden we decide...

499
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:32,944
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?

500
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:36,782
Actually, for your information,
when I jerk off.

501
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:40,244
I'm not just thinking about Caroline,
I'm thinking about you with Caroline.

502
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:43,055
So, how about that?
- Baby--

503
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:49,730
That is what I'm talking about-- sarcasm.

504
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:53,066
Always fucking sarcasm.

505
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,763
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that,

506
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,307
people will think that you are weak...

507
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,453
or they won't like you...

508
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:06,107
or whatever it is you think will happen, but--

509
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:10,445
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

510
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,545
Wh-What?

511
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:17,803
Because you are so fucking right.

512
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,131
I'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

513
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:22,475
Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

514
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,603
Why don't we...

515
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:28,440
change this thing,
this social pattern?

516
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:30,175
Why don't we be different?

517
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,228
Yeah.
- But then why are you...

518
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,805
even talking about it?

519
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,141
But we're making it,
like, from now on.

520
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:39,829
You're like,
'Why don't we do something?'

521
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:42,365
Why don't you do something?
- That's what I'm saying, Seth.

522
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,603
You do it yourself--
- I'm saying if you knew it.

523
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,861
you wouldn't even say it.

524
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,871
Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.

525
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:52,176
It's a social pattern, you know?

526
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:59,977
Spence, baby, are you all right?

527
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:02,087
He's fucking blue.
He isn't breathing.

528
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:05,224
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

529
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:08,645
Wait--
- What the fuck do we do?

530
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:12,065
Uh-- Oh, God--
- Fuck.

531
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:16,062
Somebody call a doctor.
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

532
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:18,531
No, he's a research--
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

533
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:21,410
What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

534
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,745
Call your dad.
He's a neurosurgeon.

535
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,914
I can't call my dad.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

536
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:30,036
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something.

537
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:35,066
No, he can't die on the floor.
His parents are in Barbados.

538
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:46,402
Move. Move.

539
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:08,763
Okay, nobody has anything on them, right?

540
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,888
Fuck.

541
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:23,440
We know that you killed
our chief of intelligence.

542
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,700
We also know that you...

543
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:32,916
killed police chiefs
in Tijuana and Mexico City.

544
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,210
A question.

545
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,172
Why do you resist?

546
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,558
My father has money.

547
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:51,019
That is not the correct answer.

548
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,108
We also found out...

549
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:59,020
that you hunted down a neighbor of General Salazar.

550
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,691
A poor peasant.

551
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:04,936
Your people killed his granddaughter.

552
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:08,795
That was a stupid thing to do.

553
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,543
You fucked up.

554
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,733
I'm on the board of my son's school.

555
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:14,573
I have fund-raisers for adult literacy at my own home.

556
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:21,114
I think I have a right to know if
my husband is a legitimate businessman.

557
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:23,750
Of course he is.

558
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,250
I've known Carl for 20 years.

559
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:28,406
He doesn't even jaywalk.

560
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:37,737
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

561
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:40,294
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A.,

562
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:45,580
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

563
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:52,116
Carl is very, very good at his business.

564
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,958
Which is smuggling illegal drugs
into this country.

565
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:14,116
They're whispering.

566
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,127
They're whispering.

567
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:15,501
I know.

568
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,656
Can't hear it.
- I know. The fucking bug's...

569
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:19,172
too far away from the room.

570
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:21,641
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

571
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:23,643
They're saying something.

572
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:26,230
Sounds like they're conspiring to conspire.

573
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,240
I can feel the lies vibrating from their home.

574
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,188
I don't think she's in on it, man.

575
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:36,858
Come on, I dream about this.
I have actual dreams about this.

576
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,028
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

577
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:41,083
White people. Hey.

578
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:42,857
- White people. I know, I know.

579
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,701
I don't think she's in on it, man.

580
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:48,680
She knows Arnie Metzger.

581
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:51,350
So does half of San Diego.

582
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,597
You want to bet?

583
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,236
- Get in your pocket.

584
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,381
I got--
- I love it. I love it when you do this.

585
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,685
How much you want to bet? How much?

586
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:00,410
- I got-- I got 12 bucks.

587
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,797
Okay, give me ten.

588
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,327
We'll make it even.

589
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,081
- Okay.

590
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:07,159
Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

591
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:14,459
How old are you?
- Sixteen.

592
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:18,172
Live with your parents?

593
00:42:18,297 --> 00:42:20,667
Yes.

594
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:22,767
Parents still together?

595
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,844
Yes.

596
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:30,227
Do you work?
- I volunteer.

597
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:34,815
I read to blind people, one day a week for two hours.

598
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,859
In school?

599
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,573
Yes.

600
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:42,698
Private?

601
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:44,774
Yeah.

602
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:48,748
How are your grades?

603
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:51,124
I'm third in my class.

604
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,605
- What does that mean?

605
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,634
I get A's, all A's.
- You do?

606
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,096
What else do you do?

607
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:03,499
I'm a National Merit Finalist.

608
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,595
I'm on the Hi-Q Team and the Math Team.

609
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:08,243
I'm in the Spanish Club.

610
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,364
I'm a thespian.

611
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,475
I'm vice president of my class.

612
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:14,871
I'm on the volleyball team.

613
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:23,370
You want to tell me what you're doing here, Caroline?

614
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,850
Carol.

615
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,814
Oh, sweetie.

616
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:51,735
You okay?

617
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,364
It's okay.

618
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:59,571
Caroline, how well did you know this boy that overdosed?

619
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:03,041
He didn't hang around us.

620
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,903
He was like one of those hippie kids.

621
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:08,298
I'm not part of that group.

622
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,180
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

623
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:19,894
He's a friend.

624
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:24,140
He's also the only one that was doing anything about the situation.

625
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,646
He definitely had a few beers, but...

626
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:30,890
it's not like he wanted to drive.

627
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,560
We just didn't know what else to do.

628
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,205
It wasn't my pot.

629
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:43,671
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

630
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:45,840
Alone.

631
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:56,728
I think she's lying.
- Me too.

632
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:59,422
So let's ground her, clip her wings:

633
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:02,802
school, scheduled activities till further notice.

634
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:08,115
Robert, honey, Caroline clearly used very bad judgment,

635
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,480
but don't you think spending a night in jail is punishment enough?

636
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,784
I mean, we've all had our moments.

637
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,232
Lord knows, I tried every drug there was--

638
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:21,030
I don't want to hear about that.

639
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,992
You experimented when you were in college.

640
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:25,994
Shall we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it was?

641
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:27,996
This is different.
- Why?

642
00:45:28,096 --> 00:45:29,297
She's 16 years old.

643
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:31,600
- I think she needs to find out...

644
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,336
for herself, on her own.

645
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:35,512
We have to allow her room to figure out--

646
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,006
You want to give her room?

647
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:39,227
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

648
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:43,514
I am not sending out the message that our family will accept this behavior...

649
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:45,615
because we do not.

650
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,809
Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want...

651
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:48,895
to push her away.

652
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:54,126
She has to know that we understand what she's exposed to.

653
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,227
How long have you known about this?

654
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,677
How long have you known?

655
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,638
Six months.

656
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:17,854
My technique is more profound than yours, Javier.

657
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:21,241
Much more profound.

658
00:46:21,783 --> 00:46:24,578
When he loves me like a father,

659
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:27,933
he will never tell anyone he was here.

660
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,030
He will give me the names of his superiors.

661
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:37,676
Then we get them and they too will give us names.

662
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:46,269
And eventually somebody will get us to Juan ObregÛn.

663
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:53,402
And on that day, the Tijuana cartel will fall.

664
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
What a disgrace.

665
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:15,773
What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.

666
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:20,224
It's all right. Salazar is here.

667
00:47:21,935 --> 00:47:25,188
You're among friends now.

668
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:29,473
This shameful treatment will stop immediately.

669
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:31,572
Guard.

670
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,821
Yes, General.

671
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:38,995
Are you responsible for this?

672
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,166
We are not savages.
- Yes, General.

673
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:45,096
Has he eaten?
- I don't know, sir.

674
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:48,674
Go get him some clothes.
- Yes, General.

675
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,665
Your Honor, this is a man who heads a large criminal organization...

676
00:47:55,765 --> 00:48:00,170
with international contacts we can only begin to understand.

677
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,840
Our case against him is very strong.

678
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,213
He is not a flight risk.

679
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,511
His flight is assured.

680
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:11,947
The people ask that Your Honor deny bail.
Thank you.

681
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:14,853
My client is no more a flight risk...

682
00:48:14,953 --> 00:48:17,073
than Your Honor or the able prosecutor.

683
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:19,192
He's a pillar of his community;

684
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:23,162
a family man with a wife and child living in La Jolla,

685
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:25,782
the communitywhere he has made his home for the past 20 years.

686
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:27,772
As our defense will quickly show,

687
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:29,774
my client is guilty of nothing more...

688
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:32,757
than being the handy target of an admitted criminal.

689
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:37,712
Therefore, we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

690
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:39,813
I'm going to deny bail.

691
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:14,088
I appreciate you coming in so early this morning.

692
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:16,465
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it.

693
00:49:16,565 --> 00:49:19,635
She's a minor. It probably would have expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

694
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:24,608
Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue for me. I'm sure you can understand.

695
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,311
Like I said, open container, P.I., misdemeanor possession.

696
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:30,314
It's easy to make it go away.

697
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:35,612
One thing bothers me: The kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

698
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:38,740
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

699
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,451
So I've got to ask: What's your daughter on?

700
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,847
I don't know what you mean.

701
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:49,185
I mean... have you asked her what kind of drugs she's tried?

702
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:54,773
No.

703
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:57,654
I don't know.

704
00:49:57,779 --> 00:50:00,497
Is she in any kind of therapy, professional help?

705
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,683
No, no, no. No way.

706
00:50:01,783 --> 00:50:06,544
My daughter is one of the leading students in her school.

707
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,379
Well, I hope it stays that way.

708
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,930
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.

709
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:26,762
I want you to clean out my schedule for the next three days.

710
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:31,008
Because I'm tired of talking to experts who've never left the beltway.

711
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,914
It's time to see the front lines.

712
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,930
Carlos Ayala started out in the family connection business--...

713
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,289
real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada.

714
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:16,936
hydroponic strawberries.

715
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:19,530
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers ofthe Tijuana cartel.

716
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,075
Using regression analysis, we made a study...

717
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:26,080
of the custom lines at the border and calculated the odds of a search.

718
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,241
The odds are not high, and we found variables to reduce those odds.

719
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:31,920
So, you pay off customs officials?

720
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,598
Well, you know, in Mexico...

721
00:51:35,723 --> 00:51:38,961
law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity.

722
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:41,681
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh--

723
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,884
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

724
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,762
Some get stopped. Enough get through.

725
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:47,796
It's not difficult.

726
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,358
Look, boys, this has worked for years.

727
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:53,002
It's gonna continue to work for years.

728
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,347
NAFTA makes things even more difficult for you because...

729
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,480
the border's disappearing.

730
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,760
Do you realize in the next year or two at the outside

731
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,152
Mexican trucking companies...

732
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:03,289
are gonna be able to go from the States to Mexico and back again...

733
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:07,300
with the same freedom as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

734
00:52:07,397 --> 00:52:09,272
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

735
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:11,430
- What, are we on Larry King...

736
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:12,540
or something?

737
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,969
Shit.

738
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:17,504
Tell us something we don't know, Eddie.

739
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:20,841
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

740
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:23,678
who think World War II is still going on.

741
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,870
Let me be the first to tell you,
your government surrendered...

742
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,225
this war a long time ago.

743
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:31,395
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help in front of a jury.

744
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,698
It's really a bad attitude.

745
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:35,600
- Very bad. Very bad.

746
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:41,170
Look, Ed, there's only one
problem with all this math.

747
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:42,517
You're in here.

748
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:45,337
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

749
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,680
Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

750
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:51,177
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

751
00:52:51,277 --> 00:52:53,712
Carl never would have been so stupid.

752
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:55,689
Well, Carl hired you.

753
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,592
That was a mistake.

754
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:04,892
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

755
00:53:04,992 --> 00:53:06,992
He was loyal.

756
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,569
Javi.

757
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:16,196
A group of us are going to a party.

758
00:53:16,296 --> 00:53:17,998
Who?

759
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:23,471
Esteban, Guzm·n, Tom·s,
all of them.

760
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,890
Your new buddies.

761
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,178
Yes.

762
00:53:29,278 --> 00:53:30,921
Let's go.
- No.

763
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,858
It'll be fun.
- Another day.

764
00:53:37,946 --> 00:53:41,575
At my house I have some B&W speakers.

765
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:46,155
A while ago I bought a CD burner.

766
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:50,127
I make CDs with the music I want.

767
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:54,381
Just like I bought them in a store.

768
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:57,228
You and I have a lot in common.

769
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:59,070
Not everything, but a lot.

770
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:03,396
We both studied on the other side
with the gringos.

771
00:54:04,727 --> 00:54:07,221
Your father is an engineer, right?

772
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:11,997
My father-- may he rest in peace--
was also an engineer.

773
00:54:12,777 --> 00:54:16,603
I've been into stereos
since I was very young.

774
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,952
Most people don't care...

775
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:25,459
but for me it's very important.

776
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:39,266
They say in Latin:

777
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:42,961
In vino veritas.
Wine brings out the truth.

778
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:48,652
Use this to write down...

779
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:54,202
the addresses of those bastards who killed my captains.

780
00:54:55,993 --> 00:55:00,148
And not where they were last week, but where they are now.

781
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:03,293
Where they are this minute.

782
00:55:03,585 --> 00:55:07,921
And better yet, where they are going to be tomorrow.

783
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:15,847
You know where they are going to be tomorrow, right?

784
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:02,361
Reported by the government news agency, Notimex (NTX):

785
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:09,410
'Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army, acting on an anonymmous tip...

786
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:16,877
joined with police to arrest members of the ObregÛn brothers drug cartel.

787
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:21,025
Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.

788
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:24,362
Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...

789
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:30,059
that the sweep was a crippling blow to the ObregÛn brothers...

790
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:35,732
who reportedly dominate the narcotics trade...

791
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:42,114
in the city of Tijuana and the rest of Baja California state.

792
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:49,956
General Salazar wen t on to say that the au thorities were working overtime...

793
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:58,049
to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal, head of the rival Ju·rez cartel...

794
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:03,764
died last week during a plastic surgery procedure.'

795
00:57:06,058 --> 00:57:08,058
Here it is, here it is.

796
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:12,607
Get out, asshole.

797
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:15,908
Are you going to kill me?
- No.

798
00:57:16,236 --> 00:57:19,382
No, the ObregÛns will do that for us.

799
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:43,009
The port of San Ysidro, California:

800
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:47,700
45,000 vehicles on average, 25,000 pedestrians per day.

801
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,760
In the last six months, a threefold increase?

802
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,390
Increase in narcotics seizures.

803
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:00,228
Would that mean, pro rata, three times as much drugs is getting in?

804
00:58:00,328 --> 00:58:03,490
That's a scary way to figure it, but I believe that's true.

805
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,944
In my heart, I'd love to say that we were getting 60 or 70%.

806
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:11,824
In the reality, we're more like 40 or
50% of the total that's approaching us.

807
00:58:11,924 --> 00:58:14,169
And it's all big-dollar issues now.

808
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,172
That's the reason you're seeing a lot of these murders taking place.

809
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:18,582
It's one organization fighting another organization.

810
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:20,626
When things are good, people don't kill each other.

811
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:22,796
When things are bad, when they're losing dope,

812
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:24,798
when they're losing drivers and guys are going to jail,

813
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:27,618
people start killing each other.

814
00:58:35,618 --> 00:58:39,456
How's David?
- 'How's David?'

815
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:43,194
Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena--

816
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:45,580
He watched his father being dragged away by federal agents.

817
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,675
He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

818
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,420
I can't even begin to tell him where you are...

819
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,090
and when you're coming home, if you're ever coming home.

820
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,269
Helena... we're gonna get through this.

821
00:58:58,395 --> 00:59:00,395
I promise.

822
00:59:00,473 --> 00:59:01,693
I'll make it up to you.

823
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,151
- Do you have any idea...

824
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:04,844
what's going on out here?

825
00:59:04,944 --> 00:59:08,030
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

826
00:59:08,155 --> 00:59:09,889
The people in the bank-- you

827
00:59:09,915 --> 00:59:11,648
should see the way they...

828
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:13,395
look at me when I walk in.

829
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,614
I have a letter from the government telling me...

830
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:19,661
anything I sell from the house will be taken against an income tax lien.

831
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:22,880
Our fucking friends--

832
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:24,555
Nobody will help us.

833
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:26,518
Nobody will take us in.

834
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:29,588
Nobody wants anything to do with us, Carl.

835
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:34,127
So, you just tell me how you're gonna make it up to me.

836
00:59:34,227 --> 00:59:36,855
Helena--

837
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,975
Just tell me what to do.

838
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:43,179
I'm not bringing a child into the life that I was brought up into.

839
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,573
I won't do it, Carl.

840
00:59:45,698 --> 00:59:48,702
I want our life back.

841
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,480

861
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:44,442
Yeah, we're smarter.

862
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:45,525
We know the difference.

863
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,312
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

864
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,534
Hi, folks.
- Hello.

865
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:52,173
Hi. Room 310, please.

866
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:56,472
Okay, I need to see some I.D. s, please, and $28.

867
01:00:56,572 --> 01:00:58,572
Okay.

868
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:00,951
Man, I love this place.

869
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,306
I wish we could just stay here.

870
01:01:28,406 --> 01:01:32,311
Just be here forever and ever and...

871
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:35,031
make a little home here.

872
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,914
I want to, uh...

873
01:01:50,014 --> 01:01:55,370
I want to have sex and then do a hit right as we're both coming.

874
01:02:01,227 --> 01:02:03,227
Okay.

875
01:02:38,353 --> 01:02:42,341
The first time I got laid was on a beach just like that.

876
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:44,482
You got a what on a beach?

877
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:45,920
- Got laid, man.

878
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,711
Lost my virginity, was a sophomore in high school.

879
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:51,616
That's cool. - Yeah, it was sweet.

880
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:54,411
Did he treat you good?

881
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:12,259
Who's this guy?
- I don't know.

882
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,327
I never seen him before.

883
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:17,060
- He's going right for the kid.

884
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:21,108
David.

885
01:03:23,028 --> 01:03:25,490
David, come back here.

886
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:29,570
Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

887
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,031
Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers.

888
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:36,027
Karen, if he tries to move with that kid, you break cover.

889
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:39,157
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a lot of money. Snapping this...

890
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:40,616
kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

891
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,627
You better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is gonna disappear,

892
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:46,414
and he won't turn up until the evening news.

893
01:03:46,514 --> 01:03:48,562
You get only one warning.

894
01:03:48,588 --> 01:03:51,044
First payment is $3 million.

895
01:04:14,713 --> 01:04:18,759
Javier.
- Yes?

896
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:22,970
What's up, Ana?

897
01:04:24,516 --> 01:04:27,477
Manolo never came home last night.

898
01:04:28,103 --> 01:04:30,481
Come in, come in. Sit down.

899
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:38,240
I don't know where he is.

900
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:40,901
He wasn't with you last night?

901
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:43,001
No.

902
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:48,034
I'm worried.

903
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,617
Don't worry too much.

904
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:51,055
It makes you ugly.

905
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,828
Do you want a coffee?

906
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,470
Coffee with sugar?

907
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:56,536
No.
- No?

908
01:04:57,804 --> 01:05:00,140
Look, Javier.

909
01:05:01,474 --> 01:05:05,300
I was going through his clothes the other day.

910
01:05:05,813 --> 01:05:08,023
Look what I found.

911
01:05:11,402 --> 01:05:13,403
What is it?

912
01:05:20,037 --> 01:05:21,673
What were you doing?

913
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:24,397
- I was with friends from work.

914
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:28,464
Was Salazar there?

915
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:32,126
No.

916
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:34,871
The general is going to Mexico City next week...

917
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:38,116
and I'm not going to get left behind.

918
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,029
Javier Rodriguez.

919
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:07,366
The word is you're not that happy in your work.

920
01:06:07,466 --> 01:06:10,220
Maybe we can help.

921
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:29,504
John, how are you?

922
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,814
Bob Wakefield, pleasure.

923
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:31,686
Judge, welcome.

924
01:06:31,786 --> 01:06:33,015
Good to see you. How are you?

925
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:33,972
- Long time, no see.

926
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:36,666
EPIC is very unique.

927
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:40,621
It's a facility that has over 15 different agencies--state and local--...

928
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:43,124
that participate in gathering intelligence...

929
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:45,543
and making sure that information gets out...

930
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:49,631
to people in the field that need it to stop drug trafficking.

931
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:54,554
From here, we have the ability to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

932
01:06:54,654 --> 01:06:56,756
anything that carries drugs.

933
01:06:56,856 --> 01:06:59,064
When the information comes in, we're able to check...

934
01:06:59,164 --> 01:07:00,260
with different databases...

935
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,262
to see if it's in the system or not.

936
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:05,057
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

937
01:07:05,157 --> 01:07:06,849
The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--

938
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,666
Are those the two that would be...

939
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:09,562
most important?

940
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:12,273
Those are the two clearest threats right now.

941
01:07:12,373 --> 01:07:15,035
They are the dominant force in trafficking,

942
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:17,163
both on the Mexican side and in the U.S.

943
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:20,374
How are the cartels achieving...

944
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:23,703
the level of intelligence and sophistication that they're showing?

945
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:25,513
Craig, why don't you answer that?

946
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:26,782
- An unlimited budget.

947
01:07:26,857 --> 01:07:29,418
So, you're saying, actually, that even a country of our size...

948
01:07:29,518 --> 01:07:33,297
and the budget that we throw towards this issue,

949
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,100
they can compete at the same level?

950
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:36,585
- No, they're way beyond us.

951
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,705
'Way beyond'?
- Our budgetary process...

952
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,185
makes us pale in comparison.

953
01:07:43,033 --> 01:07:47,363
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

954
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,791
His nickname was Scorpion.

955
01:07:49,957 --> 01:07:51,986
I'll let you figure out what that means.

956
01:07:52,086 --> 01:07:54,580
Wasn't that the guy who died during plastic surgery?

957
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,999
Best of our information, yes.

958
01:07:57,099 --> 01:07:59,536
Who do you interact with on that side?

959
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:01,963
Nobody.

960
01:08:02,063 --> 01:08:04,698
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

961
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,446
Your position doesn't exist over there yet.

962
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:18,440
I want everyone thinking out of the box...

963
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,527
for the next few minutes.

964
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:23,262
What are we doing about Mexico?

965
01:08:23,356 --> 01:08:25,299
Come on, guys, out of the box.

966
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:26,621
- Unlimited funds?

967
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:28,794
Unlimited.

968
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:32,748
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need a vetted task force and matching funds.

969
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:36,536
And cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training.

970
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:38,580
Come on, guys, I want to hear from everyone:

971
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,434
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

972
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,722
Is there anybody from treatment on this plane?

973
01:08:44,822 --> 01:08:45,171
No, Judge.

974
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:48,342
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

975
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:50,442
Yes, sir.

976
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:54,556
We need to take down one of these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--...

977
01:08:54,656 --> 01:08:56,726
not because they're a symbol, but--

978
01:08:56,826 --> 01:08:58,681
Hell, they are a symbol.

979
01:08:58,707 --> 01:09:01,798
But because we need to send a message.

980
01:09:01,873 --> 01:09:05,569
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler as his legal defense.

981
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:08,706
I send Ben Williams down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

982
01:09:08,806 --> 01:09:11,710
Why? Because it's a symbol.

983
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,005
It's a symbol that we are sending the best.

984
01:09:15,105 --> 01:09:19,635
It's a message that we're going after their top guys.

985
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:22,263
So...

986
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:24,391
right now...

987
01:09:24,491 --> 01:09:28,069
on this flight only...

988
01:09:28,195 --> 01:09:30,606
the dam is open...

989
01:09:30,706 --> 01:09:33,910
for new ideas.

990
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:46,783
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

991
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,453
I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

992
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,467
I learned that back in Miami in '85.

993
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,627
U.S. shut down the entire Caribbean.

994
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:58,369
It's a big game of whack-a-mole.

995
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:59,934
You knock it down in Miami--

996
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:01,049
Arnie, I need money.

997
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:04,436
Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--
threatened David.

998
01:10:04,536 --> 01:10:07,816
They want a first payment of $3 million.

999
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:11,119
Oh, Helena.

1000
01:10:11,244 --> 01:10:14,615
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

1001
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,617
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

1002
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:21,280
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's gonna pay.

1003
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,209
Carl's got too much heat on him.

1004
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:28,496
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

1005
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,488
Don't we own a construction--

1006
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:32,535
- Laundromats wash the money.

1007
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,804
Just tell me something positive, Arnie.

1008
01:10:34,904 --> 01:10:37,641
Give me some good news, for Christ's sake.

1009
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:39,741
I'm sorry.

1010
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,652
I just keep wondering what's gonna happen if he doesn't get out.

1011
01:10:47,752 --> 01:10:51,248
Just never been on my own before.

1012
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:55,002
Always had someone. Always.

1013
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:07,516
I remember the first time that I saw you--...

1014
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:12,564
little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.

1015
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:18,479
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

1016
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:22,192
Glad you think so, Arnie.

1017
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:26,980
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden, 30-year-old mother of two...

1018
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:31,415
whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

1019
01:11:33,128 --> 01:11:38,059
I don't know anyone who wants to be with someone like that.

1020
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:40,745
Do you?

1021
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:42,846
Do you?

1022
01:12:15,385 --> 01:12:18,013
You two don't like me, do you?

1023
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:22,718
Miss, with all due respect, we don't have an opinion.

1024
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,963
Maybe it's because I'm going to have...

1025
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:29,217
the nicest home you've ever seen in your miserable lives.

1026
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:31,888
The old man actually kept his promise.

1027
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:36,284
The general is a man of his word.

1028
01:12:37,869 --> 01:12:41,190
They will say anything to get what they want...

1029
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:46,455
and then it's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

1030
01:12:46,555 --> 01:12:49,757
Occupational hazard, I guess.

1031
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,954
The bags?

1032
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:23,505
My love, it's beautiful. How beautiful.

1033
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:26,049
How are you feeling? Good?

1034
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:29,762
How handsome you are.

1035
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:41,049
Listen...

1036
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:43,528
the Scorpion is alive.

1037
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,780
Get in.

1038
01:13:51,453 --> 01:13:54,915
Porfirio Madrigal isn't dead after all.

1039
01:13:55,666 --> 01:14:00,427
That means that Salazar is working for the Ju·rez cartel.

1040
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:04,410
I can't believe this doesn't matter to you.

1041
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:07,088
This is nothing new, Manolo.

1042
01:14:07,188 --> 01:14:10,675
That's why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana.

1043
01:14:10,775 --> 01:14:14,686
And he has plans for Juan ObregÛn, the bastard.

1044
01:14:14,762 --> 01:14:16,762
That's right.

1045
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,938
You know how much money he would pay for this information?

1046
01:14:22,038 --> 01:14:25,438
How much?
- A fuckload of money, partner.

1047
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:31,394
What's up, man?

1048
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,277
- Take off your glasses.

1049
01:14:34,377 --> 01:14:38,117
Take off your glasses so I can see your eyes.

1050
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:50,604
We're going to keep our mouths shut.

1051
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,610
Okay.

1052
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:06,155
I think we may have found our Mexican drug czar.

1053
01:15:06,255 --> 01:15:09,158
General Salazar.

1054
01:15:09,258 --> 01:15:12,987
Be nice to have somebody to workwith down there.

1055
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:16,324
Does this mean you're gonna be gone more?

1056
01:15:16,424 --> 01:15:18,677
Possibly, yeah.

1057
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:24,835
You might want to pencil in a little face time with your daughter.

1058
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:26,442
Barbara--
- Because I'm at the edge...

1059
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:27,671
of my capabilities, Robert.

1060
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,933
I think it's important we maintain a unified front.

1061
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:33,186
If you start in on the war metaphors.

1062
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:35,388
I'm gonna drive this car into a telephone pole.

1063
01:15:35,488 --> 01:15:37,342
I am as worried as you are.

1064
01:15:37,368 --> 01:15:39,084
- Oh, I don't think so.

1065
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:39,964
'Leave me alone.

1066
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,095
Give me some money.'

1067
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,489
That's what I get from our daughter.

1068
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:47,160
She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.

1069
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:53,721
Well, she has a way of self-medicating that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

1070
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:56,579
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches...

1071
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:58,589
just to walk in the house and say hello.

1072
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:01,918
I have one drink before dinner to take the edge off. It's different.

1073
01:16:02,018 --> 01:16:06,353
Oh, is it?
- Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

1074
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:28,059
Why don't you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are?

1075
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:26,489
Caroline, open this door immediately.

1076
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:29,777
Who is it?
I'm going to the bathroom.

1077
01:17:29,877 --> 01:17:32,852
Open the goddamn door.
- One minute.

1078
01:17:39,295 --> 01:17:41,846
Excuse me.
I have to go to bed.

1079
01:17:44,718 --> 01:17:47,263
Oh, Jesus.

1080
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,721
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

1081
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:58,025
You stay right there.

1082
01:18:03,782 --> 01:18:05,782
Where are they?

1083
01:18:06,994 --> 01:18:08,904
Where the hell are the drugs?

1084
01:18:09,004 --> 01:18:11,040
Where are they?

1085
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:13,165
Fuck you.

1086
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:15,251
Fuck you.

1087
01:18:15,306 --> 01:18:17,265
I wasn't doing anything.

1088
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,412
You're like the Gestapo.

1089
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:23,971
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you.

1090
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:14,558
Javier, good to see you.

1091
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,789
- How you doing, partner?

1092
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:18,976
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

1093
01:19:19,076 --> 01:19:21,311
Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

1094
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:23,323
You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

1095
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:24,224
Of course not.

1096
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,850
- Where are you taking me?

1097
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:28,828
Somewhere safe.
- Where?

1098
01:19:28,928 --> 01:19:30,740
A place we have that we know is protected.

1099
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,649
He's good. Let's go.

1100
01:19:31,724 --> 01:19:32,511
No, no. No, no, no.

1101
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:33,943
- Don't worry. It's really safe.

1102
01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:35,098
No, no, no, no, no.

1103
01:19:35,124 --> 01:19:36,772
This is safe. This is safe.

1104
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:38,090
Come on, Javier, close the door.

1105
01:19:38,116 --> 01:19:39,357
Everything is cool, all right?

1106
01:19:39,432 --> 01:19:42,143
This is safe.
- Come on.

1107
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,681
Allright.

1108
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:47,308
Where would you like to go?

1109
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,736
Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

1110
01:19:59,747 --> 01:20:04,419
I believe it's
important that we work together.

1111
01:20:04,544 --> 01:20:06,372
Mexico and the United States.

1112
01:20:06,398 --> 01:20:08,224
One hand washing the other.

1113
01:20:08,299 --> 01:20:11,168
We agree.

1114
01:20:11,268 --> 01:20:16,794
So, maybe you can tell me about your informants in our operations.

1115
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:21,881
We thought that maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.

1116
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:26,060
This is a very different proposition, my friend.

1117
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,239
We pay for that kind of information.

1118
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:32,934
Is that what you're talking about, Javier?

1119
01:20:33,016 --> 01:20:35,079
Getting paid?

1120
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,499
You like baseball?

1121
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:48,762
We need lights for the parks so kids can play at night.

1122
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:52,424
So it's safe.

1123
01:20:52,524 --> 01:20:55,552
So they can play baseball.

1124
01:20:55,653 --> 01:20:58,640
So they no become--

1125
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,642
Everybody like baseball.

1126
01:21:00,742 --> 01:21:03,687
Everybody likes parks.

1127
01:21:03,787 --> 01:21:07,199
Listen.

1128
01:21:07,324 --> 01:21:11,279
I believe it's important that the United State take an interest...

1129
01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:13,456
in Tijuana now.

1130
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:19,046
That's what I'm talking about, my friends.

1131
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:21,590
Accountnumber...

1132
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:26,805
8201-4302-8091...

1133
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:29,140
2431.

1134
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,979
A cash advance.

1135
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:41,530
How much can I get?

1136
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:45,949
That's it?

1137
01:21:49,873 --> 01:21:51,992
You ever try the patch, man?

1138
01:21:52,092 --> 01:21:54,093
The what?
- The patch.

1139
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:56,001
That shit doesn't work, bro.

1140
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:57,857
- It worked for my cousin.

1141
01:21:57,932 --> 01:22:00,815
No shit?
- Yeah.

1142
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:03,497
He had to wear five or six at a time, but it worked.

1143
01:22:03,597 --> 01:22:05,457
So, how's he doing now?

1144
01:22:05,483 --> 01:22:06,937
- Oh, he's dead.

1145
01:22:07,475 --> 01:22:10,597
He's dead?
- It wasn't from the patch, man.

1146
01:22:10,697 --> 01:22:13,332
Okay, she's coming out.
- On it.

1147
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:14,863
What did he die from?

1148
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,378
- His wife shot him.

1149
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:20,073
She's leaving her property.

1150
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:22,185
Where the hell is she going?

1151
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:24,285
Maybe her neighbors.

1152
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:26,819
No, I don't think the neighbors are fucking with her too much...

1153
01:22:26,919 --> 01:22:27,565
right about now.

1154
01:22:27,665 --> 01:22:30,811
What does she have in her hand there?

1155
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:36,217
She seems to be headed for the van.

1156
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,640
Oh, shit.

1157
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:45,372
What-- Wh-What do we do?

1158
01:22:45,398 --> 01:22:47,738
- I-l don't know. What do we do?

1159
01:22:47,813 --> 01:22:48,854
What do you think she wants, man?

1160
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,699
- She's your girlfriend.

1161
01:22:49,774 --> 01:22:51,769
You think she'll invite you to her baby shower?

1162
01:22:51,869 --> 01:22:52,630
Just say hello. Work it.

1163
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:53,796
- All right, all right, all right.

1164
01:22:53,871 --> 01:22:56,098
She's waiting outside the van.

1165
01:22:56,198 --> 01:22:58,768
Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

1166
01:22:58,868 --> 01:23:00,745
I was just making some.

1167
01:23:00,771 --> 01:23:02,973
- You want some lemonade?

1168
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:05,046
Sure.

1169
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,280
I knowt his is a difficult situation, and you're only doing your jobs.

1170
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:12,793
I don't wish you guys any ill will or anything like that.

1171
01:23:12,893 --> 01:23:15,036
But I have a favor to ask you.

1172
01:23:15,136 --> 01:23:17,289
You're asking us for a favor?

1173
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:19,624
Some man threatened my child.

1174
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:21,636
These charges have created so much attention,

1175
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:25,798
it seems to be bringing all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.

1176
01:23:25,898 --> 01:23:29,887
Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary?

1177
01:23:29,987 --> 01:23:32,314
Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

1178
01:23:32,414 --> 01:23:34,976
I'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

1179
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,687
Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

1180
01:23:37,787 --> 01:23:40,164
You're welcome.

1181
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:50,496
I'm gonna get this analyzed right away, bro.

1182
01:23:53,013 --> 01:23:56,009
So, it was my birthday...

1183
01:23:56,109 --> 01:23:58,970
and my ex-wife was getting remarried...

1184
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,015
and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers...

1185
01:24:02,115 --> 01:24:04,092
it was a good day because...

1186
01:24:04,192 --> 01:24:07,507
I didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

1187
01:24:07,946 --> 01:24:10,859
That was enough to send me out on a pretty big one.

1188
01:24:10,959 --> 01:24:14,362
I've been thinking a lot about the first step--...

1189
01:24:14,462 --> 01:24:18,192
that I came to believe I was powerless over alcohol...

1190
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:20,361
and that my life had become unmanageable.

1191
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:23,873
My disease tells me that I don't have a disease,

1192
01:24:23,973 --> 01:24:26,535
that it's my birthday and I can have one little beer,

1193
01:24:26,635 --> 01:24:30,305
one little line, a little Valium.

1194
01:24:30,472 --> 01:24:35,086
Six months later, I wake up in a sober-living house in Philly.

1195
01:24:35,186 --> 01:24:37,688
I'm from Dallas, people.

1196
01:24:37,813 --> 01:24:41,360
It's a disease,
an allergy of the body,

1197
01:24:41,485 --> 01:24:43,917
an obsession of the mind.

1198
01:24:44,017 --> 01:24:46,199
So, my name is Marty,

1199
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:50,370
and today I'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

1200
01:24:50,495 --> 01:24:55,568
And it's a good day because I didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

1201
01:24:55,668 --> 01:24:57,668
Thanks.

1202
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,217
Hi.

1203
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:08,224
I'm Caroline.
I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.

1204
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:12,895
I mean...
I don't really like to drink.

1205
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:21,150
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

1206
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:27,787
I guess I'm angry.

1207
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,820
I mean, I think I'm really angry about a lot of stuff.

1208
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,842
I'm just... not sure what.

1209
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:26,885
Listen to me.

1210
01:26:26,911 --> 01:26:28,374
I built our house...

1211
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:30,659
and I'm not gonna lose it.

1212
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,571
My business--...

1213
01:26:35,647 --> 01:26:40,870
that would take a lot of private study.

1214
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:50,666
I suggest...
you look into the Coronel.

1215
01:26:50,766 --> 01:26:55,512
The painting?
- Into selling it.

1216
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:57,765
If you can stomach it,

1217
01:26:57,932 --> 01:27:01,560
you should look into it.

1218
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:49,238
Oh, my God.

1219
01:28:45,805 --> 01:28:48,758
Dear Judge.

1220
01:28:48,858 --> 01:28:52,805
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force.

1221
01:28:52,905 --> 01:28:58,185
I make the selection, putting them under a rigorous screening process.

1222
01:28:58,286 --> 01:29:02,816
And not only physically, but also psychologically.

1223
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:06,988
Judge, I'm sorry for boxes and the paintings and things,

1224
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:11,275
but I have been too busy to completely settle in here.

1225
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:14,070
I know you've made very good progress with the Tijuana cartel.

1226
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:16,364
Congratulations, General.
- Muchas gracias.

1227
01:29:16,464 --> 01:29:20,670
I am confident that before the end of the year.

1228
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:24,048
Juan Obregon is gonna be taken into custody.

1229
01:29:24,148 --> 01:29:28,921
But you must understand that it's going to be a very difficult task...

1230
01:29:29,021 --> 01:29:32,674
because of the corruption in the police force.

1231
01:29:32,774 --> 01:29:36,104
Hopefully, the exchange of training methods and information...

1232
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,473
between our two countries will help.

1233
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:40,734
I hope so.

1234
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:44,676
On another note, General, we were talking about supply.

1235
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:47,575
Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

1236
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:50,654
What are your policies towards treatment of addiction?

1237
01:29:50,754 --> 01:29:53,915
'Treatment of addiction.'

1238
01:29:54,015 --> 01:29:56,260
Addicts treat themselves.

1239
01:29:56,385 --> 01:30:01,060
They overdose, and then there's one less to worry about.

1240
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:10,894
What I want you to do right now is write down five triggers...

1241
01:30:10,994 --> 01:30:13,137
that could lead to your relapse,

1242
01:30:13,237 --> 01:30:15,649
that could jeopardize your recovery.

1243
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:20,655
Five triggers.
Your parents, something they could say.

1244
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:22,186
Anything that's a trigger for you.

1245
01:30:22,212 --> 01:30:23,641
It varies from person to person.

1246
01:30:23,716 --> 01:30:28,121
Some of us have already discussed--

1247
01:30:28,221 --> 01:30:30,323
Linda, we talked about it the other day.

1248
01:30:30,423 --> 01:30:32,335
I know you have trouble with your sister,

1249
01:30:32,435 --> 01:30:36,263
how she's always kind of outshining you.

1250
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:48,849
Hey, sugarfoot, how do you like your new home?

1251
01:30:50,905 --> 01:30:52,416
You got to be kidding me.

1252
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:54,919
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

1253
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:56,937
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

1254
01:30:57,037 --> 01:30:59,732
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or--...

1255
01:30:59,832 --> 01:31:01,459
Biscotti.
- Yeah, you ain't getting...

1256
01:31:01,559 --> 01:31:02,736
none of that shit either.

1257
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:04,905
Pick a bed.
- Stay off the phone, Eddie.

1258
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:06,957
No long-distance calls, all right?

1259
01:31:07,057 --> 01:31:10,136
Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.

1260
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:21,348
Mr. Ayala first came to see me in January.

1261
01:31:21,448 --> 01:31:24,569
That would have been 1987.

1262
01:31:24,694 --> 01:31:28,023
He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor.

1263
01:31:28,123 --> 01:31:32,311
I didn't ask too many questions. I am a businessman also.

1264
01:31:32,411 --> 01:31:36,916
I was the company's secretary from 1991 to 1994.

1265
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:41,279
I supposedly worked for all six companies, but they weren't--

1266
01:31:41,379 --> 01:31:45,618
I mean, it was just an empty office with a desk and a telephone.

1267
01:31:45,718 --> 01:31:48,663
I never sold anything the whole time I was there.

1268
01:31:48,763 --> 01:31:52,051
Sometimes people came in, and they got paid.

1269
01:31:52,151 --> 01:31:54,962
I-I don't really know what they did.

1270
01:31:55,062 --> 01:31:59,466
Didn't Mr. Ayala say where the money came from?

1271
01:31:59,566 --> 01:31:59,809
No.

1272
01:31:59,909 --> 01:32:04,947
Did you ask where the money came from?
- No.

1273
01:32:05,073 --> 01:32:07,142
Where do you think it came from?

1274
01:32:07,242 --> 01:32:09,612
Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

1275
01:32:09,712 --> 01:32:12,122
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

1276
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:17,433
Did you feel like you were engaged in a legitimate enterprise?

1277
01:32:18,964 --> 01:32:22,009
No, not really.

1278
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,720
Thank you.

1279
01:32:53,503 --> 01:32:56,224
You were followed by the police,

1280
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:01,137
but they won't be able to hear us over the children.

1281
01:33:03,223 --> 01:33:06,685
I want to use a bomb.

1282
01:33:10,022 --> 01:33:12,066
Are you kidding?

1283
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:15,421
Can't you just shoot him or something?

1284
01:33:16,487 --> 01:33:18,699
I don't really like guns.

1285
01:33:18,824 --> 01:33:21,227
You shoot somebody in the head two, three times...

1286
01:33:21,327 --> 01:33:26,041
and some pinche doctor is trying to keep him alive.

1287
01:33:28,043 --> 01:33:31,046
When are you gonna do it?

1288
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:33,172
I don't know.

1289
01:33:35,718 --> 01:33:40,341
Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.

1290
01:33:40,441 --> 01:33:42,821
Security will be very tight.

1291
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:47,323
I may not be able to get to him.

1292
01:33:47,349 --> 01:33:50,067
- You'll be able to get to him.

1293
01:33:50,136 --> 01:33:53,508
If they can get to
the pope and the president.

1294
01:33:53,609 --> 01:33:55,766
you can certainly get to him.

1295
01:33:55,866 --> 01:34:01,222
Careful. You're starting to sound like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

1296
01:34:21,603 --> 01:34:24,941
Nobody saw her leave?

1297
01:34:25,066 --> 01:34:27,485
Hmm.

1298
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,947
No, I understand.

1299
01:34:30,114 --> 01:34:32,616
Okay.

1300
01:34:35,661 --> 01:34:38,164
I gotta go.

1301
01:34:38,289 --> 01:34:41,159
I've got to go home.

1302
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,171
Did you want me to resch--

1303
01:34:44,296 --> 01:34:46,799
Fine.

1304
01:35:00,148 --> 01:35:01,757
What's going on?

1305
01:35:01,783 --> 01:35:03,593
You seem nervous.

1306
01:35:03,693 --> 01:35:05,896
Because of Manolo.

1307
01:35:05,996 --> 01:35:09,358
I'm afraid he'll do something foolish and it's going to get him killed.

1308
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,901
Why?

1309
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:13,947
He says he's going to sell information to the DEA.

1310
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:17,447
They're going to pay him a lot of money.

1311
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:22,506
What could he tell the DEA?

1312
01:35:22,965 --> 01:35:24,584
You know...

1313
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:26,979
about Salazar and Madrigal.

1314
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:38,022
Javier.

1315
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,530
Where is he right now?

1316
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:45,742
I don't know.

1317
01:35:45,768 --> 01:35:48,644
He took his passport and left.

1318
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:55,410
Give me a kiss.

1319
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:56,612
Don't tell him that I told you.

1320
01:35:56,712 --> 01:35:58,712
No.

1321
01:36:28,373 --> 01:36:30,413
What you want? Pot? Rock?

1322
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:32,153
Hey, what you want?

1323
01:37:20,807 --> 01:37:24,020
Fuck.

1324
01:37:40,497 --> 01:37:43,041
What the fuck do you want?

1325
01:38:11,865 --> 01:38:13,866
Yeah.

1326
01:40:28,563 --> 01:40:32,092
It has come to our attention that Your Honor, while in private practice,

1327
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:34,470
previously represented the town of Seal Beach...

1328
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:37,474
in their stop-work suit against the police department of Seal Beach.

1329
01:40:37,574 --> 01:40:40,101
We believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case,

1330
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:44,190
and we, therefore, move for a temporary suspension until it's investigated.

1331
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:46,442
Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual motion.

1332
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:48,453
Nonetheless, Your Honor,

1333
01:40:48,553 --> 01:40:51,782
we feel our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law.

1334
01:40:51,882 --> 01:40:58,342
I hope this is not in anyway designed to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

1335
01:41:01,559 --> 01:41:04,262
We will recess until 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning,

1336
01:41:04,362 --> 01:41:08,400
and I will see counsel in my chambers.

1337
01:41:25,086 --> 01:41:27,506
They are coming this way.

1338
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:33,595
All of them are there.

1339
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,432
They are passing me now.

1340
01:41:42,314 --> 01:41:45,267
Boy, there's a lot of them.

1341
01:41:45,367 --> 01:41:50,190
Listen, would you mind if we walked back to the hotel today?

1342
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:53,034
Walk back?
- Yeah.

1343
01:41:56,997 --> 01:41:59,802
They're not getting into the car.

1344
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:02,995
What are they doing?

1345
01:42:03,095 --> 01:42:05,561
They're arguing or something.

1346
01:42:08,218 --> 01:42:09,077
It's two blocks.

1347
01:42:09,103 --> 01:42:10,604
I could use the fresh air.

1348
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,124
I've been stuck in that piece of shit hotel room for two weeks.

1349
01:42:13,224 --> 01:42:14,187
I don't give a fuck.

1350
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,848
Let's just stop standing around.

1351
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,730
I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,
not 'cause he wants to walk.

1352
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:18,088
Let's walk.

1353
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:20,653
I like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

1354
01:42:23,068 --> 01:42:25,321
They're going past me.

1355
01:42:29,033 --> 01:42:30,267
I-I-I do not know.

1356
01:42:30,293 --> 01:42:33,514
I think they're going back to the courthouse.

1357
01:42:33,589 --> 01:42:36,788
This could be the last chance to do this.

1358
01:42:36,814 --> 01:42:38,488
Get out of the car...

1359
01:42:38,563 --> 01:42:40,815
and shoot him in the head.

1360
01:42:57,816 --> 01:42:59,802
You're a fucking big man?

1361
01:42:59,902 --> 01:43:01,810
I'm a real fucking man.

1362
01:43:01,836 --> 01:43:06,643
I don't fucking deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--

1363
01:43:08,871 --> 01:43:10,439
Fucking rat.

1364
01:43:10,539 --> 01:43:12,649
You think you're a badass?

1365
01:43:12,675 --> 01:43:14,134
- I am a badass.

1366
01:43:15,419 --> 01:43:19,049
Move, move. Get down.

1367
01:43:26,682 --> 01:43:27,566
Go, go, go.

1368
01:43:27,592 --> 01:43:29,438
We need an ambulance.

1369
01:43:29,513 --> 01:43:31,514
Go, go, go.

1370
01:43:58,301 --> 01:43:59,424
Ray. Ray. Ray.

1371
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,132
Wait a minute, Ray.

1372
01:44:48,358 --> 01:44:50,824
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

1373
01:44:51,112 --> 01:44:53,239
What's up, Manolo?

1374
01:44:55,241 --> 01:44:57,937
Looks like you're waiting for someone.

1375
01:44:58,037 --> 01:45:00,648
I'm just looking for the waitress.

1376
01:45:00,748 --> 01:45:01,797
I'm ready to order.

1377
01:45:01,823 --> 01:45:03,092
Do you want anything?

1378
01:45:03,167 --> 01:45:04,405
A fucking salad?

1379
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:06,054
Something to drink?

1380
01:45:06,129 --> 01:45:09,083
No, no. Calm down, calm down.

1381
01:45:09,183 --> 01:45:13,137
What are you gonna have, Manolito?

1382
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:17,935
A steak.

1383
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:22,188
Well, if you like steak...

1384
01:45:22,264 --> 01:45:24,733
we know a much better place.

1385
01:45:25,067 --> 01:45:27,487
You come with us.

1386
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:58,786
Javier had nothing to do with this.

1387
01:46:00,023 --> 01:46:02,527
It was all my idea.

1388
01:46:05,697 --> 01:46:08,116
Punish me, not him.

1389
01:46:12,872 --> 01:46:15,332
Do me a favor.

1390
01:46:18,545 --> 01:46:21,265
Don't tell Ana I died like this.

1391
01:46:23,092 --> 01:46:26,637
Tell her it was something else.

1392
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:30,642
Something official.

1393
01:46:35,856 --> 01:46:39,172
Tell her I died doing something worthy.

1394
01:46:41,696 --> 01:46:43,948
Forgive me, Javi.

1395
01:46:51,415 --> 01:46:53,835
Put some muscle into it.

1396
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,963
You too, Manolo.

1397
01:47:04,472 --> 01:47:06,801
You're done.

1398
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:07,799
Get out of there.

1399
01:47:07,825 --> 01:47:08,828
- Don't you hear?

1400
01:47:08,903 --> 01:47:12,231
Javier, put the shovel down.

1401
01:47:13,817 --> 01:47:16,486
Get out. Let's go.

1402
01:47:17,987 --> 01:47:20,623
I told you it wasn't his fault.

1403
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:22,699
Shut up.

1404
01:47:26,831 --> 01:47:29,000
Turn around.

1405
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,940
Let's go, Javier. It's over.

1406
01:48:03,372 --> 01:48:06,626
Don't be alarmed, Javier.

1407
01:48:06,793 --> 01:48:09,173
The old man works like this.

1408
01:48:09,258 --> 01:48:12,319
We had to go through the same thing.

1409
01:48:14,051 --> 01:48:17,872
We had to do this to be sure we could trust you.

1410
01:48:17,972 --> 01:48:19,975
Now we see that we can.

1411
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,853
We are family now.

1412
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:27,971
Sorry about the other night.

1413
01:49:29,887 --> 01:49:31,888
Me too.

1414
01:51:39,995 --> 01:51:45,776
Thank you for coming down here, though I
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

1415
01:51:45,876 --> 01:51:47,368
Why would you say that?

1416
01:51:47,394 --> 01:51:49,856
- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.

1417
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:53,251
Your husband in jail, his business in chaos,

1418
01:51:53,351 --> 01:51:56,538
various people fighting over the scraps.

1419
01:51:56,638 --> 01:52:00,384
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

1420
01:52:00,484 --> 01:52:03,062
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

1421
01:52:03,229 --> 01:52:05,982
Your route has been compromised.

1422
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:09,512
Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.

1423
01:52:09,612 --> 01:52:11,764
I don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

1424
01:52:11,864 --> 01:52:14,575
No.

1425
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:19,481
My husband was working on something
he called the Project for the Children.

1426
01:52:19,581 --> 01:52:21,355
Are you aware of this?

1427
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,751
- I don't know.

1428
01:52:22,816 --> 01:52:25,421
Perhaps I remember something.

1429
01:52:28,925 --> 01:52:33,497
If you want to smuggle narcotics in Senor Espastico Jacobo,

1430
01:52:33,597 --> 01:52:35,800
that is nothing new, Senora.

1431
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:39,638
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

1432
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:43,650
High impact, pressure-molded cocaine.

1433
01:52:45,611 --> 01:52:48,639
It's odorless, undetectable by the dogs.

1434
01:52:48,739 --> 01:52:51,651
Undetectable by anyone.

1435
01:52:51,752 --> 01:52:54,132
I don't believe you, senora.

1436
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:20,901
I'm six months pregnant.

1437
01:53:21,026 --> 01:53:23,026
I won't do it.

1438
01:53:23,104 --> 01:53:26,504
Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

1439
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:28,869
We don't have a deal.

1440
01:53:30,036 --> 01:53:33,540
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregon.

1441
01:53:35,168 --> 01:53:37,168
Okay.

1442
01:53:37,246 --> 01:53:39,246
Okay, okay.

1443
01:53:48,307 --> 01:53:49,690
That's good coke.

1444
01:53:49,716 --> 01:53:52,073
- It should be. It's yours.

1445
01:53:53,605 --> 01:53:55,507
I want our debt forgiven.

1446
01:53:55,607 --> 01:53:58,522
I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon brothers'

1447
01:53:58,622 --> 01:54:00,054
cocaine in the United States,

1448
01:54:00,154 --> 01:54:06,360
and I want the principal witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

1449
01:54:11,834 --> 01:54:16,424
Have you told the complete truth during this interview?

1450
01:54:17,048 --> 01:54:19,760
Yes.

1451
01:54:20,969 --> 01:54:23,589
Alex?
- Solid.

1452
01:54:23,689 --> 01:54:25,017
That's good shit, Javier.

1453
01:54:25,043 --> 01:54:26,159
- You know, Javier,

1454
01:54:26,234 --> 01:54:28,762
they dump those cell phones every 24 hours.

1455
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:32,398
Yes, but I have a contact at MexTel...

1456
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:36,771
who can get me his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

1457
01:54:36,871 --> 01:54:38,871
That's good to know.

1458
01:54:42,911 --> 01:54:45,823
So, now that you have what you want,

1459
01:54:45,923 --> 01:54:49,239
let's talk about how I get what I want.

1460
01:54:49,318 --> 01:54:51,487
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

1461
01:54:51,587 --> 01:54:54,324
You're not gonna have any problems there.

1462
01:54:54,424 --> 01:54:57,290
Yeah, but first let's talk about what precautions you're...

1463
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,746
taking to protect yourself.

1464
01:54:58,846 --> 01:55:02,809
You worry about getting me what I want.

1465
01:55:02,976 --> 01:55:05,353
I'll worry about myself.

1466
01:55:10,025 --> 01:55:14,488
Oye, Javier, you should feel good about this.

1467
01:55:17,784 --> 01:55:20,203
I feel like a traitor.

1468
01:56:46,385 --> 01:56:50,623
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.

1469
01:56:50,723 --> 01:56:52,792
Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

1470
01:56:52,892 --> 01:56:57,306
She was clean, and she's back in San Diego now.

1471
01:56:57,406 --> 01:56:59,406
Okay.

1472
01:57:09,578 --> 01:57:13,291
Hello?
- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.

1473
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:14,802
D-Did I wake you?
I'm sorry.

1474
01:57:14,828 --> 01:57:15,718
- No, it's okay.

1475
01:57:15,793 --> 01:57:17,829
General Salazar has been arrested.

1476
01:57:17,929 --> 01:57:20,365
It turns out he has been working for Porfirio Madrigal...

1477
01:57:20,465 --> 01:57:22,534
and the Juarez cartel the entire time.

1478
01:57:22,634 --> 01:57:25,830
That is why he was trying to push the Obregons out of Tijuana...

1479
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:28,208
so he and Madrigal could move in.
- What?

1480
01:57:28,308 --> 01:57:29,620
I thought Madrigal was dead.

1481
01:57:29,646 --> 01:57:31,286
I thought that had been verified.

1482
01:57:31,361 --> 01:57:34,677
Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,

1483
01:57:34,776 --> 01:57:38,844
but the D.E.A. supplied the information and was part of the sting.

1484
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:42,357
So, maybe we can spin this a little, but I don't know what to tell people.

1485
01:57:42,457 --> 01:57:43,757
So, when are you coming back?

1486
01:57:43,783 --> 01:57:45,710
- I'll try to get there as soon as I can.

1487
01:57:45,785 --> 01:57:48,039
Yeah, okay, but--
- Robert.

1488
01:57:48,164 --> 01:57:52,535
Robert? Robert?

1489
01:57:52,635 --> 01:57:54,880
I gotta call you back.

1490
01:57:55,005 --> 01:57:57,005
What--...

1491
01:58:01,513 --> 01:58:03,357
My Leica's missing.

1492
01:58:03,383 --> 01:58:06,584
- She got the video camera too.

1493
01:58:06,684 --> 01:58:08,549
At least we know she's still alive.

1494
01:58:08,575 --> 01:58:09,747
Where are you going?

1495
01:58:09,822 --> 01:58:11,246
Pawn shops open in an hour.

1496
01:58:11,272 --> 01:58:13,909
Ten minutes after that, she'll be at her dealer.

1497
01:58:13,984 --> 01:58:17,980
If I can find him, I should be able to find her.

1498
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:31,380
Although ser and estar both mean 'to be,'

1499
01:58:31,505 --> 01:58:35,376
they have very specific uses.

1500
01:58:35,476 --> 01:58:38,429
May I help you, sir?

1501
01:58:43,268 --> 01:58:45,087
Excuse me.

1502
01:58:45,187 --> 01:58:47,067
Seth has to be excused.

1503
01:58:47,093 --> 01:58:49,462
He's going on a field trip.

1504
01:58:54,739 --> 01:58:59,245
I can't believe you brought my daughter to this place.

1505
01:59:00,204 --> 01:59:04,917
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just back the fuck up, man?

1506
01:59:05,042 --> 01:59:07,129
'To this place'?

1507
01:59:07,254 --> 01:59:09,456
What is that shit?

1508
01:59:09,556 --> 01:59:12,459
Okay, right now, all over this great nation of ours,

1509
01:59:12,559 --> 01:59:15,297
100,000 white people from the suburbs are cruising around downtown...

1510
01:59:15,397 --> 01:59:17,769
asking every black person, 'You got any drugs? You know...

1511
01:59:17,869 --> 01:59:19,167
where I can score some drugs?'

1512
01:59:19,267 --> 01:59:22,124
Think about the effect that has on the psyche of a black person.

1513
01:59:22,224 --> 01:59:23,130
on their possibilities.

1514
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:25,982
I-- God, I guarantee you, you bring 100,000 black people...

1515
01:59:26,082 --> 01:59:27,259
into your neighborhood,

1516
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:30,113
and they're asking every white person, 'You got any drugs?

1517
01:59:30,213 --> 01:59:31,681
Know where I can score some?'

1518
01:59:31,781 --> 01:59:35,978
Within a day, everyone would be selling--your friends, their kids.

1519
01:59:36,078 --> 01:59:38,542
Here's why: It's an unbeatable market force, man.

1520
01:59:38,568 --> 01:59:39,849
It's a 300% markup value.

1521
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:42,765
You can go out on the street and make $500 in two hours,

1522
01:59:42,865 --> 01:59:44,830
come back and do whatever you want with the rest of your day.

1523
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:50,881
You're telling me that white people would still be going to law school?

1544
02:00:14,330 --> 02:00:15,442
What do you want?

1545
02:00:15,468 --> 02:00:17,559
- I'm looking for my daughter.

1546
02:00:17,634 --> 02:00:19,635
Caroline.

1547
02:00:19,711 --> 02:00:22,039
She's been here.

1548
02:00:22,139 --> 02:00:22,927
This is a business, man.

1549
02:00:22,953 --> 02:00:24,266
Why don't you get the fuck out ofhere?

1550
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:28,677
I need to find my daughter, all right?
I'll pay you.

1551
02:00:29,347 --> 02:00:32,559
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

1552
02:00:35,688 --> 02:00:37,778
Who in the fuck do you think you are?

1553
02:00:37,804 --> 02:00:39,951
Where the fuck do you think you are?

1554
02:00:40,026 --> 02:00:44,144
Why the fuck shouldn't I just put your ass in a Dumpster?

1555
02:00:44,244 --> 02:00:45,098
I got money.

1556
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:45,933
I got money.

1557
02:00:45,959 --> 02:00:47,794
- I got $1,000 in my wallet.

1558
02:00:47,869 --> 02:00:48,923
It's for you.

1559
02:00:48,949 --> 02:00:51,379
- If I want your money, man.

1560
02:00:51,444 --> 02:00:53,444
I will take your money.

1561
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:56,779
Just tell me where my daughter is.

1562
02:00:56,879 --> 02:00:59,298
Please? Please?

1563
02:01:04,888 --> 02:01:07,056
Don't do that shit again.

1564
02:01:13,564 --> 02:01:18,303
Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you, don't do this vigilante thing.

1565
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:21,473
Either the cops are gonna find her, or she's gonna call you.

1566
02:01:21,573 --> 02:01:23,574
Okay?

1567
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:25,652
I promise.

1568
02:01:53,902 --> 02:01:55,902
Ana.

1569
02:01:57,364 --> 02:02:00,425
If Manolo hadn't done what he did...

1570
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:05,878
they wouldn't have been able to get Salazar and Madrigal.

1571
02:02:10,087 --> 02:02:12,673
He did something really good.

1572
02:02:15,718 --> 02:02:20,053
What's more, he did something important for Tijuana.

1573
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:23,561
I would like to believe you.

1574
02:02:31,194 --> 02:02:34,656
You don't have to believe me...

1575
02:02:36,784 --> 02:02:38,911
because it's the truth.

1576
02:02:40,162 --> 02:02:42,583
The simple truth.

1577
02:02:58,851 --> 02:03:02,166
Tomorrow I'm going to burn his clothes.

1578
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:50,880
I know she's in there.

1579
02:03:50,906 --> 02:03:52,595
Just let me talk to her.

1580
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:55,491
Look, I know she's in there, man.

1581
02:03:55,591 --> 02:03:58,481
No, I fucking know she's in there.

1582
02:04:01,923 --> 02:04:04,125
Jesus Christ.

1583
02:04:04,225 --> 02:04:06,886
I-I haven't touched her.

1584
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:16,126
You get the fuck out of here right now.

1585
02:04:28,953 --> 02:04:30,954
Hi.

1586
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:39,674
Hi, Daddy.

1587
02:04:42,844 --> 02:04:45,014
Hi, sweetheart.

1588
02:05:18,551 --> 02:05:21,722
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

1589
02:05:21,847 --> 02:05:23,891
Good morning.
- Big day.

1590
02:05:25,392 --> 02:05:29,898
You're a star.

1591
02:05:30,065 --> 02:05:33,975
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

1592
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:38,233
Who is it?
- It's the Mafia.

1593
02:05:38,333 --> 02:05:41,619
I've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

1594
02:05:45,374 --> 02:05:48,349
So who's this going to?
- Over here.

1595
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:58,013
Ooh.
- Fuck off.

1596
02:05:58,138 --> 02:06:01,843
Relax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone?

1597
02:06:01,943 --> 02:06:03,943
Good-bye.

1598
02:06:04,271 --> 02:06:06,339
You know, you're gonna be testifying for about ten days.

1599
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:08,642
We could just decide to stop feeding your ass.

1600
02:06:08,742 --> 02:06:11,379
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life...

1601
02:06:11,479 --> 02:06:12,638
looking over my shoulder?

1602
02:06:12,738 --> 02:06:16,492
Wow, that's-- that's heavy, Eddie.

1603
02:06:19,288 --> 02:06:21,701
Can't you for one second imagine that none of this had happened.

1604
02:06:21,801 --> 02:06:23,025
that my drugs had gone through?

1605
02:06:23,125 --> 02:06:25,125
What would be the harm?

1606
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:27,363
Huh? What would be the harm?

1607
02:06:27,463 --> 02:06:30,166
A few people get high who are getting high anyway.

1608
02:06:30,266 --> 02:06:33,304
Your partner's still alive.

1609
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:36,955
We don't have to have breakfast together.

1610
02:06:37,037 --> 02:06:39,010
Don't you see this means nothing?

1611
02:06:39,110 --> 02:06:41,576
Your whole life is pointless.

1612
02:06:42,647 --> 02:06:45,367
You're really breaking my heart.

1613
02:06:46,943 --> 02:06:52,533
The worst part about you, Monty--
- 'Monty'?

1614
02:06:52,658 --> 02:06:54,570
The worst part about you, Monty,

1615
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:57,990
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

1616
02:06:58,090 --> 02:07:00,901
Wish you could see how transparent you are.

1617
02:07:01,001 --> 02:07:03,154
This food tastes like shit.

1618
02:07:03,254 --> 02:07:07,589
So, take your stank ass and go get a shower already.

1619
02:07:09,011 --> 02:07:10,922
Let me tell you something.

1620
02:07:11,022 --> 02:07:13,925
You only got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

1621
02:07:14,025 --> 02:07:15,927
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

1622
02:07:16,027 --> 02:07:19,431
You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

1623
02:07:19,531 --> 02:07:23,867
So, remember, you work for a drug dealer too, Monty.

1624
02:07:23,962 --> 02:07:25,962
Fuck me.

1625
02:07:26,049 --> 02:07:28,950
Who is it?
- Breakfast.

1626
02:07:31,536 --> 02:07:33,831
Hurry up.
It's getting cold.

1627
02:07:38,169 --> 02:07:40,169
Okay. One second.

1628
02:07:41,339 --> 02:07:42,348
Get the fuck down.

1629
02:07:42,374 --> 02:07:43,942
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1630
02:07:44,017 --> 02:07:45,702
Get down. Get the fuck down.

1631
02:07:45,728 --> 02:07:47,592
- Hey, hey, I'm on your side.

1632
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:48,643
What the fuck?

1633
02:07:48,669 --> 02:07:50,900
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

1634
02:07:50,975 --> 02:07:52,568
Call an ambulance. Fuck.
- Palms up.

1635
02:07:52,668 --> 02:07:53,962
Spread your damn hands out.

1636
02:07:54,062 --> 02:07:57,107
Shit. Eddie.

1637
02:07:59,652 --> 02:08:01,729
Hold on.

1638
02:08:01,829 --> 02:08:05,059
Oh, shit.
Hurry up with that ambulance.

1639
02:08:05,159 --> 02:08:07,786
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

1640
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:14,321
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1641
02:08:14,421 --> 02:08:18,331
because of the sudden death of Eduardo Ruiz,

1642
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:23,396
the people have determined that we cannot continue our case...

1643
02:08:23,496 --> 02:08:25,080
against Carl Ayala.

1644
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:28,184
Oh. Oh.

1645
02:08:30,687 --> 02:08:32,142
Thank you so much.

1646
02:08:32,168 --> 02:08:34,027
Thank you, thank you.

1647
02:10:18,435 --> 02:10:20,887
Yeah?

1648
02:10:20,987 --> 02:10:22,987
Hi.

1649
02:10:24,108 --> 02:10:27,478
I got a copy of your speech.

1650
02:10:27,578 --> 02:10:30,281
It's fantastic.

1651
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:32,993
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

1652
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:33,993
You're my choice.

1653
02:10:34,019 --> 02:10:35,254
You're gonna be great.

1654
02:10:35,329 --> 02:10:38,149
The president's sorry he hasn't been able to spend more time with you.

1655
02:10:38,249 --> 02:10:41,828
After the press conference, he wants to really sit down.

1656
02:10:41,928 --> 02:10:46,133
Oh, and I got to the Post too.

1657
02:10:46,258 --> 02:10:48,994
Don't worry about that thing with your daughter. It's not news.

1658
02:10:49,094 --> 02:10:53,375
They're willing to treat it as a family matter, personal matter.

1659
02:10:53,475 --> 02:10:57,387
Anyway, if it came out, we could turn it into a qualification.

1660
02:10:57,487 --> 02:10:59,515
'I've been in the trenches of the drug war.

1661
02:10:59,615 --> 02:11:02,518
I've seen the face of the enemy.
Etcetera, etcetera.'

1662
02:11:02,618 --> 02:11:07,441
A sterling reputation and close friend of the president,

1663
02:11:07,541 --> 02:11:11,228
recently confirmed into the Office of National Drug Control Policy,

1664
02:11:11,328 --> 02:11:16,042
our new drug czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.

1665
02:11:26,512 --> 02:11:30,041
The war on drugs is a war that we have to win,

1666
02:11:30,141 --> 02:11:33,178
and a war that we can win.

1667
02:11:33,278 --> 02:11:39,051
We have to win this war to save our country's most precious resource--...

1668
02:11:39,151 --> 02:11:41,854
our children.

1669
02:11:41,954 --> 02:11:46,443
Sixty-eight million children have been targeted...

1670
02:11:46,543 --> 02:11:49,538
by those who perpetrate this war...

1671
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:56,004
and protecting these children must be priority number one.

1672
02:11:59,717 --> 02:12:05,223
There has been progress, and there has been failure.

1673
02:12:05,348 --> 02:12:08,719
But where we have fallen short.

1674
02:12:08,819 --> 02:12:12,231
I see not a problem.

1675
02:12:12,356 --> 02:12:16,110
I see an opportunity.

1676
02:12:19,573 --> 02:12:22,618
An opportunity...

1677
02:12:22,743 --> 02:12:28,408
to correct the mistakes...
ofthe past...

1678
02:12:28,508 --> 02:12:32,920
while laying a foundation for the future.

1679
02:12:38,552 --> 02:12:41,006
This takes...

1680
02:12:41,106 --> 02:12:44,809
not only new ideas...

1681
02:12:44,934 --> 02:12:47,847
but perseverance.

1682
02:12:47,947 --> 02:12:53,736
This takes not only...
resources, but courage.

1683
02:12:53,861 --> 02:12:55,862
This takes...

1684
02:12:55,959 --> 02:12:59,117
not only... government,

1685
02:12:59,242 --> 02:13:01,828
but families.

1686
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:05,833
I've laid out a--

1687
02:13:09,254 --> 02:13:13,217
I've laid out a ten-point plan that--

1688
02:13:28,317 --> 02:13:30,317
I can't do this.

1689
02:13:33,657 --> 02:13:37,703
If there is a war on drugs,

1690
02:13:37,828 --> 02:13:41,874
then many of our family members are the enemy.

1691
02:13:45,337 --> 02:13:50,551
And I don't know how you wage war on your own family.

1692
02:14:33,725 --> 02:14:36,437
National Airport, please.

1693
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:23,415
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.

1694
02:15:23,441 --> 02:15:25,884
You're working too hard, my friend.

1695
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,524
Carl, I'm running late.

1696
02:15:27,550 --> 02:15:29,180
I'm coming right over.

1697
02:15:29,255 --> 02:15:31,938
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.

1698
02:15:31,964 --> 02:15:34,228
Let me ask you something.

1699
02:15:34,303 --> 02:15:37,206
When were you gonna tell me about the $3 million...

1700
02:15:37,306 --> 02:15:41,786
we got in from San Francisco two days after I was arrested?

1701
02:15:41,886 --> 02:15:45,807
Um... I was waiting for the right time.

1702
02:15:45,932 --> 02:15:49,253
Oh. You didn't think you could trust my wife with that information?

1703
02:15:49,353 --> 02:15:51,478
I didn't want to risk it.

1704
02:15:51,556 --> 02:15:54,017
That could have been frozen along with everything else.

1705
02:15:54,117 --> 02:15:56,386
You had it all figured out, didn'tyou?

1706
02:15:56,486 --> 02:15:58,397
You were gonna move into my house,

1707
02:15:58,497 --> 02:16:02,076
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

1708
02:16:02,201 --> 02:16:04,370
with my wife.

1709
02:16:04,495 --> 02:16:06,748
Sounds like a nice plan.

1710
02:16:06,914 --> 02:16:08,914
Oh, is it insane?

1711
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,235
Just think about it, okay?

1712
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:11,637
If I was gonna rip you off,

1713
02:16:11,712 --> 02:16:13,914
why wouldn't I just leave town after Ruiz was killed?

1714
02:16:14,014 --> 02:16:17,169
Why would I sit next to you in court and listen to a dismissal?

1715
02:16:17,269 --> 02:16:18,377
Let me ask you something.

1716
02:16:18,403 --> 02:16:19,954
You think there's a difference...

1717
02:16:20,029 --> 02:16:21,623
between a reason and an excuse?

1718
02:16:21,723 --> 02:16:24,226
'Cause I don't.

1719
02:16:24,352 --> 02:16:27,646
Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl--

1720
02:16:27,772 --> 02:16:29,772
Carl?

1721
02:16:37,532 --> 02:16:39,744
Come on, sweetheart.

1722
02:16:39,869 --> 02:16:42,981
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1723
02:16:43,081 --> 02:16:45,451
Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh--...

1724
02:16:45,551 --> 02:16:47,787
He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1725
02:16:47,887 --> 02:16:50,422
Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1726
02:16:52,132 --> 02:16:54,044
Hello.
- It's a great party.

1727
02:16:54,144 --> 02:16:55,508
Who is he, a friend of yours?

1728
02:16:55,534 --> 02:16:56,521
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

1729
02:16:56,596 --> 02:16:59,124
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

1730
02:16:59,224 --> 02:17:01,678
You're--
- How you doing?

1731
02:17:01,778 --> 02:17:03,018
What are you doing in my house?

1732
02:17:03,044 --> 02:17:04,163
- Oh, just looking around.

1733
02:17:04,238 --> 02:17:07,685
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1734
02:17:07,785 --> 02:17:10,095
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

1735
02:17:10,195 --> 02:17:12,347
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

1736
02:17:12,447 --> 02:17:13,591
Fuck you and fuck your wife.

1737
02:17:13,617 --> 02:17:14,843
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1738
02:17:14,918 --> 02:17:18,363
Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1739
02:17:18,463 --> 02:17:20,448
I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

1740
02:17:20,548 --> 02:17:23,794
Get out.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1741
02:17:30,552 --> 02:17:32,031
Is that what you wanted?

1742
02:17:32,057 --> 02:17:34,522
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1743
02:17:34,597 --> 02:17:36,709
Tell him how you murdered my partner.

1744
02:17:36,809 --> 02:17:39,337
You got the wrong--
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena.

1745
02:17:39,437 --> 02:17:42,682
Ray Castro.
You remember that.

1746
02:17:42,782 --> 02:17:43,707
What's his problem?

1747
02:17:43,733 --> 02:17:45,044
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1748
02:17:45,119 --> 02:17:47,839
No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

1749
02:17:50,116 --> 02:17:53,516
Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

1750
02:17:59,001 --> 02:18:01,381
What do you want to do, man?

1751
02:18:30,536 --> 02:18:34,450
On the good days, I feel like I get it.

1752
02:18:34,550 --> 02:18:38,454
Like it all makes sense.

1753
02:18:38,554 --> 02:18:40,832
I can stay in the moment.

1754
02:18:40,932 --> 02:18:45,720
I don't have to control everything in the future...

1755
02:18:45,845 --> 02:18:51,602
and I believe everything is gonna work out fine.

1756
02:18:54,856 --> 02:18:56,856
O-On the bad days.

1757
02:18:58,527 --> 02:19:02,807
I just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers.

1758
02:19:02,907 --> 02:19:06,611
I want to pull my hair...

1759
02:19:06,711 --> 02:19:10,958
and run through the streets screaming.

1760
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:20,468
But thanks to the people I've met in these rooms,

1761
02:19:20,593 --> 02:19:24,807
like Margaret and Jim...

1762
02:19:24,932 --> 02:19:27,823
and Sarah,

1763
02:19:27,923 --> 02:19:30,479
um...

1764
02:19:30,604 --> 02:19:33,017
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make it...

1765
02:19:33,117 --> 02:19:35,152
through today.

1766
02:19:46,623 --> 02:19:49,168
Would you like to share?

1767
02:19:50,461 --> 02:19:54,007
Uh... my name is Robert.

1768
02:19:54,132 --> 02:19:57,044
My wife Barbara and I...

1769
02:19:57,144 --> 02:20:01,015
are here to support our daughter, Caroline,

1770
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:04,060
and we're hear to listen.
