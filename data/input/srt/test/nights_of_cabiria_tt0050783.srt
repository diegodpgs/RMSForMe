1
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,375
Go over there.

2
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,054
It's beautiful!
Come on!

3
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,612
Giorgio!

4
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,548
Help! Help!

5
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,624
Help! Somebody's drowning!

6
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,411
Where's Romolo?

7
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,379
He went to City Hall.

8
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,745
To hell with City Hall!

9
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,647
It's a woman.

10
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,148
There she is!

11
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,826
Tino's not here either?

12
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,825
Is she trying to drown herself?

13
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,396
There she is.
Go in after her.

14
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,095
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

15
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,134
A woman's drowning!

16
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,444
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

17
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,796
Pascello, run!
Come over here!

18
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,801
What are you doing? Not like that!
Turn her upside down!

19
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,666
Stefano, hurry up!

20
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,636
Where'd you fish her out?

21
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,142
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

22
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,779
She was drowning!

23
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,108
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

24
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,012
She must have slipped and fell in.

25
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,152
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

26
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,150
- Did she go under?
- Three times.

27
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,290
- At least seven times!
- Ten times!

28
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,894
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

29
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,364
What happened?

30
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,000
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

31
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,235
I think she's dead.

32
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,711
Get the water out, before it's too late.

33
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,216
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

34
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,480
We saved her!

35
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,385
Beat it!

36
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,657
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

37
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,557
Look.

38
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,857
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

39
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,035
Looks dead to me.

40
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,605
Dead bodies don't throw up water.

41
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,366
She opened her eyes!

42
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,875
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

43
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,775
We'll give her artificial respiration.

44
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,448
She's bleeding.

45
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,710
It's just a scratch.

46
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,348
What she needs is brandy.

47
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,856
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

48
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,597
Quiet! She's coming to. 
You, with the motorbike, go get some milk.

49
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,359
I'm out of gas.

50
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,537
Take it easy now.

51
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,474
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

52
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,904
You're fine.

53
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,574
Where's Giorgio?

54
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,145
What Giorgio?

55
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,418
Where are you going?

56
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,622
Who's she looking for?

57
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,258
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

58
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,670
Who does he think he is?

59
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,472
Take it easy. Come here.

60
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,941
I'm going home.
Where are my shoes?

61
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,244
Here. There's only one.

62
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,286
She's got seven souls, like a cat.

63
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,149
See? She can hardly stand up.

64
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,256
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,620
You were almost dead.

66
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,355
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

67
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,422
Hey! We're the ones who saved you!

68
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,934
You saved me.
Now I wanna go home, okay?

69
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,433
Okay, suit yourself.
Go home. Good-bye.

70
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,800
Hi, Cabiria.

71
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,441
You know her?

72
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,842
Sure. She's Cabiria.

73
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,209
Where's she live?

74
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,613
On Via Cecilia.

75
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,176
She lives the life.

76
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,482
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

77
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,712
It's me! Cabiria!

78
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,230
Wanda!

79
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,943
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

80
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,241
What happened to you?

81
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,941
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

82
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,416
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

83
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,647
What happened to you?

84
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,963
What do you want from me?

85
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,922
What do you want?

86
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,499
I don't want nothing.
Mind your own fat ass!

87
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,556
Go inside and dry yourself off.

88
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,520
I don't have the keys.

89
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,154
Where'd you put them?

90
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,692
In my purse.

91
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,988
Where's your purse?

92
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,568
Giorgio's got it.

93
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,235
We took a walk by the river and...

94
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,569
I fell in.

95
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,109
He got scared and ran away.

96
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,907
Cabiria! Open up!

97
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,047
Come on, open up.

98
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,586
I gotta sleep!

99
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,787
Tell me something.

100
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,893
How much did you have in your purse? 
Answer me.

101
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,247
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

102
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,005
What are you doing?

103
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,811
You're right to stay home.

104
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,315
Go to bed and get some sleep.

105
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,681
I'll see you later when I get back.

106
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,426
Why didn't you take your aspirin?
Take it, it'll do you good.

107
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,996
You still here?
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

108
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,723
Can't you see I had enough?

109
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,894
Get lost!

110
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,836
Who told you we were friends?

111
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,802
Get lost, will you?

112
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,674
And don't come borrowing my thermometer anymore!

113
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,971
Who's asking you for anything?
What a nut!

114
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,208
You're a sweetheart!

115
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,226
Someone would throw you in the river for 40,000 lire?

116
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,196
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

117
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,303
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

118
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,895
Someone who loves you?

119
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,171
What love?
You met him a month ago.

120
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,742
You don't know his name or where he lives.

121
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,675
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

122
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,407
He pushed you in the river!

123
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,182
And you were lucky,
because if it had been me...

124
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,481
I'd have held your head under myself! 
You nut!

125
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,422
Tell the cops!

126
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,650
I'm no stool pigeon!

127
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,430
Take my advice!
Report him!

128
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,670
But why? Why'd he do it?
I gave him everything.

129
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,831
I gave him everything he wanted.
He didn't have to do it.

130
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,548
I'm such a moron.

131
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,205
What if I died?

132
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,608
That's it! The party's over!

133
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,280
We're through! Finished!

134
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,575
Silk shirts! I'll give you silk shirts!

135
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,652
Find another jerk like me!

136
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,916
Look what I bought him!
A checked suit!

137
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,222
Camel-hair coat!
Never again! Never!

138
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,596
And who's gonna feed you now?
St. Peter?

139
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,860
Eternal love!

140
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,162
You dirty <i>vitellone!</i>

141
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,466
Go back to selling balloons!

142
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,007
I'll burn it all!

143
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,875
Chicken soup, veal chops.

144
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,115
You should drop dead!

145
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,999
This is the last time!
You'll never see me here again.

146
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,905
This is my last evening.
I shouldn't even be seen with you!

147
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,507
Look how classy I am.

148
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,583
You look like Moby Dick to me.

149
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,719
How dare you!

150
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,688
Know where you belong?
In the nuthouse!

151
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,692
Use your eyes!
Take a good look at me!

152
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,764
Look at me. A <i>grande dame.</i>

153
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,428
She gets worse all the time.

154
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,937
They oughta put her away.

155
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,268
That's how you'll end up!

156
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,035
And that's the heater.

157
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,510
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

158
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,081
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

159
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,081
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

160
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,776
Come on, move!

161
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,851
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

162
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,720
You don't know how to drive.

163
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,427
It's my car. I can do what I want with it. 
Get out.

164
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,623
I'll visit you in the hospital.
This I gotta see.

165
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,266
Why not the bigger model?

166
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,530
Another one! What do you know about cars? 
You're always in the bushes!

167
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,973
You're always on two wheels!

168
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,608
Here comes the psycho again.

169
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,643
- Bye, handsome.
- Bye, sweetie.

170
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,584
Remember to come see your princess.

171
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,324
Cute! Real fancy!

172
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,830
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

173
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,400
It's a fancier color.
But this one's cute.

174
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,335
You're gonna kill the battery!

175
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,838
Wanda, get out.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

176
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,408
Neither do I, you fanatic.

177
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,113
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

178
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,411
With a car, life's a lot different.
You sit up there, high up...

179
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,817
and you signal right, left,
vroom-vroom.

180
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,791
People think you're well off,
a secretary, a daddy's girl.

181
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,658
The men all chase you.
It feels great!

182
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,629
- Listen to her!
- What?

183
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,997
I know how she got that car!

184
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,564
That cokehead!

185
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,628
Wait!

186
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,463
Stay right here!

187
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,700
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

188
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,685
You're dancing, Cabiria?

189
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,218
You're in luck!
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

190
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,357
Come on!

191
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,831
Now she found another deadbeat to say 
"I love you."

192
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,904
One who'll send her off begging.

193
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,667
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

194
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,576
Here I am, gentlemen!
Here I am!

195
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,382
Just as well.
Who needs you!

196
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,022
Where you going with the car? 
To the old-age home?

197
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,917
Maybe if you were 20 years younger!

198
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,818
Filthy flea bag!

199
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,431
You're just jealous!

200
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:26,201
Hear that, Cabiria?
She can't get away with that!

201
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,670
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

202
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,572
"Please, be kind. Have a heart!"

203
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,283
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

204
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,712
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

205
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,185
Wanda, here we go again.

206
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,427
Forza, Cabiria!

207
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,037
Never mind her!
Hit her low, in the belly!

208
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,207
Don't stop them!
It's too much fun!

209
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,137
Stop it before the cops come!

210
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,546
I'll kill her!

211
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,113
Let go of me!

212
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,589
Get her in the car.

213
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,452
Get her away!

214
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,064
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

215
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,093
I'll punch you a new face!

216
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,434
It's not over yet!

217
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,078
She ruined my face!

218
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,511
Forget about her.

219
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,345
You're scared of me, right?

220
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,988
You lousy loser!

221
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,024
Have a smoke.

222
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,567
Where you wanna go?

223
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,161
To Via Veneto.

224
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,704
Via Veneto?
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

225
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,678
Listen, Cabiria, you and me 
oughta have a talk one of these days.

226
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,508
You're not doing it right.

227
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,547
Who's watching over you?

228
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,019
Look at Marisa and me.

229
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,212
She's safe wherever she goes.

230
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,824
Nobody in Rome would harm a hair on her head.

231
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,818
You know why?

232
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,552
Let me out.

233
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,061
What do you expect to do here?

234
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,397
Girls fight for spots on
Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

235
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,441
Cabiria, why not find yourself a serious man? 
Respectable, like me.

236
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,703
I don't need one.

237
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,506
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

238
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,879
Why should I slave for filthy pigs like you?

239
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,280
Let's drop it.

240
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,786
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

241
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,014
Yeah, it's better.

242
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,822
So long!

243
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,516
Moron! Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the <i>Passeggiata Archeologica!</i>

244
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,740
Can't I look?

245
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,751
Know how gorgeous you are?

246
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,446
Get going.

247
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:14,253
Oh, yeah? 
We'll I'm staying right here! See?

248
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,092
Sorry.

249
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,297
Are you blind?

250
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,772
Jessie!

251
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,508
Jessie! How can this happen?

252
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,046
Alberto Lazzari!

253
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,711
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

254
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,986
Jessie, cut it out!

255
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,483
Let go!

256
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,657
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

257
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,195
Give me the keys.

258
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,700
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

259
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,564
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

260
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,540
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

261
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,812
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

262
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,811
Jessie, dear, listen.

263
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,388
Listen one last time.

264
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,686
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

265
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,489
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

266
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,926
You louse!

267
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,430
- Wait a second.
- What for?

268
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,030
You can go.

269
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,899
Lousy second-rate ham!

270
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,846
Listen, Jessie. 
If you don't come back, it's over!

271
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,407
Fine! It's over!

272
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,107
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

273
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,712
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

274
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,180
What do you want?
Go away!

275
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,539
Hey, you!

276
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,474
I'm talking to you!

277
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,410
Get in.

278
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,212
Who, me?

279
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,220
Yes, you. Hurry up. Get in.

280
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,065
Fast!

281
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,670
Close it.

282
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,368
Get out.

283
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,638
But why?

284
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,313
Come on, get out.

285
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,213
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

286
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,949
What's going on here?

287
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,050
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

288
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,285
Make up your mind!

289
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,056
Come on. Let's have some fun.

290
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,926
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

291
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,956
How are you, sir? How about a table?
Tonight's show is exceptional.

292
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,927
Your umbrella, <i>Signora?</i>

293
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,470
Right this way, <i>Signora.</i>

294
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,780
Who's that?

295
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,828
May I help you?

296
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,100
Sit over here. Come on.

297
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:24,960
Please.

298
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,498
Sit over there.

299
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,847
Alberto!
Monica.

300
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,889
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

301
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,959
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

302
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,790
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,659
Yesterday the Americans gave me a screen test.

304
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,693
It turned out fantastic.

305
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,999
I have a 16-millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

306
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,846
Ladies and gentlemen, that was part one of our show. 
Before you dance...

307
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,549
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is...

308
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,393
honoring us with his presence.

309
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,696
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

310
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,427
Okay, boys! Mambo number 26!

311
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,011
Do me a favor, come to our table.

312
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,079
A bunch of my friends would love to meet you.

313
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,113
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

314
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,716
I'm with the lady.

315
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,243
Let's dance.

316
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:50,070
Mambo. The world turns around the mambo.

317
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,305
What a mambo.

318
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,917
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

319
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,491
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

320
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:46,993
What?

321
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,298
Don't let me keep you from your friends.

322
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,168
That's enough. Let's go.

323
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,668
Good night, <i>Commendatore.</i>

324
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,699
Get in. Hurry up!

325
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,133
- Did you eat?
- No. Well, a little bit around 8:00.

326
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,474
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

327
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,700
Let's have supper.

328
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,402
Good. Where are we going?

329
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,705
My house.

330
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,045
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

331
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,344
I'm talking to you!

332
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,878
Look at me!

333
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,787
Look who I'm with!
Up yours!

334
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,022
Know who this is?

335
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,626
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, <i>Commendatore.</i>

336
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,458
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

337
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,605
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

338
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,796
All right.

339
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,634
Supper for two in my room.

340
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:37,742
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

341
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,473
If she still insists, I'm still asleep!

342
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,786
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

343
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,656
What?

344
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,656
Come on, move.

345
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,973
What? Another dog?

346
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,132
Look at these!

347
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,304
You got fish too?

348
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,041
Yes.
Now, where did I put it?

349
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,038
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

350
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,052
Idiot! What made me do it?

351
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,350
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

352
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,153
Just leave it!

353
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,640
Come.

354
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,989
What was your name again?

355
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,170
Where are you from?

356
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,230
What?

357
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,239
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. <i>Piazza Risorgimento.</i>

358
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,115
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

359
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,693
You like it?

360
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,670
Kind of.

361
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,299
It's not really my thing.

362
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,474
It's not my taste, but, yes.

363
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,703
Beethoven's Fifth.

364
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,281
I love it.

365
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:31,877
Come in.

366
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,064
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it. Go.

367
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,271
And close the door.

368
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,640
Let's see what he brought us.

369
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,079
Caviar, lobster.

370
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,848
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,858
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

372
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,366
1949...

373
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,899
1949...

374
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,770
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

375
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,783
Guess I tore it.

376
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,378
Where do you live?

377
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,186
Past the gas station.

378
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,792
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

379
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,886
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

380
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,396
I work the <i>Passeggiata Archeologica.</i>
Much more convenient.

381
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,400
Why?

382
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,161
I'm on the <i>Cilia.</i>
Subway takes me right there.

383
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,499
There's another girl, my friend Wanda.

384
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,404
She lives there too.
But I don't bother with the others.

385
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,580
The others sleep under the arches
in <i>Caracalla.</i>

386
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,510
Mind you, I have my own house...

387
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,744
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

388
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,922
Even a thermometer.

389
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,085
See this one here?

390
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,390
She never, ever
slept under an arch.

391
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,455
Well, maybe once.

392
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,657
Or twice.

393
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,002
Of course, my house is...

394
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,771
nothing like this.

395
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,167
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

396
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,216
Eat. Eat something.

397
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,382
What's wrong?

398
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,287
Damn it! I know who you are!

399
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,563
I know!
Can I say it?

400
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,621
Can I?

401
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,068
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you right away! 
I saw all your movies.

402
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:01,760
Very nice!

403
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,602
Which is your favorite?

404
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,435
Well, the last one.

405
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,909
You had a costume with all that stuff, 
then Vittorio Scraman came...

406
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,611
pushed the door open,
"Fermi tutti!"

407
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,778
Then it was his daughter.

408
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,083
That wasn't me.

409
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,880
What do you mean?

410
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,086
You're as good-looking as your house.

411
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,830
Bring the glasses here.

412
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,132
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

413
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,238
What's wrong now?

414
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,536
Who's gonna believe this when I tell 'em?

415
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,438
They already think I'm full of it.

416
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,280
I might not believe it myself tomorrow.

417
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,250
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture...

418
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,392
and write, 
"Cabiria was here at my house... Alberto Lazzari."

419
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,293
"Cabiria Ceccarelli was at my house."

420
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,962
Write it just like that.

421
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,761
Now let's eat.

422
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,560
And you eat too.

423
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,095
An olive.

424
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,575
Should I open it?

425
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:51,104
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

426
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,875
Here's your plate.

427
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,220
If you want to play more of that music, 
I'd like it too.

428
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,116
And what's this?

429
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,386
I saw it in a movie once.

430
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,262
- <i>Commendatore.</i>
- Yes, Davide.

431
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,958
- <i>It's Signorina Jessie.</i> 
- I said, tell her I'm sleeping.

432
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,091
- <i>She's here.</i>
- What?

433
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,928
- <i>She's downstairs.</i>
- Just don't let her in.

434
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,468
<i>She's already in.
She's coming up.</i>

435
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,370
Idiot!

436
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,611
Alberto, open up.

437
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,647
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

438
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,849
So? Open up.

439
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,822
It's very important.

440
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,087
One moment.

441
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,865
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

442
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,797
Alberto, will you open up?

443
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,102
Go in the bathroom a minute.

444
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,437
Yes. I'll get rid of her. Hurry!

445
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,137
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

446
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,182
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

447
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,551
Alberto, please open the door.

448
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,016
Open up, you bastard!

449
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,061
What do you want?

450
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,474
What's on your mind?

451
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,309
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

452
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,650
I'm working. You know that, right?

453
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,884
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

454
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,087
- What?
- I'm thirsty!

455
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,390
Now what?

456
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,260
I can't go on this way!

457
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,402
Well, neither can I!

458
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,837
Your jealousy is morbid, unbearable.

459
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,874
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

460
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,107
Let's call it quits 
while we're still friends, okay?

461
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,581
No. That's too easy!
I'm not going anywhere!

462
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,516
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

463
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,624
You're tired and I'm falling apart.

464
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,850
We'll call each other tomorrow.

465
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,215
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you that?

466
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,215
You've stopped loving me.

467
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,317
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

468
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,617
Admit it, and I'll never bother you again.

469
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,226
But I'd be lying.

470
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,495
Even if we saw each other occasionally...

471
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,426
every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

472
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,732
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

473
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,070
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

474
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:10,940
But stop being so jealous. 
Is it my fault that women always look at me?

475
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,140
But you're ugly!

476
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,944
How do I get out of here?

477
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,102
Hey, Cabiria. 
Alberto Lazzari's been lookin' for you!

478
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,413
I'm not even talking to you!

479
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,946
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

480
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,641
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

481
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,319
There's a winner.

482
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,349
Hey, you old lecher!

483
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,488
Homesick for jail?

484
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,595
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

485
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,533
Why'd you bring him along?
Guess a weed never dies.

486
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,797
The Madonna might have mercy on my uncle.

487
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:24,896
What mercy?

488
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,944
The pilgrims of the <i>Madonna del Divino Amore</i> 
just went by.

489
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,510
I don't believe that stuff.

490
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,610
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

491
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,977
Should we go there on Sunday?

492
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,052
We'll all have something to ask for.

493
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,883
You goin', Cabiria?

494
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,354
Me? I don't know. I'll think about it.
Besides...

495
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,655
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

496
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,663
I'll even be done with the mortgage soon.

497
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,996
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

498
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,169
We'll see.

499
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,701
Think the Madonna would waste a miracle on him?

500
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,905
Funny, huh? 
The Madonna knows how you made your dough.

501
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,547
Selling coke and pimping women.

502
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,980
I'm going to see the Madonna...

503
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,654
and I know exactly what I'll ask for.

504
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,552
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

505
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,591
You really want to go?

506
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,366
What'll you ask for?

507
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,601
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

508
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,572
Hey, you! Shorty!

509
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,442
Wanna lift?

510
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,431
<i>A shortcut.
He calls this a shortcut.</i>

511
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,339
<i>I've been walking an hour.</i>

512
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,510
<i>Who knows where I am?</i>

513
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,256
You live in the caves too?

514
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,488
I've never seen you before.

515
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,994
I've got my own house.

516
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,448
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

517
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,920
How are you doing?

518
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,957
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

519
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,060
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

520
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,460
They took him to the hospital two days ago.

521
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,601
Said he was in bad shape.

522
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:50,204
- And, you, what do you need?
- Whatever you want, thanks, sir.

523
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,799
Here's a blanket. Is that all right?

524
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,874
What hospital did they take Pietro to?

525
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,978
To the <i>Fratebenefratelli.</i>

526
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:01,082
All right, I'll visit him if I have time.

527
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,663
Hey, Dark Hair.
Who is that guy?

528
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,531
But who is he?
With some charity?

529
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,841
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

530
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,822
Can I help you?

531
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,188
Going back to Rome later?

532
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,699
Can you give me a lift?

533
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,230
Yes, later.

534
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,906
Elsa!

535
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,356
Ah, <i>caro!</i>

536
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,353
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

537
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,828
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every nine or ten days.

538
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,868
He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

539
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,201
Bomba! But I know this one!

540
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,677
Bomba, you live here?

541
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,904
I wish I had everything I used to.

542
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,051
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia.

543
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:47,747
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank! Jewels! Gold!

544
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,949
I had five kilos of gold!

545
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,959
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

546
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,131
But this one in her day...

547
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,267
Here they don't even make me comb my hair.

548
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,404
But if I wear a low-cut blouse...

549
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,404
and the white earrings, then... ha!

550
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,308
Come, come, Elsa. Take this.

551
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,472
Oh! Look at the sweets you brought!

552
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,445
And only for me!
None for the others!

553
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,619
Give it to me to hide.

554
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,550
The one with the chocolate!

555
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:24,625
<i>Pignoli!</i> Look at the <i>pignoli!</i>
Like rainfall!

556
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:27,729
Thank you, <i>caro,</i> thank you!

557
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,168
And when will you be back?
When?

558
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:44,302
God protect you from evil, my son.

559
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:54,949
Of course...

560
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,659
there's lots of starving people in Rome, eh?

561
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,196
You drive around at night a lot?

562
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,530
Not as much as needed.

563
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,472
How about during the day?

564
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,712
No, in the daytime, the poor wander about.

565
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,615
How would I find them?

566
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,950
Go figure.

567
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,055
Me, I'm out at night too,
and I've never met you.

568
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,465
But how'd you get the idea...

569
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,694
the idea of doing this job?

570
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:45,807
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

571
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:53,238
We're here. There's your tram.

572
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,016
Do you live far from here?

573
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,219
About 19 kilometers, on the way to Ostia.

574
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,424
What's your name?

575
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,334
Maria Ceccarelli.

576
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:14,865
Are you alone?

577
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,603
My father and mother died when I was little.

578
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,538
I came to Rome later.

579
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,443
Now go and get some sleep.

580
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,062
So I...

581
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,963
<i>Arrivederci.</i>
Go ahead, tell me.

582
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,271
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

583
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,857
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

584
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,450
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

585
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,384
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

586
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,336
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

587
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,215
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

588
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,328
How much for the candles?

589
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,863
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150.

590
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,694
The biggest you got.

591
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,335
We'll take two each.

592
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,233
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

593
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,737
Are these all right?

594
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,005
I just want one. I'll pay for it myself.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

595
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,906
No, I'll pay for them all.

596
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,644
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

597
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,247
How much altogether?

598
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:01,966
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

599
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,598
So young!

600
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,879
We're over here! Wait for us!

601
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,810
We're gonna get photos!

602
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,912
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

603
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,111
Where's Wanda?

604
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,656
Wanda, come on!

605
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,324
Marisa!

606
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:29,954
Get lost!

607
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,898
With that nose you want a photo?

608
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,126
Who's takin' the picture?
How much?

609
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,336
Now what do we do?

610
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,838
You need to confess. 
Down there, where it says <i>confessione.</i>

611
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,941
I already confessed yesterday.

612
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,738
Watch out! He's a cripple!

613
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,672
I'm gonna ask for mercy from the Madonna too. 
Like you.

614
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,709
What am I asking for?

615
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,380
You don't remember?

616
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,346
I could ask for a villa in Peripli.

617
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,283
That's not what you said!

618
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:27,985
Don't you remember?

619
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,989
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

620
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,887
But you said you'd ask...

621
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,122
I changed my mind.

622
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,675
Why are you talking like that?

623
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,242
See? You made my candle go out.

624
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,475
Thirty masses at 1,000 each.
That's 30,000.

625
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,042
I gave them 35.

626
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,652
Yeah, you did okay.
You never know.

627
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,189
How's the act of contrition go?
I forgot.

628
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,992
"My Lord, I repent with all my heart."

629
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,727
- Yeah. What's after that?
- It's written in the confessional.

630
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,395
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

631
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,998
That's enough for now!

632
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,576
Use the other entrance!

633
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,950
Take it easy. Don't push!

634
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,087
I'm sick. I can't help it.

635
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,256
He's sick too. Can't you see that?

636
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,619
Careful, Uncle.

637
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,692
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't.

638
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,803
I can't go on. I can't move.

639
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,804
I'll hold you till we're at the altar.

640
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,065
I gotta rest.

641
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,972
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

642
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,409
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

643
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,815
Everyone has a secret agony.

644
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,813
Everyone has a wish for You to fulfill.

645
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,651
Open your heart to the suffering,
O Holy Virgin!

646
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:15,592
Mercy, Madonna!

647
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,926
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

648
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,668
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

649
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,312
Wanda, over here!

650
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,560
Stay close.
What happens next?

651
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,854
I don't know!

652
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,998
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

653
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,828
I feel so strange, Wanda.

654
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,409
Now all kneel and pray.

655
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,921
Amleto, will the Madonna 
bestow Her grace on me?

656
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,591
I think so.

657
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,556
Now approach the altar of the Virgin.

658
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:33,701
Look into Her sweet eyes,
and in Her glance, each one of you...

659
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:38,803
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

660
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,226
Madonna, help me...

661
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,930
to change my life.

662
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,896
Bestow your grace on me too.

663
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,235
Make me change my life.

664
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,508
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

665
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,181
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

666
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,441
I'm afraid!

667
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:22,506
I'm holding you!

668
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:28,824
Madonna, I'm a sinner.

669
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,449
A worm of the earth.

670
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:34,629
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

671
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,891
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

672
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:12,066
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

673
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,632
What are you doing?

674
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,296
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

675
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,906
- What did she say?
- She says she's thinking.

676
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:23,171
Too much thinking will make your head explode.

677
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,811
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

678
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,542
They're doing it on purpose!

679
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,380
I'll fix 'em!

680
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,191
Next time I'll kick it the other way!

681
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:53,907
You wanna stay here by yourselves?
Uncle and I will leave. Just say so.

682
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,772
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

683
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,779
- What if we wanted to?
- What's the matter, Cabiria?

684
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,843
Hey! Come over here and get your ball!

685
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,887
Come over here if you want it!

686
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,855
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

687
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,894
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

688
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,964
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

689
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,065
What are you doing, you nut?

690
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,771
We haven't changed.

691
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,467
Nobody's changed!

692
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,881
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

693
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,447
What do you want to change, Cabiria?

694
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,886
You think this is the end?

695
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,288
You know what I'm gonna do?

696
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:50,330
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

697
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,134
Good-bye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

698
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:55,993
Where'll you go?

699
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:59,401
Where? Think I'm like you?

700
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,075
I know where I can go. I know.

701
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,177
Just look at those little nuns!

702
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:12,515
Where you going with that banner?

703
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,417
Looking for snails?

704
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,755
Why'd you make her drink?

705
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,317
I made her drink?

706
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,866
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

707
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,301
Did she?

708
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,138
Cabiria! You wanna get us arrested?

709
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,608
Amleto, look at her!

710
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:34,765
What?

711
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,137
Bring her back!

712
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,304
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

713
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:44,319
Come here, kids!
Come enjoy yourselves!

714
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,951
Come dance with us!

715
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,351
Forget about your banner!

716
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:56,794
Why do you always butt in?
Get lost!

717
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,568
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

718
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,638
- Leave me alone!
- You're blind drunk!

719
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,332
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

720
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,897
Is the show any good?
Hey! I asked you a question!

721
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,299
You want me to say it stinks?

722
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:45,300
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, 
my assistant's head...

723
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,439
has been completely impaled by the daggers.

724
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,973
There's no doubt
that his head must be...

725
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,080
soaked in blood.

726
01:10:56,218 --> 01:11:01,087
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

727
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,769
In the second part of our show, 
we'll feature...

728
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,371
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

729
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:21,771
Would anyone in the audience care to volunteer? 
<i>Prego, Signori!</i>

730
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,342
I will!

731
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,914
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

732
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,784
There's absolutely no danger.

733
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:46,133
We now need a representative of the fair sex.

734
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,427
- How about you, <i>Signorina?</i>
- Who, me?

735
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,896
Yes, you! Good! Come up.
Be brave!

736
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,331
No, I don't want to.

737
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,806
Would you leave those young men up there all alone?

738
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,274
You go, then!

739
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,505
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

740
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,183
Wanna laugh?

741
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,083
Just look in the mirror!

742
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,854
Come on, <i>Signorina,</i>
don't make us beg.

743
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,014
Should I come and get you?

744
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,955
I'll come and get you.

745
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,995
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

746
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,525
They're all tricks.

747
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:20,530
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

748
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,635
Think I'm scared?

749
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,972
It's all fixed anyway.

750
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:32,113
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

751
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:36,842
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

752
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,785
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

753
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:46,188
I completely forgot that <i>Signorina</i> Elvira 
is still inside.

754
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,700
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

755
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:57,804
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

756
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,531
I was on the Isle of Elba as a kid.

757
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,643
You barely got to Ostia.

758
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:06,679
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

759
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,816
Ah, here's our boat.

760
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,680
We named her intrepid 
because she always defies the waves.

761
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,550
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

762
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,248
<i>Signorina,</i> you stay here.

763
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:22,328
The boat is waiting. 
The sea is calm, and the weather is fine.

764
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,222
I'm getting out of here!

765
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:25,764
Where are you going?

766
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,867
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

767
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,507
Look into my eyes!

768
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,789
Take the oars and start rowing.

769
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:01,033
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

770
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:05,570
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

771
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,606
Dolphins!

772
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,641
Boy, look at 'em jump!

773
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,771
One of you doesn't feel so good.

774
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,280
Things are looking bad, boys.

775
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,249
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

776
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,252
Hear the wind whistling.

777
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,750
It's a hurricane!

778
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,218
Help! Hold the rudder!

779
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,396
It's every man for himself!

780
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,337
<i>Mamma mia bella!</i>
I'm drowning!

781
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,799
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been too!

782
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,434
You were plenty scared!

783
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,005
Where are you going?

784
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,535
- You mean me?
- Yes.

785
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,777
- Isn't it over?
- No.

786
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:19,379
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

787
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,476
What's he want now?

788
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,307
<i>Signora</i> or <i>signorina?</i>

789
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,855
- Did you have fun watching?
- Not really.

790
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,859
I'd like to talk with you a moment. 
Come here.

791
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,063
- Are you from Rome?
- Yeah, I live in Rome.

792
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:44,635
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

793
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,029
In Prati.

794
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:52,673
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

795
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:54,905
In Borgata San Francesco.

796
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,092
What's so funny?

797
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,160
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just joking.

798
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:12,891
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

799
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:14,902
Why should I get married?

800
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,905
- I'm no dope.
- Who'd marry her!

801
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,834
All girls want to get married.

802
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:26,344
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

803
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,404
Me?

804
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,608
He's rich, handsome,
rides a horse and drives a Ferrari.

805
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,514
Let's see if we can arrange it.

806
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,680
What type of work do you do?

807
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,290
She's a countess!

808
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,288
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

809
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,295
And now I'm leaving.

810
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,970
I don't need anything!

811
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,028
That's a fact!

812
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,606
Even better.

813
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:59,372
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses.

814
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,640
I own the house I live in. Okay?

815
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,408
And now I'll get going.

816
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,576
One moment.

817
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,253
Don't make me look foolish.

818
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,087
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

819
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,556
Who the heck is Oscar?

820
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,260
Please step forward.

821
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,506
How elegant you look.

822
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,580
Come here. I'd like to introduce you 
to the <i>Signorina.</i>

823
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,314
She wanted to meet you too.

824
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,280
A pleasure.

825
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,014
The pleasure is all his, believe me.

826
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,527
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

827
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:57,837
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

828
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:03,101
You can talk, confide in each other. 
No one is listening.

829
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,674
Look, <i>Signorina,</i>
Oscar is offering his arm.

830
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:11,216
Come, <i>Signorina,</i> take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

831
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,820
But we just met.

832
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:18,291
You're strolling now.
The paths are full of flowers.

833
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,687
The birds are chirping.
Oscar dares not speak.

834
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,366
He's shy... sensitive.

835
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,626
Now he says, <i>"Signorina...</i>

836
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:32,170
I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

837
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,532
May I ask you a question?

838
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,738
You're not spoken for, are you?

839
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,582
There was never a man in your life?

840
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,483
Ah, I thought so.

841
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:51,383
I often see you standing by your window, 
and at Sunday mass.

842
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:56,326
Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

843
01:18:56,932 --> 01:19:01,926
That's good. 
Picking flowers indicates a gentle soul.

844
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,598
<i>Signorina,</i> may I hope to see you again?

845
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:13,346
Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

846
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:19,951
Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

847
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,779
Would you dance with me?"

848
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:25,390
Play, <i>Maestro.</i>
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

849
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:29,624
The orchestra will play a beautiful waltz.

850
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:38,466
"I'm wealthy, but I'm alone and unhappy.

851
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:42,234
What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

852
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,275
Smoke! Illusion!

853
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:49,415
What I really want is a home, children, 
and a wife like you."

854
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:54,581
When I was eighteen, 
that's when you should have known me!

855
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,555
I had long black hair.

856
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,184
This long.

857
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,628
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

858
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,160
Then it's true?

859
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,966
You really love me?

860
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,972
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

861
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,503
Do you really love me?

862
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,484
There, there. It's all right.

863
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,469
What happened?

864
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,340
What did you make me do?

865
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,289
Still here?
I have to close up.

866
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,790
I'm going! I'm going!

867
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,823
Listen, are those creeps still out there?

868
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,328
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

869
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,896
Now get going.
I gotta close up.

870
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,672
I'll show them a thing or two!

871
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,007
Pardon me, <i>Signorina.</i>

872
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,706
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

873
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,172
Forgive my boldness.

874
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,850
I don't normally stop young ladies in the street.

875
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,920
I was inside among the audience.

876
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,148
Oh! You were there, watching!

877
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,486
Great show!

878
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,051
I bet you like that stuff!

879
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:44,528
If I ever see that slimeball again...

880
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:48,430
<i>Signorina!</i>
Please, don't misunderstand me.

881
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,728
I agree with you!

882
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,603
In fact, I sympathize with you.

883
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:58,240
I came to tell you how moved I was.

884
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:04,751
We can all pretend to be cynical and scheming.

885
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:10,384
But when we're faced 
with purity and innocence...

886
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,758
the cynical mask drops off...

887
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:18,027
and all that is best in us awakens.

888
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:24,604
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

889
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,607
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

890
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,977
Excuse me.
It's the nighttime humidity.

891
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,313
May I buy you something?

892
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,388
I really don't know you.

893
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:49,955
Those damn creeps are still there!

894
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:55,596
Excuse my persistence, 
but these experiments with magnetism...

895
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,397
are extremely dangerous.

896
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:01,473
They can cause imbalances 
and other disturbances.

897
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,944
That's why I felt so strange!

898
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,583
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

899
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:11,982
How about that!

900
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,520
I would suggest a <i>Fernet.</i>
It'll do you good.

901
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,426
Come, we'll sit down.

902
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,417
Just a moment.

903
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,320
Please sit down.

904
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,464
Two <i>Fernet,</i> please.

905
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,611
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

906
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,849
When that charlatan spoke words of love to you 
in Oscar's name...

907
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,181
and you answered with such modesty 
and trepidation...

908
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,048
it made me sick.

909
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,651
Something hurt me in here.

910
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,720
I was ill. Really ill.

911
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,695
Hurry up. I'm closing.

912
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,668
Don't be upset.

913
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:08,332
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

914
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,178
Even amidst a crowd that laughs idiotically...

915
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,874
there's always someone who understands, 
who knows.

916
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:19,843
Someone who appreciates.

917
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:29,753
But what did I do?

918
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:34,995
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

919
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,897
I'm still deeply touched.

920
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:40,004
I can't even express it.

921
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:45,607
Yes. What struck me most...

922
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:50,745
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

923
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,217
When you went to Mass with your mother...

924
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:57,919
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

925
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,694
I really said that?

926
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:04,721
Closing time.

927
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,355
How much?

928
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:07,728
150 lire.

929
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,804
- Thank you.
- Hey, you, go sleep at home!

930
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,943
Listen, <i>Signorina.</i>

931
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:20,581
What happened tonight 
is extremely important to me.

932
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,773
Just imagine, if you will...

933
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:28,215
I'm not from around here.
I just came here by chance.

934
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:33,417
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

935
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:37,288
I went into that music hall
without knowing why.

936
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:42,061
There's no explanation for what happened. 
As if guided by fate.

937
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,170
Yes, that's the word: fate!

938
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,636
But who are you?

939
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,271
You sound like you're from Parioli.

940
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,807
What do you mean?

941
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,674
You talk like they do in Parioli.
A refined type.

942
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:58,614
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

943
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,617
What do you want from me?

944
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:07,024
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

945
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,821
It's Oscar. My name is Oscar.

946
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,523
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

947
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:18,101
So what? Your being Oscar 
could be a coincidence, no?

948
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:24,001
Sure. But isn't it strange 
that the hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

949
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:30,876
<i>Signorina,</i> I really must see you again. 
You're waiting for the bus?

950
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,781
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

951
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:38,117
Do we say good-bye now,
never to meet again?

952
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,487
Impossible.
I've got to see you again!

953
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:46,462
The city is vast and we still have so much 
to say to each other.

954
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:49,698
When and where can we meet again? 
Please!

955
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:54,464
I don't know. I'm busy. I work.

956
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:58,241
I'm a salesgirl. 
Anyway, what'll we say to each other?

957
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,208
- What?
- What would we say?

958
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,242
There's the bus. So long.
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

959
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,081
Please, don't say no.
I work too.

960
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,415
Maybe we can meet after work.

961
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:13,218
Like tomorrow evening. <i>Signorina,</i>
wait, how about tomorrow evening?

962
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:15,722
- In the evening I can't.
- Sunday afternoon, then?

963
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:16,589
Sunday?

964
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,765
Sunday, the <i>Stazione Termini,</i>
at 7:00.

965
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,059
I don't know. I feel so strange.

966
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,201
What're you doing?

967
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:27,565
Hurry. Let's go!

968
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,115
Here I am!

969
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:23,658
I was over there. Sorry I kept you waiting. 
I was in the wrong spot.

970
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,332
Thank you for coming here.

971
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:30,764
You might have thought me annoying, 
out of line.

972
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,167
It was all so strange...

973
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,336
as if I were dreaming.

974
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,939
I took the liberty, if you'll accept.

975
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,412
Thanks. You didn't have to.

976
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:46,144
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

977
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:50,516
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks and talks.

978
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:51,990
Boy, does he talk!

979
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,525
The type who reads a lot.
Well educated.

980
01:28:55,763 --> 01:28:58,823
Last night we saw a first-run movie 
at the Metropolitan.

981
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,967
- Hey! That's your third!
- They're so good!

982
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:02,432
I know they're good.

983
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:06,767
So we saw this first-run movie.
A costume picture.

984
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,965
Gladiators, with Christian martyrs.

985
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:13,944
He explained to me that it wasn't a true story.

986
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,616
It's make-believe,
just for the movies, understand?

987
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:19,013
And then, he told me that...

988
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:22,688
he gets a kick out of talking to me because...

989
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,687
because I understand him.

990
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,890
He's even good-looking.

991
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:30,655
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

992
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,095
Then we had pizza at a <i>trattoria.</i>

993
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,327
He always pays.

994
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,499
Even for the flowers.

995
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:39,332
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- Of course not.

996
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,565
Do me a favor, Cabi!

997
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:44,369
I'll be meeting him again tomorrow.

998
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:45,841
What's he after?

999
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,149
How do I know?

1000
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,342
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

1001
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,542
Oh, sure!

1002
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,817
The cops!
The cops!

1003
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,689
What you all need is jail!

1004
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,489
Arrest them all!

1005
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,930
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

1006
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,802
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

1007
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,373
How are you feeling?

1008
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,768
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here. For you.

1009
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,950
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

1010
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,675
- It's too much.
- Take it.

1011
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:01,645
Where shall we go?

1012
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:03,789
Wherever you want.

1013
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,959
It's a sunny day.

1014
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,889
Let's go to the <i>Aventino.</i>

1015
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,198
Your family's not from Rome?

1016
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:18,338
No. I have no family left.

1017
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:21,498
My mother and father died when I was a child.

1018
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:25,042
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone...

1019
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:26,373
than make compromises.

1020
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,076
We lived in Puglia, in a small village.

1021
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,312
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

1022
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:39,526
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

1023
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:43,557
My father owned a small plot of land. 
His name was Giovanni.

1024
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,730
My mother's name was Elsa, the poor soul.

1025
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,836
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

1026
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:55,208
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died...

1027
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,400
some ruthless relatives robbed my mother...

1028
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:00,741
of what little property she had, 
leaving us very poor.

1029
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:02,438
I went looking for work.

1030
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,799
What are you doing, my child?

1031
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:29,628
Good day, Father.

1032
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,668
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

1033
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,931
Sorry, I've no money on me.

1034
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:35,803
Never mind. Some other time.

1035
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,706
What's important is to always be in God's grace.

1036
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:41,881
You are in God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

1037
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:45,280
You're not in God's grace?

1038
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:50,121
Why not?

1039
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,228
Everyone should be in God's grace.

1040
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,525
Whoever lives in God's grace is happy.

1041
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:04,364
I'm in God's grace and I'm happy.

1042
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,697
I even went to the Madonna to ask for Her grace.

1043
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:13,812
Maybe you didn't know how to ask, 
or maybe you didn't need it.

1044
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:15,581
Are you married?

1045
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:20,213
That's bad. 
Girls should get married and make children.

1046
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:22,855
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

1047
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:26,857
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

1048
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:30,724
If you need me, I'm Brother Giovanni.

1049
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:36,832
I'm at the San Francesco Monastery, 
but I'm hard to find.

1050
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:39,764
I'm always running around.

1051
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:01,455
Hey, Blondie!

1052
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:10,035
So long!

1053
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:13,901
Tomorrow?

1054
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:15,837
Tomorrow I'm busy.

1055
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,035
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

1056
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:19,872
I'm busy then too.

1057
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:21,672
How come?

1058
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:27,246
I was gonna tell you...

1059
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,421
I don't know if I'll keep seeing you.

1060
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:30,749
But, why?

1061
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:38,157
It's not that I'm uncomfortable with you.

1062
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,229
But what's the point?

1063
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:45,032
What am I doing with you?

1064
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,934
We're both wasting our time.

1065
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:49,207
And doing what?

1066
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:52,604
Anyway, what do you want from me?

1067
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,406
If you want...

1068
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:57,781
I'll marry you.

1069
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:07,557
I wanted to ask you before.

1070
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:13,724
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to ask you...

1071
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:17,135
since the first time I saw you.

1072
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,563
What are you saying?

1073
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:23,133
Marry me?

1074
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:27,410
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

1075
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:28,946
Someone you don't know?

1076
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:30,978
That's not how it's done!

1077
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:35,147
Thank God I'm more honest than some others.

1078
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:38,414
Excuse me,
but that's not how it's done!

1079
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:41,154
What do you know about me?

1080
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,430
About who I am?

1081
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:47,556
Is this how it's done?

1082
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,402
You shouldn't fool somebody this way!

1083
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:53,070
Why pick on me of all people!

1084
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,170
Really!

1085
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,344
I've asked you no questions, 
and I don't want to know anything.

1086
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:08,919
Who cares?

1087
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:12,618
Prejudices don't touch me.

1088
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:18,260
Because what matters is...

1089
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:21,331
is that I know your inner self.

1090
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,661
We are... we are two lonely creatures.

1091
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:36,444
We have to stick together.
I need you.

1092
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,480
Don't tell me that.

1093
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:43,686
Don't say that, if it isn't true.

1094
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:44,654
But it is!

1095
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:01,237
What did you do?

1096
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:03,407
What is it, you nut?

1097
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:05,411
I'm getting married, that's what!

1098
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,044
He asked me to marry him! 
We're buying a store in <i>Grotta Ferrata!</i>

1099
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:12,515
He's almost signed the contract.

1100
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,679
Without me knowing, he arranged it all: 
a store, a house!

1101
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:21,555
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house...

1102
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,991
We're getting married in two weeks!

1103
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,427
Wanda, I'm leaving!

1104
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:30,530
Does he know that you...

1105
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:33,270
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

1106
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,567
I didn't hide anything from him.

1107
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:37,869
But he's a saint. An angel!

1108
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,945
He didn't want to know anything. 
He didn't care.

1109
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:44,207
He loves me! He loves me!

1110
01:38:44,518 --> 01:38:46,349
Wanda! He loves me!

1111
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,394
Who's there?

1112
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,434
May I see Brother Giovanni?

1113
01:39:11,645 --> 01:39:14,478
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

1114
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:17,980
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

1115
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,582
I want Father Giovanni to hear my confession.

1116
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:26,726
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

1117
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:30,155
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

1118
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,464
Fine. Then wait.

1119
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:48,303
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

1120
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:50,749
Should I take the owl?

1121
01:39:50,951 --> 01:39:54,182
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

1122
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,584
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

1123
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,021
I sold that.
Put it over there.

1124
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:04,663
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

1125
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,991
- Here are the dishes.
- I sold them. Leave 'em!

1126
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:09,134
Them too?

1127
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:11,794
Why not?
I got paid for them.

1128
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:14,941
It would've cost more to move everything.

1129
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:18,134
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything too.

1130
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,210
We're starting over!
Everything new.

1131
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:25,043
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

1132
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:26,550
What could I forget?

1133
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:30,314
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

1134
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,326
See? You forgot your fur.

1135
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:34,722
Fur? What fur?

1136
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:37,887
- No! I don't want that.
- How about giving it to my aunt?

1137
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,828
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

1138
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,367
Damn it! Those lowlifes.

1139
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,731
Close the suitcase, will you?
Tight.

1140
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:49,464
Oh, <i>la mamma!</i>

1141
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:59,312
Take one more look,
and then I'm getting married.

1142
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,375
What?

1143
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:02,251
I'm getting married too.

1144
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:04,150
What did I say? Nothing.

1145
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,162
How do I look?

1146
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,434
Looks good on you.

1147
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,334
It cost me 1,200 lire.

1148
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:24,204
You got robbed.

1149
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,508
You paid too much.

1150
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:30,215
Ah, my pocketbook.

1151
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:33,411
Good-bye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

1152
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,549
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

1153
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,899
See them? 
I can't stand those starving bastards.

1154
01:41:57,478 --> 01:41:58,911
Let's go.

1155
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:09,050
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. <i>Arrivederci.</i>

1156
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:14,792
If you need anything, 
just tell my friend, <i>Signorina</i> Wanda.

1157
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,328
She'll write to me.
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

1158
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:19,930
Have a good trip. Good luck!

1159
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,829
Thank you. Likewise.

1160
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:40,786
Never mind. 
I don't wanna say good-bye to anybody.

1161
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:43,019
It's better that way.

1162
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:45,817
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

1163
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:47,618
they'll ask questions.

1164
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:48,854
Ah! Luciana!

1165
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:50,689
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

1166
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:54,662
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

1167
01:42:57,137 --> 01:42:59,833
Say good-bye to Nando and his uncle, 
and to everyone.

1168
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,312
Nice, eh?

1169
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:13,444
They're pretty.

1170
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,553
You're getting married...

1171
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:23,992
and I never met this fianc of yours.

1172
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:26,791
I couldn't bring him where everybody knows me.

1173
01:43:28,235 --> 01:43:29,668
Here's the bus.

1174
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:33,564
It's here.

1175
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:43,079
Ciao, Wa'.

1176
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:44,708
Why are you crying?

1177
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:47,584
Who's crying?

1178
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:49,686
Aren't you crying?

1179
01:43:51,858 --> 01:43:55,919
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

1180
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,032
And you'll get married too.

1181
01:43:59,433 --> 01:44:00,422
Let's go.

1182
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:06,236
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

1183
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:21,085
Stay out of trouble. You'll...

1184
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:23,281
You'll get a miracle, like me.

1185
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:26,583
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

1186
01:45:08,835 --> 01:45:10,735
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

1187
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:14,270
- But there's no reason.
- Please! You've always paid.

1188
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:17,140
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

1189
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:19,744
It's all the same, isn't it?

1190
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,274
Waiter!

1191
01:45:30,924 --> 01:45:32,585
It's getting late.

1192
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:38,593
You'll see how beautiful the sunsets are up here.

1193
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,967
You want to get me drunk?

1194
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:50,371
It's such a light wine.

1195
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,051
The money.

1196
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:04,688
Put it away.

1197
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:08,224
It's my dowry.

1198
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:14,864
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

1199
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:18,231
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

1200
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:21,532
Then I got all my money from the bank.

1201
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:23,175
400,000.

1202
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:26,538
See? I made them give me all new bills.

1203
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:50,035
Because you never asked if I had money.

1204
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:54,065
You, you're an angel, a saint!

1205
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:58,605
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

1206
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:02,776
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

1207
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,114
Let's get away from here.

1208
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:09,017
The beatings I took.

1209
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:13,017
You see, some guys are just after a girl's money.

1210
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:14,853
You wouldn't believe it.

1211
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:18,860
Everything for love.
But not that way.

1212
01:47:19,299 --> 01:47:22,063
But what about my old age?

1213
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:24,034
Who worries about my old age?

1214
01:47:24,971 --> 01:47:26,802
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1215
01:47:28,975 --> 01:47:30,465
Waiter, keep the change.

1216
01:47:31,311 --> 01:47:32,243
Let's go.

1217
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:36,874
I didn't want to go on like that forever.

1218
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:39,950
I'd have quit if I could, even tomorrow.

1219
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:42,087
I'd have gone away.

1220
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:46,055
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

1221
01:47:46,259 --> 01:47:47,988
Know what me and Wanda planned?

1222
01:47:48,228 --> 01:47:51,755
We were gonna rent a newsstand.

1223
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:55,263
Understand?
Where are we going?

1224
01:47:55,569 --> 01:47:57,059
It's so nice here.

1225
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,670
Let's take a little walk. Okay?

1226
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,970
I don't even remember how I started.

1227
01:48:03,176 --> 01:48:06,805
I was a child, that's all I remember.

1228
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,604
And the suitcases?

1229
01:48:08,682 --> 01:48:10,149
We'll take them later.

1230
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:14,413
You should have seen me at 15...

1231
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:16,884
with my long black hair...

1232
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:18,015
down to here.

1233
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,319
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

1234
01:48:21,528 --> 01:48:23,018
Where are we going?

1235
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,528
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

1236
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:28,401
What's the name of that song?

1237
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:43,509
Won't you kiss me?

1238
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:08,930
Come.

1239
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,277
I know a shortcut.

1240
01:49:41,308 --> 01:49:43,003
Oscar! Where are you?

1241
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:47,072
What a bad boy you are!

1242
01:49:49,816 --> 01:49:52,114
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

1243
01:49:52,452 --> 01:49:54,477
They stink, but still.

1244
01:49:55,155 --> 01:49:57,350
I never saw flowers like these before.

1245
01:49:57,657 --> 01:49:58,851
Let's go.

1246
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:00,423
I'm coming.

1247
01:50:03,697 --> 01:50:06,495
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

1248
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,430
What's wrong? Are you sad?

1249
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:11,136
Me? No. Why?

1250
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:13,704
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

1251
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:21,213
Why don't we carve our initials on the trees?

1252
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,875
Let's go. 
The sunset is beautiful in the woods.

1253
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:29,020
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

1254
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,738
What a strange light.

1255
01:51:02,188 --> 01:51:03,212
Beautiful, isn't it?

1256
01:51:06,926 --> 01:51:10,089
I guess there is some justice in the world.

1257
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:15,428
You suffer, you go through hell...

1258
01:51:16,936 --> 01:51:20,838
but then happiness comes along for everyone.

1259
01:51:23,376 --> 01:51:25,435
You've been my angel.

1260
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:28,779
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

1261
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:33,578
Having regrets?

1262
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:38,016
Beautiful, eh?

1263
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:41,450
Look how deep it is!

1264
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:44,720
I'd love a boat ride right now.

1265
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:47,957
Are there any boats down there now?

1266
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,533
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

1267
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:53,904
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

1268
01:51:54,107 --> 01:51:56,302
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

1269
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:01,035
What's wrong?

1270
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:17,760
What's the matter?

1271
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:23,629
You don't want to kill me, do you?

1272
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:26,967
Answer me!

1273
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:30,165
You want to kill me?

1274
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:33,674
You want to kill me!

1275
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:37,911
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

1276
01:52:38,852 --> 01:52:43,346
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

1277
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:46,147
Tell me.

1278
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:53,161
For... the money?

1279
01:52:57,003 --> 01:52:58,368
For the money.

1280
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:29,325
Kill me! Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

1281
01:53:29,536 --> 01:53:31,868
I don't wanna live anymore!

1282
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:39,635
I don't wanna live anymore!

1283
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:43,544
Kill me! Throw me off the cliff!

1284
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:47,813
I don't wanna live anymore!

1285
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:50,713
Go ahead!

1286
01:53:50,924 --> 01:53:53,324
Shut up, stupid!

1287
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:58,156
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

1288
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:01,323
I don't wanna live anymore!

1289
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:08,399
Kill me! Kill me!

1290
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:35,288
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving!

1291
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,665
We're gonna lose our way going home!
