1
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:10,100
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:11,832
Time to wake up.

3
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:13,329
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,634
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,298
That's what Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:26,347
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,977
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:30,484
All right.

9
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,681
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!

10
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,156
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,715
Your breakfast is getting cold.

12
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:37,124
It's cereal.

13
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:38,627
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,111
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:03,879
Okay.

16
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,061
Here's your books.

17
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,397
Go ahead.

18
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,215
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment,
I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,110
Yes, she's coming right now.

20
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,745
Just a second, she'll be with you.

21
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:15,724
Just one second, please. You deal with this one.
I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,696
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,963
I can see you're on a party line...

24
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:27,135
Unfortunately, some people do listen in
on party lines. We...

25
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:28,831
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:33,132
Oh, my...

27
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,541
Everything all right?

28
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,174
Yes, sir, it's fine.
A lady was having trouble with the connection.

29
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,974
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, Mom.

30
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,450
How was school?

31
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,748
- Okay.
- Yeah?

32
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,789
We learned about dinosaurs.

33
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:48,154
And I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.

34
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,283
What happened?

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,486
He hit me.

36
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,085
Did you hit him back?

37
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,460
Good.

38
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:54,793
Rule number one, remember?

39
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,561
Never start a fight, always finish it.

40
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:59,793
Why'd he hit you?

41
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,167
Because I hit him.

42
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,530
You hit him first?

43
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,065
Why?

44
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,711
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

45
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,146
Honey, your father never met you,

46
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,150
so how could he not like you?

47
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:16,015
Then why did he leave?

48
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:21,046
Well, because the day you were born,

49
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,525
something else arrived in the mail.

50
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,520
And it was in a box
a little bit bigger than you.

51
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:27,223
You know what was in it?

52
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:29,061
Something called responsibility.

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,124
And to some people,

54
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:33,966
responsibility is the scariest thing
in the world.

55
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:39,403
So, he ran away because he was scared
of what was in that box?

56
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,501
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,909
That's just dumb.

58
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,742
That is exactly what I thought.

59
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:57,892
Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?

60
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,862
I'm afraid so, sport.

61
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,796
Come now, time for bed.

62
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,535
Are we still going to the movies tomorrow?

63
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:12,872
Uh-huh. I hear there's a new
Charlie Chaplin picture

64
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,741
and a new serial called
The Mysterious Airman.

65
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,207
Who's that?

66
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,249
I don't know. Nobody does.

67
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,477
That's what makes him so mysterious.

68
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:22,541
Oh.

69
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,047
Am I too heavy for you to carry?

70
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:27,784
Oh, no, not for years.

71
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,348
Not for years.

72
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,393
<i>- Hello?
- This is Margaret.</i>

73
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,630
Hi, Margaret.

74
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:41,693
<i>So, how are you?</i>

75
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,000
Fine.

76
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,337
<i>Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.</i>

77
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,637
When did she call in sick?

78
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,768
<i>About half hour ago.</i>

79
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:49,506
<i>I'm having a hard time trying to find someone.</i>

80
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,309
Well, what about Myrna?

81
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,747
I know she could use the extra hours and...

82
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,909
<i>She's busy. Can't you come?</i>

83
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,747
No. No, no, no.
I just...

84
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,456
I promised Walter that I'd take him to the movies,
is all, and...

85
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:04,926
<i>Well, it's just until 4:00.</i>

86
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,189
All right.

87
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,060
Just...
Just until 4:00.

88
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,130
I'll see you then.

89
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:18,298
There's a sandwich and milk in the fridge,

90
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,899
and I've asked Mrs. Riley and her daughter

91
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,740
to stop in in a couple of hours.

92
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:23,973
I can take care of myself.

93
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,676
I know you can.
They're checking on the house, not you.

94
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,655
Tomorrow we will go to the movies.

95
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:42,699
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa Monica
and take a walk on the pier.

96
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,996
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

97
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:50,369
I'll be home before it gets dark.

98
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,335
I'm not afraid of the dark.

99
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,206
I'm not afraid of anything.

100
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,843
I know. I know.

101
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,975
Be good.

102
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:03,710
I love you.

103
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,524
We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio.

104
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,026
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.

105
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:47,756
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

106
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,856
- Number, please.
- Number, please.

107
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,201
Go ahead, please.

108
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:56,268
All right, get me the Omaha routing station.

109
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,740
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

110
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,401
Let's get this console running, now.

111
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:08,048
Christine.
Good, I was hoping to catch you.

112
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,511
Look, I've been following your work reports,

113
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,782
and I just want to let you know
that I am very impressed.

114
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:15,290
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,

115
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,917
my superiors weren't big on the idea.

116
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:19,861
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.

117
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,954
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

118
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,555
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...

119
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,725
Listen, the point is,

120
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:26,599
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

121
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,696
And if you're interested in the job,
I could write a report, or...

122
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,570
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

123
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:33,906
Okay, good, so maybe we could...

124
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,444
- Could we speak about it Monday?
- Yeah, absolutely.

125
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:38,003
Would that be all right?
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

126
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,385
Please!

127
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,289
Please.

128
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,391
Walter.

129
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:27,490
Honey?

130
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,832
Walter.

131
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,396
Walter!

132
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,767
Honey?

133
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,348
Walter?

134
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:58,989
Honey!

135
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,430
Walter!

136
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:07,062
Walter, it's time to come in, honey.

137
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,832
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?

138
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:15,803
No, Mrs. Collins.

139
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,073
Sorry.

140
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,882
Walter?

141
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,626
Walter.

142
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,015
<i>Number, please.</i>

143
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,113
May I please have the police station?

144
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,714
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

145
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,781
<i>Lincoln Heights Division.</i>

146
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,657
Hello, my name is Christine Collins.

147
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,253
I live at 210 North Avenue, 23.

148
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,232
And I'm calling to report a missing child.

149
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,767
Missing child.

150
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,895
<i>What's your relation to the child, ma'am?</i>

151
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,371
It's my son.

152
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,667
<i>How long has he been gone?</i>

153
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,135
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.

154
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,641
It could be since this morning

155
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:26,444
or it could be just the last hour.

156
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:27,574
<i>Have you checked around the neighborhood?</i>

157
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,380
Yes, of course I did.

158
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,512
<i>Well, maybe he's lost track of time.</i>

159
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:32,850
No. No, no.

160
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:36,359
He always stays around the house
when it gets dark.

161
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,485
Would you please send someone down here?

162
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:39,960
<i>I'm sorry, but our policy is that</i>

163
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,989
<i>we don't dispatch units
on missing child cases for 24 hours.</i>

164
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:46,327
What?

165
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:49,861
<i>Look, 99 times out of 100,
the kid shows up by morning.</i>

166
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,841
<i>We don't have the resources to go chasing every kid
who runs off with his pals.</i>

167
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,003
No, no, no.

168
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:57,706
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.

169
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:02,115
<i>With all due respect, ma'am,
every parent who calls says the same thing.</i>

170
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:05,212
Please, please.

171
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,950
<i>Look, there's nothing I can do.</i>

172
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:08,491
<i>I'll take your name and your information,</i>

173
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,186
<i>but that's all until the morning,
at the earliest.</i>

174
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:14,287
<i>I'm sure he'll show up by then.
They always do.</i>

175
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,454
Are you Mrs. Collins?

176
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,737
<i>Our thoughts go out again today
to Mrs. Christine Collins</i>

177
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:05,247
<i>of Lincoln Heights,</i>

178
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,476
<i>whose young son, Walter Collins,</i>

179
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,076
<i>disappeared nearly two weeks ago.</i>

180
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,612
<i>Though she is not
a member of our congregation,</i>

181
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:18,419
<i>we pray for her today
as we have every day,</i>

182
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,729
<i>since we learned of her plight.</i>

183
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,664
<i>On the radio and in the newspapers</i>

184
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:27,670
<i>we are told that
the Los Angeles Police Department</i>

185
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:32,334
<i>is doing its very best
to reunite mother and child,</i>

186
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,809
<i>and I'm sure that that is true.</i>

187
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:40,976
<i>But given its status
as the most violent, corrupt</i>

188
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,019
<i>and incompetent police department</i>

189
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,316
<i>this side of the Rocky Mountains</i>

190
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,847
<i>I am not sure it's saying a great deal.</i>

191
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,832
<i>Every day, new bodies appear along Mulholland</i>

192
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,928
<i>and in the ditches of our cities,</i>

193
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:08,410
<i>the work of Police Chief James Davis
and his aptly named Gun Squad.</i>

194
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,845
<i>Every day, the needs of honest citizens</i>

195
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:16,147
<i>are put second to greed and personal gain.</i>

196
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:22,714
<i>Every day, this city sinks deeper
into a cesspool of fear,</i>

197
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:27,594
<i>intimidation and corruption.</i>

198
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:30,064
<i>Once the City of Angels,</i>

199
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:35,196
<i>Los Angeles has become
a place where our protectors</i>

200
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:37,763
<i>have become our brutalizers.</i>

201
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:42,805
<i>Where to be the law is
to be above the law.</i>

202
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:32,185
I understand.
Thank you.

203
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:34,059
I will call back in a few weeks.

204
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:36,395
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,968
Las Vegas Missing Persons Department?

206
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,269
Hello, this is Christine Collins.

207
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:47,208
I'm calling to see if you've found
any missing or lost children

208
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:51,145
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

209
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:56,051
Oh, all right.
Well, please do. Please do call.

210
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,677
And I'll call back in a matter...

211
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:00,518
In a week, if that's all right.
Thank you very much.

212
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,579
Thank you.

213
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,502
$2.

214
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,483
Hell, I think I left my wallet at home.

215
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:32,454
Can I owe it to you?

216
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,951
No credit.

217
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:36,686
Pay up or I call the cops.

218
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,591
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

219
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,095
I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.

220
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,654
I just left my wallet at home, that's all.

221
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:45,701
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

222
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,666
Got collateral?

223
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,506
You can't ask for better collateral

224
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:54,874
than a man's own flesh and blood, right?

225
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:57,470
Now, you stay here, son.

226
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,079
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,674
- But...
- Now, don't give me any trouble.

228
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,742
He's a good man to trust us like this.

229
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:08,388
Now, you just stay here
and I'll go back and get my wallet.

230
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,095
Ten minutes, then I call the cops.

231
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,764
Ah, hell.

232
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,338
<i>- Number, please.
- Hello, Myrtle?</i>

233
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,280
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.</i>

234
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,409
<i>Oh, hi, Harve.</i>

235
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,645
Would you get me Sheriff Larsen?

236
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,618
<i>Sure thing.</i>

237
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,151
You have a nice day, too.

238
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:46,655
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

239
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,595
I can't seem to get through.

240
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,065
I think so.
Yeah, I think that's better.

241
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,440
You have a person to person call,
Fairfax 2231.

242
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,998
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

243
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:01,839
I'll connect you right away, ma'am.

244
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,274
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,191
Mrs. Collins?

246
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:19,585
Yes.

247
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,364
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

248
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:27,963
My office supervises
all runaway and missing child cases,

249
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,903
including your son's, and...

250
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,572
He's alive, Mrs. Collins.

251
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,380
He was picked up two days ago
by local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

252
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,882
He's safe and unhurt.

253
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,381
He was in the company of some drifter.
We have an APB out for him,

254
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:47,480
but he's safe.

255
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:51,492
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:53,756
Oh, Christine...

257
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,062
That is so great.

258
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,100
Thank you.

259
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,751
There's so much press.

260
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,828
Yours is a story with a happy ending,
Mrs. Collins.

261
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,092
People love happy endings.

262
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,530
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

263
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:37,039
Back, boys. Back.

264
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,171
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!

265
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:40,732
I'll have a statement for you
in a few minutes,

266
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,868
but the important thing right now

267
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,708
is to reunite this little lady with her son,

268
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,145
so if you'll excuse us.

269
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,413
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

270
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:52,583
Easy, easy.

271
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:57,049
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you
to James E. Davis,

272
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,321
Chief of Police.

273
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,384
Very nice to meet you.

274
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:00,827
We don't get a lot of positive attention

275
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,387
from the boys in the press these days,

276
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,956
so it's good to be here with a positive story,
don't you think?

277
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,092
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,538
I take it you've been treated well
by my boys in the department?

279
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,700
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,

280
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,038
and I thought that maybe that was a...

281
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,543
Technicalities aside.

282
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,740
It was wonderful.

283
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:19,941
Well, good.

284
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:23,885
Then you won't have any trouble telling that
to the press,

285
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:25,887
and the fact that the LAPD...

286
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,251
Women.

287
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:31,486
Hold on a second.

288
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,160
Back, boys, back.

289
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:44,401
Keep them back.

290
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,885
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...

291
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:08,225
That's not my son.

292
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,661
What?

293
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:15,234
What are you saying?

294
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,302
It's not my son.

295
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,739
Well, I'm sure you're mistaken.

296
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:20,901
I'm not mistaken.

297
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:23,605
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

298
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,807
He's lost weight, he's changed.

299
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:27,577
I would know my own son.

300
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,448
All I'm saying is you're in shock
and he's changed.

301
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,983
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

302
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:35,684
Walter Collins.

303
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:39,417
It's a common name.

304
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,657
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

305
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:44,962
I live at 210 Avenue 23,

306
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:47,292
Los Angeles, California.

307
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,270
And that's my mommy!

308
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:57,410
Mrs. Collins, listen to me.
I understand.

309
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,472
You're feeling a little uncertain right now,
and that's to be expected.

310
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,916
A boy this age, he changes so fast.

311
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,921
We've compensated for that in our investigation.

312
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,958
And there's no question
that this is your son.

313
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,050
That is not Walter.

314
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:15,231
It's not Walter as you remember him.

315
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:19,930
And that's why it's important for you
to take him home on a trial basis.

316
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:22,895
A trial basis?

317
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,030
Yes, yes.

318
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:27,634
Once he's around his familiar surroundings,

319
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,646
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

320
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:34,478
you will see that this is your Walter.

321
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,111
Now, I promise you, I swear to you,
I give you my word.

322
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,813
This is your son.

323
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:42,449
Now, if you have any problems, any problems at all,
you come and you talk to me.

324
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:43,856
I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:47,860
I give you my word.
Trust me.

326
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,923
Mrs. Collins, he has nowhere else to go.

327
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:56,900
Please.

328
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:04,036
Maybe I'm not thinking clearly.

329
00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:05,944
And...

330
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:08,543
All right.

331
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:11,143
All right, you're not thinking clearly,
that's right.

332
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,653
Here we go!

333
00:24:13,156 --> 00:24:14,487
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:16,616
Here, just turn around here.

335
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,755
How does it feel to have your son home,
Mrs. Collins?

336
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,819
What'd you think when you saw him
for the first time?

337
00:24:20,897 --> 00:24:23,195
It's hard to explain.

338
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:25,097
She was shocked at first.

339
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:28,137
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

340
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:29,569
He's been through quite an ordeal.

341
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:31,106
How're you feeling, son?

342
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:32,232
Bet it feels great to be home.

343
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,605
Yeah. It's great.

344
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,837
The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful

345
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:39,109
for all the hard work done
by the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

346
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:41,810
in making this joyful reunion possible.

347
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:44,580
The LAPD is dedicated to serving the public
at all times.

348
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:47,282
Can we get a photo with mother and son, Captain?

349
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:49,552
Absolutely! Here we are.

350
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,386
Like that.
Like that.

351
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:54,021
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.

352
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:56,660
- This way, Walter.
- Big smile.

353
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,794
- One more, please.
- That's a good one.

354
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:01,130
One more.

355
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,124
The sandwich all right?

356
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:28,128
Would you like some more milk?

357
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:29,323
No.

358
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,962
No, thank you.

359
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:33,696
No, thank you.

360
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:44,136
You're covered in soot from the train.
You should take a bath.

361
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:58,019
Pajamas are on the edge of the bed.

362
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,725
You okay?
You all right?

363
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,767
I fell. Stupid tub!

364
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,264
That's all right.

365
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,736
You're circumcised.

366
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,511
Get out.

367
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,043
Move.

368
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:34,053
Last time I measured Walter,

369
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,394
last time I measured my son,

370
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,525
he was inches taller
than you are now.

371
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,902
Who are you?

372
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,130
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:46,764
Who are you?

374
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:49,238
Who are you?

375
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:03,889
He's not my son.

376
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,018
Mrs. Collins...

377
00:27:05,094 --> 00:27:07,221
No, I don't know why he's saying that he is,

378
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:09,025
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

379
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:11,123
I thought we agreed to give him time to adjust.

380
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,861
He's three inches shorter.

381
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:14,567
I measured him on the chart.

382
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,036
Well, maybe your measurements are off.

383
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:19,040
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation
for all of this.

384
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,439
He's circumcised.

385
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,408
And Walter isn't.

386
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:24,975
Mrs. Collins.

387
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,616
Your son was missing for five months.

388
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:35,248
For at least part of that time in the company
of an as yet unidentified drifter.

389
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:38,157
Who knows what such a disturbed individual
might have done?

390
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:42,022
He could have had him circumcised.
He could have...

391
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:43,565
Made him shorter?

392
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:49,869
Why aren't you listening to me?

393
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:52,931
I am listening, damn it,
I am listening.

394
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,533
And I understand your feelings.

395
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,737
He's changed, no mistake,
and that's...

396
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:58,440
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

397
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:01,415
and that's why he needs
your love and support to bounce back.

398
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,007
He's not my son!

399
00:28:04,153 --> 00:28:06,280
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?

400
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:07,447
Why are you doing this?

401
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:10,583
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

402
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,060
Your job pays you enough
to attend to his personal needs,

403
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:14,858
so I don't understand
why you're running away

404
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,728
from your responsibilities as a mother.

405
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,063
I am not running away from anything!

406
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,602
Least of all my responsibilities!

407
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,264
I am even taking care of that boy right now,

408
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,170
because I am all he has!

409
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,539
What worries me is that you have stopped
looking for my son!

410
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,104
Why should we be looking for someone
we've already found?

411
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:35,609
Because you have not found him.

412
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:38,119
His identity has been confirmed

413
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:41,679
by the best minds
in the field of child identification,

414
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:43,955
people who know what they're doing.

415
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,425
And I don't?

416
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,878
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,874
I appreciate everything
that this department has done

418
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:11,078
and I know how hard you're working.

419
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:14,247
I really do,
and I don't want to cause any trouble.

420
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:17,087
I just...
There has been a terrible mistake,

421
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,320
and I need you to help me correct it,

422
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:24,230
so I can find my son before it's too late.

423
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:27,628
Please.

424
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,342
I won't take up any more of your time.
I'm sorry I got upset.

425
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,350
I'm sorry, very sorry.

426
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,020
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

427
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,089
Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.

428
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,293
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

429
00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:05,631
- Mrs. Collins?
- Yes?

430
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,335
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

431
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,434
Captain Jones sent me.

432
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,945
I consult with him from time to time
on juvenile cases.

433
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:12,378
May I come in?

434
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:14,616
Yes, thank you for coming.

435
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,481
I was beginning to think he didn't believe me.

436
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:19,919
Well, I'm here now,
and we'll put all that to rights.

437
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,748
Where's the boy?

438
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:27,519
Ah! There he is.

439
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,525
A handsome young man.

440
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,064
He has your eyes, doesn't he?

441
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:35,365
And a little bit of the nose.

442
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:38,766
Very fit, in spite of all his travails.

443
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:42,140
A very resilient boy you've got here,
Mrs. Collins.

444
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:44,773
I thought you were here to help me.

445
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,337
Well, I am.

446
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:49,851
Captain Jones said that the boy
had been through some severe physical changes

447
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,443
and asked me to drop in on him,

448
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,114
to reassure you in your time
of motherly concern.

449
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:59,584
My motherly concern is not for him
because he's not my son.

450
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:04,824
Now, statements like that will hardly help
the boy's self-esteem,

451
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,299
now will they?

452
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,300
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

453
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,231
Yes.

454
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,673
Come.

455
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,143
Against the wall.

456
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,542
He's three inches shorter.

457
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,083
Ah, well...

458
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:30,685
Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.

459
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,060
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

460
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:37,292
Given the stress of the past five months,

461
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,826
his spine may have actually shrunk.

462
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:42,871
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

463
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,906
And circumcision?

464
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:54,175
Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate.

465
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,014
After all, circumcision is hygienically sound.

466
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,390
Must have been quite traumatic at the time.

467
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:05,420
No wonder he's submerged the memory.

468
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:08,887
I...

469
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:13,298
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

470
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,734
But it's right for you to raise the questions.

471
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:19,832
You need to be apprised of all changes
the lad went through

472
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:21,968
during his absence.

473
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:25,309
Wouldn't I know whether or not he's my son?

474
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,772
I'm the mother.

475
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:30,808
Which means you're in no position to be objective.

476
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:35,783
You are looking through the prism
of extreme emotion at a boy

477
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:38,456
who has changed from what you remember.

478
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,552
He isn't the same boy that left here.

479
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,756
Just as a boy that goes off to war
and then returns

480
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:44,663
is not the same anymore.

481
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:49,397
And a mother's heart,
driven by intuition and emotion,

482
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,906
sees these changes and rebels,

483
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,940
insists that this isn't your son.

484
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:58,341
Doesn't change the facts.

485
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:06,417
I'm willing to put my theory
to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

486
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:08,621
Are you?

487
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:18,025
<i>It is absolutely outrageous!</i>

488
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,001
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.

489
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:25,131
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

490
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:29,676
This so called doctor paraded me around
my own neighborhood,

491
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:33,078
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

492
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,140
<i>And what was his findings?</i>

493
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:37,481
He found what he expected to find,

494
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:41,155
what you obviously told him he would find.

495
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,690
<i>- Mrs. Collins.
- But that's not...</i>

496
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,419
That's nothing to be embarrassed about.

497
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:48,987
That I was embarrassed is not the issue.

498
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:54,102
The point is that you are wasting time

499
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,333
when you should be looking for my son.

500
00:33:57,406 --> 00:34:00,466
But the report is final, Mrs. Collins.

501
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:04,640
Well, then I want to receive the report,
so I can refute it,

502
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:06,647
before it goes to anyone else.

503
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:07,943
Fine.

504
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:11,115
Yes. Good day.

505
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,894
I'm finished.
Could I go to my room now?

506
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:24,992
Yes.

507
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:36,204
Good night, Mommy.

508
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:39,944
Stop saying that!

509
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,476
Stop saying that!

510
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,652
I'm not your mother!

511
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:51,285
I want my son back.

512
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,989
You're not him.
You're not my son!

513
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:00,060
I want my son back.

514
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,495
I want my son back!

515
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,404
Damn you!

516
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,943
I want my son back!

517
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:44,374
I was wrong to yell at you.

518
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:49,108
You're just a child,

519
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,383
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,

520
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,446
and the hurt you're causing.

521
00:35:55,524 --> 00:36:00,962
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

522
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:05,226
He's all I have.

523
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:11,567
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

524
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,972
you and I,

525
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:19,070
we both know the truth,
don't we?

526
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:23,647
We both know that you're not Walter.

527
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,712
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

528
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,758
so they can find my son.

529
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,591
Please.

530
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,071
We can talk tomorrow.

531
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,053
Hello?

532
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,154
<i>Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?</i>

533
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:10,789
Yes.

534
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,458
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

535
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,901
I'm the pastor over at St. Paul's Presbyterian.

536
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,207
Oh, yes, I've heard your broadcasts.

537
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,798
I'm...

538
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,776
Thank you.

539
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:25,405
<i>Have you read the Times this morning?</i>

540
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:26,607
No.

541
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:31,314
<i>Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish for breakfast,</i>

542
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:34,447
in, say, an hour.
I think we should meet.

543
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:38,286
Hello?

544
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:48,293
"Mysterious case of...

545
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,736
Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

546
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:54,970
Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist,
examined Walter Collins

547
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:56,840
to determine the cause of his loss of weight,

548
00:37:56,912 --> 00:37:59,574
paleness, confusion, and rundown condition

549
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:00,842
noticed since the return of the boy

550
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,407
to his mother last Monday."

551
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,217
Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it?

552
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,315
Noticed since the return of the boy
to his mother.

553
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:13,156
Now, not only does that clearly state
you're the boy's mother,

554
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:17,597
but one could infer from it
that you're somehow responsible for these changes.

555
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,964
And that the police department is concerned

556
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:22,799
for the boy's welfare while he's in your charge.

557
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:25,362
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.

558
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,636
"'I examined the boy quite thoroughly',
Dr. Tarr said,

559
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:32,179
'And it's clear that he has something to tell.

560
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,646
I'm sure that in time...'"

561
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:37,845
time he will give his boyish story
of the entire affair,

562
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,718
but not until he has faith in his listener.

563
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:44,782
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

564
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:49,019
Course of my examination,
I found nothing to dispute the findings

565
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:50,894
of the LAPD.

566
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,328
Why would they do this?

567
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:57,395
To avoid admitting they made a mistake

568
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:59,134
when they brought back the wrong boy.

569
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,870
Of course, anyone reading the newspaper
with half a brain

570
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:04,003
would see through it instantly.

571
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,072
Sadly, that would exclude
about half the readership of the Times.

572
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:13,182
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission in life
to bring to light all the things

573
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:16,816
the LAPD wish none of us ever knew about.

574
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:22,922
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

575
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:27,465
When Chief Davis took over the force
two years ago, he said...

576
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:30,903
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

577
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:33,908
I want them brought in dead, not alive,

578
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:37,810
and I will reprimand any officer
who shows the least mercy to a criminal.

579
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:41,349
He picked 50 of the most violent cops on the force,

580
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:44,977
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

581
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,544
He called them the Gun Squad.

582
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:52,927
<i>No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.</i>

583
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:54,860
Just piles of bodies.

584
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:59,827
<i>Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the hospitals,
bodies by the side of the road.</i>

585
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:04,305
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.

586
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:07,934
The LAPD wanted to wipe out the competition.

587
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,035
Mayor Cryer and half the force are on the take.

588
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:13,240
<i>Gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, you name it.</i>

589
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:16,580
<i>Because once you give people the freedom
to do whatever they want,</i>

590
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:21,453
as the Lord found in the Garden of Eden,
they will do exactly that.

591
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:25,357
This police department does not tolerate dissent,
or contradiction,

592
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:27,827
or even embarrassment.

593
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:32,663
And you are in a position to embarrass them
and they do not like it.

594
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,601
They will do anything in their power
to discredit you.

595
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:39,266
I've seen that happen too many times
to start going blind now.

596
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,400
That's why I wanted to meet you,

597
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:44,309
to let you know what you're
getting yourself into

598
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:47,837
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.

599
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,316
Reverend, I appreciate everything
that you're doing

600
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:53,786
and everything that you said,

601
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,749
but I'm not on a mission.

602
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,850
I just want my son home.

603
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,127
Mrs. Collins, a lot of mothers' sons

604
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:06,361
have been sacrificed to expediency around here.

605
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,733
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

606
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:12,171
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

607
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:22,480
He had two cavities that needed filling.

608
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:25,213
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

609
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,549
And?

610
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:30,285
Your son's upper front teeth were separated
by a small tissue, a diastema.

611
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,850
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

612
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,362
The boy in that room has no such gap.

613
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,694
Can that change with age?
Because that's what they're gonna say.

614
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:39,199
In some cases, yes, it's possible.

615
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,566
But the tissue between Walter's teeth
prevents that from happening.

616
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:46,005
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

617
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,771
and I can tell you right now
that he has never had such an operation.

618
00:41:50,746 --> 00:41:53,214
Would you be willing
to put that officially in writing?

619
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:56,045
Pardon my language, but hell yes.

620
00:41:57,686 --> 00:42:00,951
Sounds like the anesthetic's wearing off.

621
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:04,390
On the other hand,
maybe I'll write that letter first.

622
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:07,519
Give the little fella something to think about.

623
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,403
Well, if it is, he's changed enormously.

624
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:21,374
Do you know who I am?

625
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:22,740
You're a teacher.

626
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:25,974
Yes, but even teachers have names.
What's mine?

627
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,679
I don't remember.

628
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,583
I know you,
but I don't remember your name.

629
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:35,220
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.

630
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:54,298
I didn't say take a seat.
I said take your seat, the one assigned you.

631
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:59,040
You must know where it is,
you've been sitting in it for over a year now.

632
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:10,817
Mrs. Collins, if that's your son,
I'll eat my yardstick.

633
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:14,293
Not only will I put it in writing,
I will testify to it in a court of law

634
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:18,093
or to the President Calvin Coolidge himself
if I have to.

635
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:20,393
Thank you.

636
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,298
I'll see you tonight for the broadcast.

637
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:26,704
Good luck.

638
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:37,179
Quick question, ma'am.

639
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,446
Quick question!

640
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,249
Mrs. Collins.

641
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,583
Hello. My name is Christine Collins.

642
00:43:43,658 --> 00:43:45,853
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

643
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:50,489
On March 10th, my nine-year-old son,
Walter Collins, disappeared.

644
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,294
And a five-month investigation

645
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:56,326
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

646
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:00,772
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

647
00:44:00,876 --> 00:44:02,707
He was not my son.

648
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:04,712
The LAPD made a mistake,

649
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,477
and that is the reason
for the supposed transformation.

650
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:11,018
I have letters from his teachers
and his doctors

651
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:13,486
all confirming that he is not my son.

652
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:17,685
I'm having them reprinted now,
and I'll have them for you tomorrow.

653
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,217
I have given the LAPD every opportunity
to admit their mistake

654
00:44:21,296 --> 00:44:23,560
and renew the search for my son.

655
00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:25,532
Since they have refused to do so,

656
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,501
it has forced me to bring my case public.

657
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,267
And I hope that this now will persuade them
to finish what they started

658
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,002
and bring my son home to me.

659
00:44:35,076 --> 00:44:36,566
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:50,952
Morelli!

661
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,926
I want you to find the Collins woman
and get her here.

662
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:56,225
And, Bill, bring her in the back way.

663
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:57,356
Yes, sir.

664
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:09,867
This way, miss.

665
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:11,970
Why are we going in the back?

666
00:45:12,047 --> 00:45:14,811
Captain's orders.
Front's jammed with reporters.

667
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:22,450
Please, sit down, miss.
Captain Jones'll be right with you.

668
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:26,824
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

669
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:28,190
What'd they do, lose a moose?

670
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:31,494
They need a juvenile living here illegally
deported back to Canada.

671
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:34,967
He's living with his cousin on some ranch
near Riverside, in Wineville.

672
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,094
- You want it?
- I'll take it.

673
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:37,229
Got nothing better to do.

674
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:38,738
You're a prince.

675
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,642
Mrs. Collins.

676
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:45,908
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

677
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:52,314
Sit.

678
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:55,788
Oh, you've caused us
quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

679
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:58,883
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

680
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,484
It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.

681
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:02,029
Oh, no, of course not.

682
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:05,794
You just told the papers we couldn't tell
one boy from another as a compliment

683
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:08,062
for the months we spent working on your case.

684
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:10,502
You trying to make fools out of us?
Is that it? You enjoy this?

685
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,699
Of course not.

686
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,002
I want you to find my son.

687
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,838
You know what your problem is, Mrs. Collins?

688
00:46:15,911 --> 00:46:17,845
You're trying to shirk
your responsibilities as a mother.

689
00:46:17,913 --> 00:46:19,073
What?

690
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:21,206
You enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you?

691
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:23,342
You enjoyed not having to worry
about a young son.

692
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,943
You could go where you wanted,
do whatever you wanted,

693
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:27,818
see anyone you wanted.

694
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,380
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

695
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,688
And now he's an inconvenience to you.

696
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:35,559
And that's why you cooked up this scheme,

697
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,463
to throw him to the state
and get the state to raise him for you.

698
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:40,296
- Isn't that true?
- That is not true!

699
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:42,700
No? Well, even the boy says he's your son.

700
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,068
Why would he say that?

701
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,800
How would he know to do that?

702
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:47,842
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

703
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,275
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

704
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:52,609
But that's how he's been trained, isn't it?

705
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,546
Lying was born in both of you.

706
00:46:54,616 --> 00:46:56,641
You're a liar and a troublemaker and,
if you ask me,

707
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:58,709
you got no business
walking the streets of Los Angeles.

708
00:46:58,787 --> 00:46:59,845
Now wait a minute.

709
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,786
Because either you know you're lying,

710
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:05,587
or you're not capable of knowing
if you're lying or telling the truth.

711
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,184
So, which is it?

712
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:11,156
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

713
00:47:11,232 --> 00:47:13,427
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

714
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,832
I'm not gonna sit here and take this.

715
00:47:14,903 --> 00:47:17,167
You want experts? You want doctors?
I have a few of my own.

716
00:47:17,238 --> 00:47:18,432
Matron.

717
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:26,312
Mrs. Collins, you still insist
that the boy out there is not your son?

718
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:27,712
Yes, I do.

719
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,516
- Please, don't struggle.
- What?

720
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:33,747
- No!
- You'll only hurt yourself.

721
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:35,084
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

722
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:36,714
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.

723
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,917
You are to convey the prisoner

724
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:40,086
to the Los Angeles County
General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

725
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:41,321
What?

726
00:47:41,396 --> 00:47:43,591
You are to make the following entry.

727
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:46,259
Defendant states she's been deceived
by police and others,

728
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:47,824
and that we have given her a boy

729
00:47:47,902 --> 00:47:50,700
and tried to make her think
it is her son when she says it is not.

730
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:53,866
- Take her away.
- No. No, no.

731
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:56,204
Please. Please.

732
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:57,437
Come on, Mrs. Collins.

733
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:59,412
No. No.

734
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:00,641
This way.

735
00:48:04,953 --> 00:48:08,889
<i>Mrs. Collins has been known to us
since about March 10th, 1928,</i>

736
00:48:08,957 --> 00:48:11,755
<i>when she reported her nine-year-old son,
Walter, missing.</i>

737
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:14,488
<i>- The boy was gone until August 1928.
- Okay.</i>

738
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:18,458
<i>Since his return, she has complained
that he is still missing</i>

739
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:21,195
<i>and has made repeated requests
that he be found.</i>

740
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:26,366
<i>She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution
and dislocation from reality.</i>

741
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,935
<i>She may be a threat to herself or others.</i>

742
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:33,707
<i>We recommend that she be conveyed
to the psychopathic ward</i>

743
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:35,477
<i>until her senses can be restored.</i>

744
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,812
Got another code 12.

745
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:37,977
Name?

746
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,111
Collins. Christine.

747
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:40,654
No, no, no, listen, this is a mistake.

748
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:41,984
Certifying officer?

749
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:44,548
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

750
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,617
No, no, please!
Please! The police are trying to punish me...

751
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:48,787
If you keep it up,
I'm gonna have to put you in a straitjacket.

752
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:50,125
Do you want that?

753
00:48:50,198 --> 00:48:51,256
No, ma'am.

754
00:48:51,332 --> 00:48:53,732
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.

755
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:56,430
I'm not mad!

756
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:57,869
Please.

757
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,002
Oh, God.

758
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:02,407
All right.

759
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:08,944
No!

760
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,053
Stop!

761
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,927
Spread your legs.

762
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:28,594
What?

763
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,607
Wider.

764
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:35,302
Oh.

765
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,954
I'm not sick!

766
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,690
Touch me! Touch me!

767
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,225
Inside. This is your room.

768
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:03,395
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

769
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:05,837
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

770
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:07,033
Sorry.

771
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:11,772
My room!
No. No, no, no, this is my room.

772
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:13,205
Can I make a phone call?

773
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:15,249
Phone privileges are earned by good behavior.

774
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:19,047
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

775
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,553
- This is for your own good.
- Help me!

776
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,214
Listen to me.

777
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,121
My room.

778
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:26,888
No, this is my room.

779
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:29,226
Oh, God!

780
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:30,594
My room.

781
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:35,261
No, no, this is my room.

782
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,470
My room.

783
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:45,105
My room! My room!
My room!

784
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,608
My room!

785
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:50,583
They said it was my room!

786
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,598
You have a problem?

787
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:08,067
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.

788
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,894
Hey, listen, could you give me a hand?

789
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:14,772
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

790
00:51:16,244 --> 00:51:18,041
Northcott Ranch, huh?

791
00:51:21,316 --> 00:51:24,615
Oh, yeah, yeah.

792
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:27,783
You're almost there.

793
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:31,382
You just...
You just follow this road west,

794
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:34,087
about two, no, three miles.

795
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:36,687
And then you take that next right.

796
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:40,222
And you stay on that
and it will bring you right to it.

797
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,102
Is something going on out there?

798
00:51:45,173 --> 00:51:46,299
No.

799
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:48,535
Just looking into a juvenile matter.

800
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:50,938
Thanks for your help.

801
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:52,206
Sure.

802
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:40,287
Hello?

803
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,033
Hey!

804
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:30,543
Hey! Hey!

805
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:33,671
Come here!
Come here!

806
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,916
This is the police!

807
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:44,151
I have a warrant for a minor
named Sanford Clark.

808
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:47,820
Open the door or stand aside.

809
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:02,568
Hey! Stop!

810
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,936
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

811
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:10,068
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face
through this floor!

812
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:11,202
Stop it!

813
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:12,337
Fine!

814
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,814
Give me your hands.

815
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:26,053
Come on.
Sit down.

816
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:28,857
Jesus!

817
00:55:30,498 --> 00:55:31,931
What the hell is wrong with you, kid?

818
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,432
Huh?

819
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:35,366
Don't you know assaulting a cop
is against the law?

820
00:55:35,436 --> 00:55:37,631
What difference does it make?

821
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,868
We're just sending you back to Canada, son.

822
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:44,104
It isn't the end of the world.

823
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:45,973
What?

824
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:51,579
Well, you can't stay in the U.S.
as long as you want, pal.

825
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,882
No word from Mrs. Collins?

826
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,324
We haven't heard from her.

827
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:01,588
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

828
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,152
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

829
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,289
Find out what they know.

830
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,423
Absolutely.

831
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,560
<i>And now KGF welcomes
the Reverend Gustav Briegleb</i>

832
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:10,797
<i>of St. Paul's Presbyterian.</i>

833
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:15,274
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

834
00:56:15,343 --> 00:56:18,210
bringing you the Lord's word on Radio KGF.

835
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:19,940
Good evening.

836
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:21,948
I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight,

837
00:56:22,016 --> 00:56:24,314
but apparently she has been delayed.

838
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:28,344
<i>And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,</i>

839
00:56:28,422 --> 00:56:31,050
<i>I'll have to fill in as best I can.</i>

840
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,888
<i>I'm going to tell you what happened</i>

841
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,226
<i>and I'm going to keep on telling you
every night, right here,</i>

842
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:40,358
<i>until somebody does something about it.</i>

843
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:47,232
<i>The Desert Local, train number 45,</i>

844
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:50,607
<i>will be arriving on track two
in five minutes.</i>

845
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:53,304
Hello. I'd like a ticket to Canada.

846
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:55,611
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

847
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:57,651
I don't have anything going that far tonight.

848
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:59,948
The best I can do
is put you on a train to Seattle.

849
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:02,785
From there you can transfer to a local
or drive across the border.

850
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:04,256
That would be fine.

851
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:05,519
Roundtrip?

852
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:06,753
One way.

853
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,260
That'll be $15.

854
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:09,387
Right.

855
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,627
There you go.

856
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:16,226
Thank you. There you go.
Enjoy your trip.

857
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,498
I will.

858
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:37,147
Breakfast is half an hour.

859
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:44,094
Please, miss,
I need to see a doctor in charge.

860
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:45,632
The dining room is down the hall.

861
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,601
The doctor will call for you
when he's ready.

862
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,776
Do you want eggs or oatmeal?

863
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,280
Okay, that's everyone that's here.

864
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:07,719
All right.

865
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,653
You can pull the oatmeal.

866
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,089
Do you want it for tomorrow?

867
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,523
- You know, just dump it.
- All right.

868
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,117
You should eat.

869
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:16,893
Eating is normal.

870
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:19,762
You gotta do everything you can
to look normal.

871
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,301
It's the only chance you got.

872
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:22,529
I'm not hungry.

873
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,867
- Barbara, you have to eat now.
- I'm not hungry.

874
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:27,464
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?

875
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,075
Christine. Christine Collins.

876
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:34,308
Now, finish it all.
I know it's hard, but you gotta try.

877
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:35,679
Oh, boy.

878
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,287
I heard them talking.

879
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:46,417
You're here on code 12?

880
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:48,155
Police action.

881
00:58:48,229 --> 00:58:49,753
I mean, the doctors, the staff,

882
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,161
they figure that
if the police brought you here,

883
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:53,257
there must be a good reason for it.

884
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:55,734
There isn't a good reason for it.

885
00:58:56,237 --> 00:58:59,502
I'm perfectly sane
and I will explain that to them.

886
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:01,265
How?

887
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:06,141
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

888
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:10,047
If you smile too much,
you're delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

889
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:12,881
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

890
00:59:12,953 --> 00:59:17,515
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally withdrawn,
potentially catatonic.

891
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:23,026
You've given this a lot of thought.

892
00:59:23,097 --> 00:59:25,759
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

893
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,000
You're a code 12, so am I.

894
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,265
We're here for the exact same reasons.

895
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:33,465
We both pissed off the cops.

896
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:37,477
Now, you see, you see that lady there?

897
00:59:37,545 --> 00:59:39,979
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

898
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:43,073
When she tried to tell somebody about it,
he brought her here.

899
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,412
I want more juice.

900
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:45,679
And that one?

901
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,084
Put your tray back where it belongs.

902
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:51,386
The police beat the crap out of her brother,
broke both his arms.

903
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:53,893
When she tried to tell the papers...

904
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:57,692
And you?

905
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:01,891
I work nights.

906
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:03,926
Sure.

907
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:08,138
I mean, I work nights.

908
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:11,002
Oh.

909
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,238
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

910
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,371
I'm sorry.

911
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,247
Yeah, well, this one client just kept hitting me
and he wouldn't stop,

912
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:19,377
so I filed a complaint.

913
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,921
And it turns out he was a cop.

914
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,116
Next thing I know, I'm here.

915
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:26,884
But they can't do that.

916
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:28,019
Are you kidding?

917
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:29,619
All right, one more and then that's it.

918
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:32,165
Everybody knows women are fragile.

919
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,501
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

920
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:37,161
Somebody! Help me!

921
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:39,900
Every once in a while they say something
that's a little inconvenient,

922
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,532
they just go fucking nuts.

923
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:42,735
Pardon my French.

924
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,539
- You gotta get those dishes.
- You got it.

925
01:00:44,612 --> 01:00:48,343
If we're insane,
nobody has to listen to us.

926
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,177
I mean, who are you gonna believe,

927
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:54,585
some crazy woman trying to destroy
the integrity of the force,

928
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,418
or a police officer?

929
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,185
Then once they get us in here,
we either shut up and we learn to behave,

930
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:02,923
or we don't go home.

931
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:04,624
Are you all done?

932
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,868
Or we go home like that.

933
01:01:44,572 --> 01:01:48,030
Stop. Stop it.

934
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:51,173
Stop it!
Stop it.

935
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:52,472
Please.

936
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:56,342
Clark.

937
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:58,874
Sanford Clark?

938
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,846
Here.

939
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,881
Paperwork's come through.

940
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,392
You'll be deported back to Canada
day after tomorrow.

941
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,724
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

942
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:12,095
I hope your stay here has convinced you
not to try crossing the border

943
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,929
illegally in the future.

944
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:15,160
Wait!

945
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:20,535
I'd like to talk to the officer
who brought me in.

946
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:22,405
I'm sure he has far more important things...

947
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:24,774
Please. It's important.

948
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,280
Christine Collins.

949
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,016
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

950
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,521
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.

951
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:51,602
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

952
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:53,665
Yes.

953
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:55,641
Really?

954
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,201
I'd think it'd be quite difficult at first.

955
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:03,043
Yes, it was.

956
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:06,917
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

957
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:20,598
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

958
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,632
The Wassermman Test.

959
01:03:23,704 --> 01:03:27,834
They said it was to check for syphilis,
'cause it affects the mind.

960
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:31,742
The idea that someone thinks
you need to be checked for syphilis,

961
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:33,677
does that upset you?

962
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:36,079
No, they said it was standard procedure,
so it did not.

963
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,550
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

964
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:40,484
We have to cover all our bases.

965
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:41,987
I can imagine

966
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,953
that for some people
that would be uncomfortable,

967
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:49,188
but I understood.

968
01:04:07,715 --> 01:04:13,051
According to your file
you believe that the police substituted

969
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:15,246
a fake boy for your son.

970
01:04:15,322 --> 01:04:17,517
No, I didn't say he was a fake boy.

971
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:19,684
He's not my boy.

972
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,193
They brought home the wrong boy.

973
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:23,229
My son is still missing.

974
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:28,299
Well, that's strange,
because I have here a newspaper article

975
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:34,264
with a photo of you at the train station,
welcoming home your son.

976
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:39,339
That is you in the photo, isn't it?

977
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:40,937
Yes.

978
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:42,107
Yeah.

979
01:04:42,816 --> 01:04:43,840
Yes.

980
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:46,852
So, at first he was your son,

981
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:50,152
and now he's not your son.

982
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:54,026
Has this been going on for a long time?

983
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:57,723
People changing, becoming something other
than what they are?

984
01:04:57,798 --> 01:04:59,663
People don't change.

985
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,291
You don't think people change?

986
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:02,460
No, that's not...

987
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:08,370
The police, they're not out to persecute you?

988
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:09,602
No, they're not.

989
01:05:09,676 --> 01:05:10,802
No, they're not.

990
01:05:10,878 --> 01:05:13,972
The police are here to protect you.

991
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,010
Yes.

992
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,683
Really?

993
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:18,809
Yes.

994
01:05:19,887 --> 01:05:24,256
Well, that's odd
because when you were admitted,

995
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:31,460
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

996
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:36,001
So, either the head nurse and the interns
are also conspiring to punish you

997
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,300
or you're changing your story.

998
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:50,641
Do you often have trouble
telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

999
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,144
No.

1000
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:08,058
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

1001
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,126
but the boy has been quite insistent.

1002
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:11,569
It's all right.

1003
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,573
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

1004
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:17,269
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

1005
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:19,642
so this had better be worth it.

1006
01:06:20,214 --> 01:06:21,738
You again, huh?

1007
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:29,582
We'll see.

1008
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:34,419
Well?

1009
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:38,492
This isn't easy, okay?

1010
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:39,554
Yeah?

1011
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:42,966
Driving my ass here in the pouring rain
wasn't easy either.

1012
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:47,402
My cousin is Gordon Northcott.

1013
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:50,068
He owns the ranch where you found me.

1014
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:55,071
He said I could live there
in exchange I watch the place when he's gone,

1015
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:58,110
doing chores and stuff like that.

1016
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:02,451
Said I could stay as long as I wanted to.

1017
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:06,153
I thought that meant I could leave
whenever I wanted.

1018
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:07,284
Mmm.

1019
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,659
You saying that he held you prisoner?

1020
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,890
Bull.

1021
01:07:10,964 --> 01:07:13,831
When I got there,
you were running around free as a jaybird.

1022
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:15,835
Could've left any time you wanted.

1023
01:07:15,903 --> 01:07:16,927
No.

1024
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,766
So, what's this, huh?

1025
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,897
Some kind of story to cover
why you're in the country illegally?

1026
01:07:20,974 --> 01:07:22,100
No, it's nothing like that.

1027
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:23,234
'Cause I don't have time for this, okay?

1028
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,470
Listen to me!
He said...

1029
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:25,807
What?

1030
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:27,608
What did he say?

1031
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:30,980
He said that if I tried to leave,
he'd kill me.

1032
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:34,077
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

1033
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:37,487
what he...
What we did, what he made me do.

1034
01:07:39,993 --> 01:07:41,460
All right.

1035
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:43,962
Let's start at the beginning then.

1036
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:49,694
What'd he make you do?

1037
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:56,474
We killed some kids.

1038
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,805
What?

1039
01:07:57,878 --> 01:08:01,473
Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.
He made me help him.

1040
01:08:01,548 --> 01:08:04,142
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1041
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:06,914
Look, you gotta help me, please.
I'm so scared.

1042
01:08:06,987 --> 01:08:09,979
I don't want to go to hell for killing kids.

1043
01:08:10,057 --> 01:08:11,422
Look.

1044
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:14,324
What kids?
What... What are you talking about?

1045
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:16,919
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1046
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:18,487
Names?

1047
01:08:18,565 --> 01:08:19,589
How many?

1048
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,156
How many kids?

1049
01:08:21,235 --> 01:08:22,600
All together?

1050
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,872
About 20, I guess.

1051
01:08:30,244 --> 01:08:31,643
No, you're lying.

1052
01:08:31,712 --> 01:08:34,078
No! It's true, I swear!

1053
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:35,808
You're gonna tell me you killed 20 kids?

1054
01:08:35,882 --> 01:08:39,340
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1055
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:44,088
I stopped counting after a while.

1056
01:08:47,928 --> 01:08:51,694
Gordon said maybe one or two
may have escaped.

1057
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:56,426
But...

1058
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:57,527
No.

1059
01:08:57,604 --> 01:09:00,437
Nobody can just up and kill 20 kids, okay?

1060
01:09:00,507 --> 01:09:01,701
We did.

1061
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:05,305
We did.

1062
01:09:08,215 --> 01:09:09,273
How?

1063
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:13,751
Most times we'd just have one or two.

1064
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:17,323
Sometimes as many as three.

1065
01:09:19,893 --> 01:09:23,124
<i>I always knew
when we were getting ready to leave.</i>

1066
01:09:25,565 --> 01:09:27,294
<i>Clean up the car.</i>

1067
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:30,565
<i>Make sure the tires were good.</i>

1068
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,302
<i>Check the engine.</i>

1069
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:38,467
<i>'Cause he was afraid
that the car would break down</i>

1070
01:09:40,147 --> 01:09:42,012
<i>and we'd get caught.</i>

1071
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:45,914
<i>My loving baby</i>

1072
01:09:45,986 --> 01:09:49,080
We'd always go a different direction every time.

1073
01:09:50,924 --> 01:09:53,324
Never hit the same part of town twice.

1074
01:09:53,427 --> 01:09:56,828
<i>Sometimes we'd just drive around for hours,</i>

1075
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:58,931
<i>till we found somebody.</i>

1076
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,523
Well, there you are!

1077
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,397
We've been looking for you like mad.

1078
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:03,731
You have?

1079
01:10:03,804 --> 01:10:05,169
Sure thing.

1080
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:08,173
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

1081
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:11,273
And they sent us to come find you.
Now, they're hurt real bad.

1082
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:14,109
The police took them to the hospital,
but they didn't have time to come find you,

1083
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:16,172
so we said that we would do it.

1084
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,849
Now, come on.

1085
01:10:17,918 --> 01:10:20,478
Get in here. Hurry.
All right.

1086
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,887
Listen, we gotta get you to that hospital
so you can see your folks.

1087
01:10:23,957 --> 01:10:27,188
<i>See, a lot of kids won't get in a car alone
with a stranger,</i>

1088
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,591
<i>but when he's got a kid there...</i>

1089
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:30,289
There's a good boy.

1090
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:31,763
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.

1091
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:33,390
<i>that made it easier.</i>

1092
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:34,934
I want you to hold on tight.

1093
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:36,298
<i>They'd look at me and say...</i>

1094
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,632
We've got a long way to go.

1095
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:38,864
<i>"Hey, if he's safe..."</i>

1096
01:10:38,939 --> 01:10:40,099
And we are gonna fly.

1097
01:10:40,173 --> 01:10:42,437
<i>"I guess I will be, too."</i>

1098
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,902
Every time they got in the truck,

1099
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:49,707
I just wanted to die.

1100
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:54,515
As soon as we got back to the ranch,
they went in the coop.

1101
01:10:56,056 --> 01:10:57,387
You boys hungry?

1102
01:10:57,457 --> 01:10:58,549
Huh?

1103
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,456
Watch the door, Sanford!

1104
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,528
Hey! Watch the door!

1105
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,863
What's the matter?

1106
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:06,193
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1107
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,756
Are you worried that I'm gonna hurt you?

1108
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:08,926
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1109
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:10,469
Huh? Come here.

1110
01:11:10,537 --> 01:11:12,528
- No! No! No! No! Please!
- I would never hurt you.

1111
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:15,268
Some days he'd do them right off.

1112
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:20,110
Other days he'd wait,

1113
01:11:21,515 --> 01:11:23,813
pick up a few more,

1114
01:11:23,884 --> 01:11:26,910
until he had about four or five of them.

1115
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,613
Yeah.

1116
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:30,019
- No! No! No!
- No what?

1117
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,182
No what, huh?

1118
01:11:32,526 --> 01:11:33,754
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1119
01:11:33,827 --> 01:11:35,761
Sanford, keep your eye on that door!

1120
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:38,593
No! Please, no! No! No!

1121
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:42,032
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!

1122
01:11:43,904 --> 01:11:46,998
He'd...
He'd sometimes leave

1123
01:11:47,073 --> 01:11:51,407
just one or two of them alive,
barely, anyway.

1124
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:53,706
He'd say,

1125
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,577
"Finish them, San.

1126
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:58,948
Finish them or...
Finish them or I'll finish you."

1127
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:03,086
And I did.

1128
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,619
And I killed them.

1129
01:12:06,693 --> 01:12:07,921
And I did.

1130
01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:09,552
I killed them.

1131
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:11,529
Oh, God, I killed them!

1132
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:15,034
Oh, God! Oh!

1133
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:17,293
Hey.

1134
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,394
Hey.

1135
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:19,564
What?

1136
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,004
Look at me.

1137
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:23,941
These kids.

1138
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:29,348
You think if you saw them again,
you think you might be able to recognize them?

1139
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:31,810
I don't know.

1140
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:33,045
Maybe.

1141
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:36,521
Hey, I haven't updated these
in a while, but still.

1142
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:39,427
Just...

1143
01:12:40,003 --> 01:12:43,234
It should be.
Just go through these, okay?

1144
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:52,445
If you see any you recognize,
just put them down on the table here.

1145
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:32,885
I'm sorry!

1146
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:40,188
Oh, my God.

1147
01:13:40,263 --> 01:13:42,788
I didn't mean to...
He made me.

1148
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,202
Oh, shit.

1149
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:56,645
This one. Look at me.

1150
01:13:59,516 --> 01:14:00,744
You're sure?

1151
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:06,317
I'm sure.

1152
01:14:10,227 --> 01:14:11,285
Jesus Christ.

1153
01:14:11,361 --> 01:14:15,593
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

1154
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:17,332
Jesus Christ.

1155
01:14:18,735 --> 01:14:20,134
Son of a bitch.

1156
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,568
Oh, God.

1157
01:14:26,676 --> 01:14:27,574
Well, he's lying.

1158
01:14:27,644 --> 01:14:29,669
Have you gone soft in the head, Les?

1159
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:30,804
Twenty kids, sir.

1160
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,869
<i>He's playing you.</i>

1161
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:34,678
He knows he's in trouble,
so he's come up with some cock and bull story

1162
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,719
about how he was forced to stay in the country.

1163
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,755
With all due respect, sir, I don't think so.
You didn't see him.

1164
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:41,814
This kid, he's scared half out of his mind.

1165
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:45,019
He picked the Collins kid.
We found him, remember?

1166
01:14:45,095 --> 01:14:46,392
Haven't you been reading the papers?

1167
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:49,326
Or maybe you have, is that it?

1168
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:50,491
<i>Sir, if you'd just listen to me...</i>

1169
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:52,000
I'm sorry, Captain, but he's here again.

1170
01:14:52,068 --> 01:14:53,865
- Who?
- That Reverend Briegleb.

1171
01:14:53,937 --> 01:14:55,768
He's asking about Christine Collins.

1172
01:14:55,839 --> 01:14:56,863
Well, you tell that son of a bitch

1173
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,498
to get the hell off of police property,

1174
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:00,543
or I'll have him arrested
for disturbing the peace.

1175
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,670
I tried. He said he won't leave,
him or his friends.

1176
01:15:03,747 --> 01:15:04,873
What?

1177
01:15:07,183 --> 01:15:08,810
Oh, what the hell!

1178
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:12,111
Jesus!

1179
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:17,885
Oh, Jesus jumped down.

1180
01:15:18,762 --> 01:15:20,059
<i>Captain?</i>

1181
01:15:20,597 --> 01:15:21,586
<i>- Ybarra?
- Yeah.</i>

1182
01:15:21,665 --> 01:15:24,259
Listen to me. You're to do nothing
except get back here.

1183
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:26,268
<i>Sir, departmental policy requires that</i>

1184
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,930
all allegations of homicide
have to be investigated.

1185
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:30,097
These are kids, for Christ sake.

1186
01:15:30,173 --> 01:15:31,765
Departmental policy is what I say it is.

1187
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:35,106
Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass back here
with that kid, you got that?

1188
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:38,079
You don't talk to anybody
and you bring me that kid. You got it?

1189
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:39,308
Nobody!

1190
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:54,820
- Captain Jones.
- Boys.

1191
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:57,332
What the hell have you done
with Christine Collins?

1192
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,595
And don't try and lie your way out of it,

1193
01:15:59,669 --> 01:16:04,163
because several of her neighbors
saw her being driven away in a police car.

1194
01:16:04,474 --> 01:16:06,840
Mrs. Collins has been placed
in protective custody

1195
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,878
following a mental breakdown.

1196
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,608
A what?

1197
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:14,482
She's getting the best treatment available.

1198
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,348
And that will be all.

1199
01:16:19,823 --> 01:16:21,256
Next.

1200
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:22,655
- Go on. Move up.
- For what?

1201
01:16:22,726 --> 01:16:23,715
Medication.

1202
01:16:23,793 --> 01:16:25,852
- Medication for what?
- The kind that's good for you.

1203
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:27,055
Help you relax.

1204
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,188
- Well, I don't want to relax.
- Come on.

1205
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:29,629
- I'm not gonna take something...
- We can force-feed you

1206
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:31,098
- if that's what you want.
- I don't know what it is!

1207
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:32,634
- I don't know what it is. Dr. Steele?
- Take it. Orderly.

1208
01:16:32,702 --> 01:16:33,691
Dr. Steele?

1209
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:34,737
I understand. Come on.

1210
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:36,738
Ladies, keep moving.
Come on.

1211
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:38,433
I don't wanna take anything
that I don't know what it is.

1212
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:40,738
There's nothing wrong with me
that I need medication.

1213
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:43,210
There's nothing wrong with you.

1214
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:47,380
- No, there's nothing wrong.
- No.

1215
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:49,608
- You're fine.
- Yes, I am.

1216
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:55,123
Well, then you shouldn't have any trouble
signing this.

1217
01:16:56,726 --> 01:16:59,217
By signing it,
you certify that you were wrong

1218
01:16:59,329 --> 01:17:02,162
when you stated the boy returned to you
by the police was not your son.

1219
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:04,666
It further stipulates
that the police were right

1220
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:06,668
in sending you here for observation
and it absolves them

1221
01:17:06,736 --> 01:17:09,102
of all responsibility.
Sign it.

1222
01:17:09,172 --> 01:17:10,901
I won't sign that.

1223
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:13,135
I won't sign that.

1224
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:16,076
Well, then your condition is not improved.

1225
01:17:16,146 --> 01:17:20,048
Sign it, and you can be out of here
first thing tomorrow morning.

1226
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:23,379
But I wasn't wrong.

1227
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:25,387
He's not my son.
My son is still missing.

1228
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:28,151
Mrs. Collins, you're becoming agitated.

1229
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:32,285
Yes, I'm, yes...
I'm not signing that, because he's not my son!

1230
01:17:32,362 --> 01:17:33,386
Orderly!

1231
01:17:33,463 --> 01:17:34,862
- He's not my son!
- Orderly!

1232
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:36,330
My son is missing!

1233
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:38,890
- The patient is becoming hysterical!
- No! My son is missing!

1234
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:40,230
See to it she is sedated properly.

1235
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:42,294
- Get her out of here.
- No! No! No!

1236
01:17:42,372 --> 01:17:43,771
- Next!
- No!

1237
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,301
- No, no!
- Orderly, hold on.

1238
01:17:49,913 --> 01:17:51,005
Stop it!

1239
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,674
- No!
- Open your mouth. Open, open your mouth.

1240
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:55,341
- Easy!
- You got her?

1241
01:17:55,418 --> 01:17:56,976
- God!
- Swallow it.

1242
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:58,520
Stop it!

1243
01:18:00,156 --> 01:18:01,248
Move back.

1244
01:18:01,324 --> 01:18:02,757
- You!
- Get her out of here!

1245
01:18:02,826 --> 01:18:04,088
Come on, you got her?

1246
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,560
Stay out of this! This is none of your business!
This is police business!

1247
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:09,189
All of you! You'll stay out of it
if you know what's good for you!

1248
01:18:09,299 --> 01:18:11,529
You'd think you were in enough trouble
with the law already,

1249
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:13,000
being a whore, wouldn't you?

1250
01:18:15,572 --> 01:18:18,473
Attacking a staff member.
Room 18.

1251
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:22,068
No, no! Stop it! No!

1252
01:18:22,378 --> 01:18:24,312
No! No!

1253
01:18:25,648 --> 01:18:27,240
No! Stop it!

1254
01:19:39,923 --> 01:19:41,515
Come on, kid.

1255
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:05,078
I don't know. I'm not sure.
I think so. He was pretty close.

1256
01:20:05,148 --> 01:20:06,445
Excuse me.

1257
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,116
- It's all right, I can take it from here.
- But I got...

1258
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:10,209
We need him for questioning.

1259
01:20:10,286 --> 01:20:11,344
Like I said, it was dark.

1260
01:20:11,421 --> 01:20:12,683
Thanks. Come on.

1261
01:20:13,456 --> 01:20:14,855
Brady, Ross.

1262
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:17,017
You've just been requisitioned for backup.
I'll explain on the way.

1263
01:20:17,093 --> 01:20:18,617
Yes, sir.

1264
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:29,838
I'm not sure. She said she'd had the croup before.
This could be pneumonia.

1265
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:34,942
I keep telling her that,
and she doesn't want to.

1266
01:20:35,078 --> 01:20:36,443
You have to insist.

1267
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:37,979
You shouldn't have done that.

1268
01:20:38,047 --> 01:20:39,412
- Please, let me out!
- Get in there!

1269
01:20:39,482 --> 01:20:40,813
Wanted to.

1270
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:42,748
Felt good.

1271
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:44,511
- Let me out! No! Please! No!
- You got her?

1272
01:20:46,055 --> 01:20:50,424
I lost two babies to back alley doctors.

1273
01:20:51,494 --> 01:20:52,825
No choice.

1274
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,997
Never had the chance to fight for them.

1275
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:01,600
You do.

1276
01:21:02,138 --> 01:21:03,503
Don't stop.

1277
01:21:05,108 --> 01:21:06,336
I won't.

1278
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:14,680
Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.

1279
01:21:17,654 --> 01:21:19,918
That's not exactly language for a lady.

1280
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:22,049
Hell.

1281
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:26,826
There are times that's exactly
the right language to use.

1282
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:29,323
Yeah?

1283
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,425
When you've got nothing left to lose.

1284
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:36,333
You're not supposed to be here!

1285
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:38,100
Mmm. Mmm.

1286
01:22:00,463 --> 01:22:04,024
Stay there. Check the house.
Check the barn.

1287
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,473
It's all clear.

1288
01:22:15,578 --> 01:22:17,409
Clear here.

1289
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,414
Bring me that shovel.

1290
01:22:23,152 --> 01:22:25,484
All right. Let's go.

1291
01:22:30,793 --> 01:22:32,021
Come on.

1292
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:37,393
You're gonna show me.

1293
01:22:43,206 --> 01:22:44,901
Come on. Show me.

1294
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:07,256
This it?

1295
01:23:08,798 --> 01:23:10,095
You sure?

1296
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:11,258
Yeah.

1297
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:15,261
Dig.

1298
01:23:18,107 --> 01:23:22,043
You put them in the ground,
you can take them out of the ground.

1299
01:23:22,979 --> 01:23:24,776
Go on. Dig.

1300
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:27,842
You heard me. Dig.

1301
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:14,426
My God.

1302
01:24:16,632 --> 01:24:18,099
Oh, my God.

1303
01:24:31,647 --> 01:24:33,012
Call it in.

1304
01:24:33,549 --> 01:24:34,641
Get the coroner and every officer

1305
01:24:34,717 --> 01:24:36,912
in a 20-mile radius here inside the hour.

1306
01:24:36,986 --> 01:24:40,285
Then put out an APB
on Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1307
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:43,949
The information's in my car.
Go on.

1308
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,193
You can stop, son.

1309
01:24:56,172 --> 01:24:58,037
You can stop now.
It's over.

1310
01:24:58,107 --> 01:24:59,369
Hey.

1311
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:03,674
We'll take it, we can take it from here.
We can take it from...

1312
01:25:09,018 --> 01:25:12,476
We can take it from here, okay?
It's over.

1313
01:25:18,194 --> 01:25:19,855
It's okay.

1314
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:24,160
It's okay. It's okay.

1315
01:25:24,767 --> 01:25:26,064
It's all over.

1316
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:27,594
Okay?

1317
01:25:29,705 --> 01:25:30,831
File.

1318
01:25:36,245 --> 01:25:37,769
Privacy, please.

1319
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:46,977
I see that you've been refusing medication,
requiring force feeding.

1320
01:25:47,323 --> 01:25:49,291
All right, Michael.
Lunchtime?

1321
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:52,452
Six days, Mrs. Collins,
and no progress.

1322
01:25:53,262 --> 01:25:56,789
We may have to move on
to more strenuous therapies.

1323
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:01,529
Unless you're willing to prove
that you're doing better

1324
01:26:02,972 --> 01:26:04,701
by signing this.

1325
01:26:07,777 --> 01:26:10,610
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

1326
01:26:15,017 --> 01:26:16,541
Room 18.

1327
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:28,022
I want to talk to somebody in charge,
right now!

1328
01:26:28,097 --> 01:26:29,359
Please.

1329
01:26:29,432 --> 01:26:31,457
Who is in charge here?

1330
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:34,829
Open.

1331
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:36,701
I'm the head doctor on duty.

1332
01:26:36,772 --> 01:26:39,036
You're the doctor who locked up
Christine Collins?

1333
01:26:39,108 --> 01:26:40,234
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

1334
01:26:40,309 --> 01:26:41,833
We don't discuss cases
with anyone other than family.

1335
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:44,505
Oh, you'll damn well discuss this one.
Read it.

1336
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,604
Sir.

1337
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:46,909
Read it.

1338
01:26:52,755 --> 01:26:53,813
Stop.

1339
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:03,696
Mrs. Collins, one last time.

1340
01:27:03,766 --> 01:27:07,293
Are you or are you not
prepared to sign that letter?

1341
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:08,598
No.

1342
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:14,366
You're free to leave.

1343
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,872
What?

1344
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:22,740
Your clothes are in the next room.
You can change there.

1345
01:27:23,486 --> 01:27:24,510
In the next room?

1346
01:27:24,587 --> 01:27:26,214
Yes. That's right.

1347
01:27:27,256 --> 01:27:28,553
See to it.

1348
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:34,756
Christ.

1349
01:27:35,264 --> 01:27:36,288
Long as it's not the original.

1350
01:27:36,365 --> 01:27:37,423
No, it's not.

1351
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,899
Here it is.

1352
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:40,799
And who is that?
Is that Baker's file or Larson?

1353
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,098
That's Baker.

1354
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:44,036
He said he wanted...

1355
01:27:44,106 --> 01:27:45,505
Nurse, I wanna see

1356
01:27:45,574 --> 01:27:48,702
every piece of paper you have
on the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

1357
01:27:48,778 --> 01:27:50,769
and I want to see it right now,
do you understand me?

1358
01:27:50,846 --> 01:27:53,474
Every piece.
When will she be coming out?

1359
01:27:54,517 --> 01:27:55,541
Oh, it's just up ahead.

1360
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:56,915
Oh, all right.
Let's...

1361
01:27:56,986 --> 01:27:59,216
Hurricane hits West Palm Beach!

1362
01:27:59,288 --> 01:28:01,756
Babe Ruth hits 53rd home run!

1363
01:28:02,725 --> 01:28:04,716
- Kids found murdered in Riverside!
- There it is.

1364
01:28:04,794 --> 01:28:07,661
Biggest crime in Los Angeles history!

1365
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:09,789
Collins boy assumed dead!

1366
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,491
Read it here!
Read it here!

1367
01:28:18,808 --> 01:28:20,901
Mrs. Collins, I'm so sorry.

1368
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:27,611
Captain, your handling
of the Christine Collins case

1369
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:30,743
has exposed this department to public ridicule.

1370
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:35,153
There is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability.

1371
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:38,491
Sir, nobody could've known
what was happening up at that ranch.

1372
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:41,621
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

1373
01:28:41,697 --> 01:28:43,790
And as for the Collins woman,

1374
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,630
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

1375
01:28:46,769 --> 01:28:47,861
No?

1376
01:28:47,937 --> 01:28:48,904
No.

1377
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:52,463
There were four other photos of missing boys
that looked a lot like him.

1378
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:54,475
The Clark kid could've been mistaken.

1379
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:55,874
Maybe he was.

1380
01:28:55,945 --> 01:28:59,176
Which begs the obvious question.
Who cares?

1381
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:01,675
Sir?

1382
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:04,112
The mayor wants this to go away.

1383
01:29:04,186 --> 01:29:06,279
I want this to go away.

1384
01:29:06,355 --> 01:29:09,847
The way you do that
is to stop insisting that Walter Collins

1385
01:29:09,925 --> 01:29:12,450
is not among those boys
killed up at that goddamn ranch.

1386
01:29:12,528 --> 01:29:15,088
Because if the boy you brought back
is not Walter Collins,

1387
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:18,156
and he's not dead up at that ranch,
then where the hell is he?

1388
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:19,929
People are gonna want to know
why we haven't found him.

1389
01:29:20,002 --> 01:29:22,266
Why we're not doing our job.

1390
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:25,065
But if, on the other hand,

1391
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:29,407
he is, or could be,
among those poor boys killed up in Wineville,

1392
01:29:29,879 --> 01:29:32,211
then the inquiries stop.

1393
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:35,507
It's a momentary embarrassment

1394
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:37,711
you're just gonna have to live with.

1395
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:39,253
Better a short inconvenience

1396
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:42,484
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1397
01:29:42,558 --> 01:29:43,718
Yes, sir.

1398
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,657
The boy's been gone nearly a year.

1399
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,891
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

1400
01:29:48,964 --> 01:29:50,329
Whether he was up at that ranch or not,

1401
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:52,594
the truth is he probably is dead somewhere.

1402
01:29:52,668 --> 01:29:56,729
Better his mother accept that now than later,
don't you think?

1403
01:29:56,805 --> 01:29:58,796
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1404
01:29:58,874 --> 01:30:00,501
That'll be all, Captain.

1405
01:30:02,211 --> 01:30:05,874
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

1406
01:30:06,081 --> 01:30:07,742
Tell county jail we're remanding him for trial.

1407
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:11,684
Wait. I didn't do anything.
I wasn't even here when it happened.

1408
01:30:12,888 --> 01:30:14,219
By pretending to be Walter Collins,

1409
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:17,782
you're interfering in a police investigation
of a kidnapping and murder.

1410
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,852
We can try you as accomplice to that murder
after the fact.

1411
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:22,363
That's too bad.

1412
01:30:22,431 --> 01:30:26,162
County jail is a lot worse
than a juvenile hall or a foster home.

1413
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:27,634
It's a lot worse.

1414
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:32,129
You can't do that.
I'm just a kid.

1415
01:30:34,643 --> 01:30:36,668
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.

1416
01:30:36,745 --> 01:30:39,213
Fifteen.
He's going to jail.

1417
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:43,479
All murderers and their accomplices go to jail.
Everybody knows that.

1418
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:48,384
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

1419
01:30:48,457 --> 01:30:50,982
Wait. I don't want to go to jail.

1420
01:31:01,237 --> 01:31:02,499
Prove it.

1421
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:05,470
I...

1422
01:31:05,608 --> 01:31:09,135
I knew Los Angeles is
where they make the Tom Mix movies.

1423
01:31:09,812 --> 01:31:11,712
I figured if I could meet Tom Mix

1424
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,476
maybe he would let me ride on his horse.

1425
01:31:16,018 --> 01:31:18,578
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

1426
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:24,290
How are you feeling?

1427
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,725
All right.

1428
01:31:26,462 --> 01:31:28,191
The police still have a car outside.

1429
01:31:28,264 --> 01:31:32,132
I guess they're waiting to see
what your next move is going to be.

1430
01:31:33,269 --> 01:31:35,294
- I'm going home.
- And then?

1431
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:37,705
Then, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1432
01:31:37,773 --> 01:31:42,267
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

1433
01:31:43,145 --> 01:31:46,808
I used to always tell him,
"You never start a fight, but you always finish it."

1434
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:50,283
And I didn't start this fight,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1435
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:54,084
Mrs. Collins, right now
you're a sufficiently high profile

1436
01:31:55,157 --> 01:31:58,991
that I think even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open,

1437
01:31:59,461 --> 01:32:01,861
but I have to warn you
that could change very quickly

1438
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,626
if they feel their position threatened.

1439
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:06,497
Very quickly indeed.

1440
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,202
What are they gonna do to me now?

1441
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:13,734
They got nothing.

1442
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:18,269
I'm going home.

1443
01:32:42,004 --> 01:32:43,403
Hi, sis.

1444
01:32:44,139 --> 01:32:45,470
Gordon.

1445
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:48,032
I didn't know you were back in town.

1446
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:50,872
Yeah, I got in a couple of days ago,

1447
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:53,813
figured I'd surprise you.
Is that... Is that okay?

1448
01:32:53,882 --> 01:32:56,908
Yes. Yes, of course.
Of course, come on in.

1449
01:32:59,822 --> 01:33:02,120
Where's that little niece of mine?

1450
01:33:02,191 --> 01:33:04,318
She went into town.

1451
01:33:04,393 --> 01:33:05,883
Should be back this evening.

1452
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:07,155
Uh, Bob's here.

1453
01:33:07,229 --> 01:33:08,287
Oh, good.

1454
01:33:08,364 --> 01:33:10,696
Uh, I was gonna ask
if I could stay on a couple days.

1455
01:33:10,766 --> 01:33:12,131
Staying?

1456
01:33:12,534 --> 01:33:13,660
Yeah.

1457
01:33:13,736 --> 01:33:16,000
Listen, can I use your bathroom?

1458
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:18,062
It's been a long ride
and I could really use a shower.

1459
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,074
- Of course.
- Okay.

1460
01:33:20,843 --> 01:33:22,208
Thank you.

1461
01:33:36,592 --> 01:33:37,820
Is that...

1462
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:41,393
All right, go next door.
I'll call the police. Hurry.

1463
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:47,863
<i>Operator.
How may I connect you?</i>

1464
01:33:48,437 --> 01:33:49,495
He's upstairs, sir.

1465
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:52,335
Go around the other side!
Cut him off!

1466
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:53,466
- Come with me!
- Yes, sir.

1467
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:54,839
Let's go!

1468
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:02,882
Mrs. Collins, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

1469
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:06,580
Mrs. Collins, my deepest condolences on your loss.

1470
01:34:07,256 --> 01:34:08,814
May we come in?

1471
01:34:12,928 --> 01:34:14,828
I appreciate the sentiment,

1472
01:34:14,897 --> 01:34:17,127
but they've yet to find...

1473
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,724
To identify the remains as my son.

1474
01:34:21,904 --> 01:34:24,395
I'm afraid it never gets any easier.

1475
01:34:24,973 --> 01:34:27,134
I lost a daughter to polio five years ago.

1476
01:34:27,209 --> 01:34:29,404
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think,

1477
01:34:29,478 --> 01:34:32,003
"I should mention this to Claudine."

1478
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,446
Then I remember she's not here.

1479
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:38,616
Please, sit.

1480
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:45,493
I've been on the phone all morning

1481
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:48,758
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

1482
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:50,799
They said that they won't let me testify

1483
01:34:50,866 --> 01:34:54,131
at the hearing or call witnesses.
That it won't be necessary.

1484
01:34:54,203 --> 01:34:56,797
I know.
My sources say the police commission

1485
01:34:56,872 --> 01:35:00,968
is going to say that Jones and the LAPD
did absolutely nothing wrong,

1486
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:04,136
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

1487
01:35:04,213 --> 01:35:09,150
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

1488
01:35:12,488 --> 01:35:16,652
Then I guess I would have to hire a lawyer,
file a civil suit.

1489
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:19,393
I went to the best attorney in town,

1490
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:22,294
a man who's sued this city four times and won.

1491
01:35:22,364 --> 01:35:25,333
Unfortunately, we can't afford to really hire him.

1492
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,628
I see.

1493
01:35:26,702 --> 01:35:29,193
Which is why I'm doing this pro bono.

1494
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:33,071
It would be my honor to defend
your honor, Mrs. Collins.

1495
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:34,640
In my 15 years as a lawyer,

1496
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:38,510
I have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have,

1497
01:35:38,747 --> 01:35:41,910
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice.

1498
01:35:42,684 --> 01:35:44,049
Thank you.

1499
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,985
Let me see what's on the shelf.

1500
01:35:46,054 --> 01:35:47,385
I'll look.

1501
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,550
Yes? May I...

1502
01:35:50,626 --> 01:35:51,957
My name is S.S. Hahn,

1503
01:35:52,027 --> 01:35:54,860
and I have a court order for the immediate release
of all women being detained

1504
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:57,865
in this institution
under the designation code 12

1505
01:35:57,933 --> 01:36:01,164
pending a formal inquiry
into the reasons for their detainment.

1506
01:36:01,236 --> 01:36:03,397
I'm sorry, the doctor in charge is not here

1507
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:04,996
- until the morning.
- Madam, let me be clearer.

1508
01:36:05,073 --> 01:36:07,837
Either you will produce the people named
in that court order,

1509
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:11,471
or you will find yourself behind bars,
and I mean without a key.

1510
01:36:11,547 --> 01:36:14,675
- I can't authorize you...
- Madam, stand aside.

1511
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:25,718
Can I see her now?

1512
01:36:25,794 --> 01:36:27,819
- Sure. Absolutely.
- How does she look?

1513
01:36:53,455 --> 01:36:55,423
All right, fellas, step back.
Let's give him room.

1514
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:56,514
Here he is.

1515
01:36:56,592 --> 01:36:58,583
Mr. Northcott, any comment on your arrest?

1516
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,820
Mr. Northcott, how are you feeling?

1517
01:36:59,895 --> 01:37:01,556
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

1518
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:04,155
I've been on a little vacation,
as some of you know.

1519
01:37:04,232 --> 01:37:06,928
It was a really pleasant vacation.

1520
01:37:07,002 --> 01:37:10,233
The police have certainly provided me
with a lot of amusement.

1521
01:37:10,305 --> 01:37:11,738
How long you been in hiding?

1522
01:37:11,807 --> 01:37:13,069
How did you avoid capture?

1523
01:37:13,141 --> 01:37:14,403
Easy, easy.
That's far enough.

1524
01:37:14,476 --> 01:37:16,171
Well, I didn't, did I?

1525
01:37:16,244 --> 01:37:17,336
One more shot!

1526
01:37:17,412 --> 01:37:19,380
Have you seen your picture in the paper?

1527
01:37:19,448 --> 01:37:22,679
Didn't know anybody wanted me
until just recently.

1528
01:37:22,751 --> 01:37:24,343
Didn't even try.

1529
01:37:24,953 --> 01:37:28,013
My luggage still has my initials on it, fellas.

1530
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:30,217
Did you know why the police were after you?

1531
01:37:30,292 --> 01:37:33,193
No, but I figured it'd be a good idea
if I were to just stay out of it.

1532
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:34,285
Any remorse, sir?

1533
01:37:34,363 --> 01:37:39,062
Do you have anything to say
to the parents of the children you murdered?

1534
01:37:39,134 --> 01:37:40,829
No comment.

1535
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:41,994
One more shot, this way!

1536
01:37:43,605 --> 01:37:46,267
Mayor Cryer.
This is unexpected.

1537
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:48,666
So was this.

1538
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:52,180
Subpoenas, requests for depositions, interrogatories.

1539
01:37:52,247 --> 01:37:55,842
All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his new client,
Christine Collins.

1540
01:37:56,785 --> 01:37:58,343
You don't have to look them over
too closely, Chief.

1541
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:01,184
Your own copies should be coming any time now.

1542
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:03,690
The city council has also agreed
to look into this,

1543
01:38:03,759 --> 01:38:04,817
starting immediately.

1544
01:38:04,893 --> 01:38:05,951
God damn it!

1545
01:38:06,028 --> 01:38:08,758
I thought this was supposed to go away.

1546
01:38:09,398 --> 01:38:10,626
This is an election year.

1547
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:12,189
I can't afford this kind of press.

1548
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:15,498
It is going away, sir.
I've instructed Captain Jones to deal with it.

1549
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:17,128
I'm afraid, falling on his sword

1550
01:38:17,205 --> 01:38:21,107
and saying he made a mistake
isn't going to be good enough, Chief.

1551
01:38:21,176 --> 01:38:24,634
If we take him out of the picture
for a while,

1552
01:38:24,713 --> 01:38:28,513
just might help calm things down
until the hearing's finished.

1553
01:38:46,168 --> 01:38:48,466
- What is happening?
- Didn't you hear?

1554
01:38:48,537 --> 01:38:50,300
It's the biggest protest I've ever seen.

1555
01:38:50,372 --> 01:38:51,634
- Protest?
- Yeah.

1556
01:38:51,707 --> 01:38:54,904
Over the Collins broad,
if you can believe that.

1557
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:07,649
We want justice! We want justice!

1558
01:39:10,058 --> 01:39:11,650
Oh, my!

1559
01:39:18,133 --> 01:39:20,101
Mr. Harris.

1560
01:39:20,168 --> 01:39:23,467
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mrs. Collins.

1561
01:39:24,706 --> 01:39:26,571
Boy, does he ever.

1562
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:46,453
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?</i>

1563
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:51,090
There are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before.

1564
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:54,863
Therefore, I ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind.

1565
01:39:54,936 --> 01:39:56,426
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

1566
01:39:56,505 --> 01:40:00,407
We are all here because we want to know
the real facts in this case.

1567
01:40:00,475 --> 01:40:04,605
And everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.

1568
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,580
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any members
of the police commission.

1569
01:40:11,086 --> 01:40:14,249
Are there any members
of the police department in the room?

1570
01:40:14,322 --> 01:40:16,187
Is Chief Davis here?

1571
01:40:17,592 --> 01:40:19,184
Is Captain Jones here?

1572
01:40:20,962 --> 01:40:22,361
Is there anybody here representing the police?

1573
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:26,628
Mrs. Collins, could you come across the street
with me for just a moment?

1574
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:28,896
There's something I think you should see.

1575
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,995
Well, I hate to call a recess
before we've even started,

1576
01:40:31,072 --> 01:40:32,596
but I think a few phone calls are in order.

1577
01:40:36,845 --> 01:40:39,746
The police decided it'd be best
to keep this off the main docket

1578
01:40:39,848 --> 01:40:44,080
in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos
we have across the street.

1579
01:40:56,731 --> 01:40:59,700
Mrs. Collins.
I'm Leanne Clay.

1580
01:41:00,502 --> 01:41:02,766
- This is my husband, John.
- Hi.

1581
01:41:03,672 --> 01:41:06,698
I just wanted to pass along my sympathies.

1582
01:41:06,975 --> 01:41:09,102
What we went through
waiting to hear anything

1583
01:41:09,177 --> 01:41:13,307
about our son David was bad enough,
now this.

1584
01:41:14,249 --> 01:41:18,208
But what the police did to you,
there was no call for that.

1585
01:41:18,286 --> 01:41:19,844
No call at all.

1586
01:41:22,858 --> 01:41:24,416
All rise.

1587
01:41:33,168 --> 01:41:35,193
- Please, be seated.
- Bailiff.

1588
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:49,644
Oh, hey.

1589
01:41:51,853 --> 01:41:53,980
I saw you in the papers.

1590
01:41:54,055 --> 01:41:57,923
You got a lot of moxie,
standing up to the police like that.

1591
01:42:03,131 --> 01:42:05,065
The defendant will please rise.

1592
01:42:10,705 --> 01:42:12,798
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1593
01:42:12,874 --> 01:42:17,038
you've been charged with three counts of murder
in the first degree,

1594
01:42:17,112 --> 01:42:21,811
with an additional 17 counts under review
by the district attorney's office.

1595
01:42:21,883 --> 01:42:23,510
How do you plea?

1596
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,047
Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.

1597
01:42:30,825 --> 01:42:32,986
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.

1598
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:42,502
In light of the defendant's penchant
for international travel, no bail will be set.

1599
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:45,164
This court will hear preliminary motions
by tomorrow morning.

1600
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,708
The boy, Walter Collins,

1601
01:42:47,776 --> 01:42:50,540
was reported as missing,
March 10, 1928.

1602
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:53,974
We then instituted a nationwide search.

1603
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:57,985
On August 18th, we received a cable
indicating that a boy

1604
01:42:58,053 --> 01:43:01,489
matching his description
was found in DeKalb, Illinois.

1605
01:43:01,556 --> 01:43:05,583
Upon questioning,
he admitted to being Walter Collins.

1606
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:10,620
We then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to California.

1607
01:43:10,865 --> 01:43:13,333
Where Mrs. Collins told you
the boy was not her son.

1608
01:43:13,401 --> 01:43:15,164
Yes. She denied his identity

1609
01:43:15,236 --> 01:43:18,228
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary.

1610
01:43:18,306 --> 01:43:21,400
But, as subsequent events have demonstrated,

1611
01:43:21,509 --> 01:43:23,170
she was correct.

1612
01:43:24,412 --> 01:43:26,277
So, what prompted you to send her

1613
01:43:26,348 --> 01:43:27,975
for psychological evaluation?

1614
01:43:28,049 --> 01:43:29,778
Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy

1615
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:32,376
was not relevant to my decision.

1616
01:43:32,454 --> 01:43:34,615
Throughout this period,
she acted strangely.

1617
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:38,216
She was often cool
and aloof and unemotional,

1618
01:43:38,293 --> 01:43:41,956
especially when confronted with the boy
we found in DeKalb

1619
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:44,089
and in our subsequent conversation.

1620
01:43:44,165 --> 01:43:47,030
It was because of her disturbing behavior

1621
01:43:47,835 --> 01:43:51,534
that I submitted her for observation

1622
01:43:51,606 --> 01:43:54,404
to the psychopathic ward
of Los Angeles County General Hospital.

1623
01:43:54,476 --> 01:43:55,773
Just like that.

1624
01:43:55,844 --> 01:43:58,039
You snap your fingers and an innocent woman

1625
01:43:58,113 --> 01:43:59,808
is thrown into the psycho ward!

1626
01:43:59,881 --> 01:44:03,214
- She wasn't thrown.
- Every family in this state is in grave danger

1627
01:44:03,284 --> 01:44:06,412
when a police captain
can take a woman into his office

1628
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:07,818
and five minutes later

1629
01:44:07,889 --> 01:44:10,619
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority!

1630
01:44:10,692 --> 01:44:12,091
She wasn't thrown.

1631
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,493
She wasn't thrown!
She wasn't thrown!

1632
01:44:16,164 --> 01:44:18,064
What was that, Captain?

1633
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:20,861
She wasn't thrown.
She was escorted.

1634
01:44:24,606 --> 01:44:28,133
Escorted, thrown,
the verb doesn't matter, Captain.

1635
01:44:28,209 --> 01:44:32,441
What does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant.

1636
01:44:32,514 --> 01:44:34,448
I am holding a carbon copy

1637
01:44:34,516 --> 01:44:37,644
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case

1638
01:44:37,719 --> 01:44:41,155
of the State of California
v. Christine Collins.

1639
01:44:41,222 --> 01:44:42,689
Who signed the affidavit?

1640
01:44:42,757 --> 01:44:43,849
I did.

1641
01:44:43,925 --> 01:44:46,553
Well, now, let me see
if I have this correct,

1642
01:44:46,628 --> 01:44:50,223
a woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward
without a warrant,

1643
01:44:50,298 --> 01:44:52,459
because no warrant existed.

1644
01:44:52,534 --> 01:44:55,094
And when it was finally written
several days later,

1645
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:57,536
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge

1646
01:44:57,605 --> 01:45:00,369
because she was already in the asylum!

1647
01:45:02,043 --> 01:45:03,135
Is this correct, Captain?

1648
01:45:03,211 --> 01:45:04,473
Technically, yes.

1649
01:45:04,546 --> 01:45:07,572
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing...

1650
01:45:07,649 --> 01:45:09,480
We were dealing with an extraordinary situation.

1651
01:45:09,551 --> 01:45:12,247
Now, is it our fault that we were being deceived

1652
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,118
by a boy who claimed to be Walter Collins?
No.

1653
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:18,882
In light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior,

1654
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,554
who wouldn't begin to think
that there was something the matter with her?

1655
01:45:21,629 --> 01:45:22,653
Because she questioned you?

1656
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,925
No, because she wouldn't listen!

1657
01:45:24,999 --> 01:45:26,796
Because she insisted on being obstinate!

1658
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:30,065
Because she tried to take matters
into her own hand,

1659
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:31,934
best left to qualified officers!

1660
01:45:32,006 --> 01:45:33,701
Because once civil disobedience starts...

1661
01:45:33,775 --> 01:45:35,834
Because she was fighting
for the life of her son!

1662
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:37,901
A boy who may have still been alive

1663
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,643
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong!

1664
01:45:45,386 --> 01:45:46,944
And in the end

1665
01:45:48,456 --> 01:45:51,186
that's what happened, isn't it?

1666
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:54,750
At some point,
while all this was going on,

1667
01:45:56,931 --> 01:45:59,593
Walter Collins was brutally murdered,

1668
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:02,968
along with as many as 19 other boys

1669
01:46:04,772 --> 01:46:07,434
at the Northcott Ranch in Wineville.

1670
01:46:09,244 --> 01:46:11,405
Is that correct, Captain?

1671
01:46:13,047 --> 01:46:14,537
Yes, it is.

1672
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:16,910
It's a travesty.

1673
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:24,421
No further questions.

1674
01:46:41,809 --> 01:46:43,800
<i>Train number 14,
now boarding on track...</i>

1675
01:46:43,878 --> 01:46:47,746
So, after much effort,
we were able to identify this boy,

1676
01:46:47,815 --> 01:46:50,375
who's been responsible
for so much trouble lately,

1677
01:46:50,451 --> 01:46:53,318
as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1678
01:46:54,122 --> 01:46:57,387
Between this, and the arrest of the man
suspected of murdering

1679
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:59,187
the real Walter Collins,

1680
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:02,525
we've cleared up two of the biggest mysteries
in the history of Los Angeles.

1681
01:47:02,597 --> 01:47:04,792
I hope you gentlemen of the press will give

1682
01:47:04,866 --> 01:47:06,925
as much space to the good things we do

1683
01:47:07,001 --> 01:47:09,561
as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions.

1684
01:47:09,637 --> 01:47:11,468
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you

1685
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:14,599
to the boy's real mother,
Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

1686
01:47:16,044 --> 01:47:17,511
Arthur.

1687
01:47:17,612 --> 01:47:19,102
I hope he wasn't too much trouble for you.

1688
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,977
Oh, no, not at all.

1689
01:47:21,049 --> 01:47:23,244
How about a photograph, fellas?

1690
01:47:26,321 --> 01:47:27,720
One more.

1691
01:47:28,289 --> 01:47:29,722
Mrs. Hutchins,

1692
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:33,124
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was staying with,
wanted him to have these.

1693
01:47:33,194 --> 01:47:34,684
They're the clothes she let him wear.

1694
01:47:34,762 --> 01:47:36,559
Well, thank you.

1695
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:38,394
Isn't that nice, Arthur?

1696
01:47:38,466 --> 01:47:40,832
Tell the nice officer,
"Thank you."

1697
01:47:40,902 --> 01:47:43,894
I don't want them.
Give them to somebody else.

1698
01:47:43,972 --> 01:47:45,599
Precocious little fellow, isn't he?

1699
01:47:45,673 --> 01:47:47,971
It's not my fault.
It's the police.

1700
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:51,671
They said I was Walter Collins, not me!
It wasn't my idea!

1701
01:47:51,746 --> 01:47:53,213
- Not my idea!
- Get...

1702
01:47:53,281 --> 01:47:55,715
Yeah. Go blame the police
for your own mistakes.

1703
01:47:55,783 --> 01:47:57,944
We've seen a lot of that lately,
haven't we?

1704
01:47:58,019 --> 01:48:00,954
Take care now, Arthur!
Safe travels.

1705
01:48:02,123 --> 01:48:04,353
All right, fellas, that's it for today.

1706
01:48:04,425 --> 01:48:06,154
Sir, sir!
What did the boy mean by that?

1707
01:48:06,427 --> 01:48:09,954
It was March 10th,
and I came home from work,

1708
01:48:10,031 --> 01:48:12,898
and my nine-year-old son, Walter,
was gone.

1709
01:48:12,967 --> 01:48:16,698
Captain Jones was acting on information
he believed to be correct.

1710
01:48:16,771 --> 01:48:20,400
Walter Collins had a diastema,
also known as a diastema.

1711
01:48:20,475 --> 01:48:21,999
That child was never in my classroom.

1712
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:23,634
I can certainly attest to that.

1713
01:48:23,711 --> 01:48:27,078
We rely on our good friends
in the police department

1714
01:48:27,148 --> 01:48:30,208
to point to us those people who exhibit behavior

1715
01:48:30,285 --> 01:48:33,015
which is socially unacceptable.

1716
01:48:33,087 --> 01:48:37,922
About four inches shorter
than the last mark of Walter.

1717
01:48:38,793 --> 01:48:41,318
Well, some of these pictures show

1718
01:48:41,396 --> 01:48:44,058
what Sanford Clark told me,

1719
01:48:44,132 --> 01:48:47,727
that he did in fact help
in the murder of these children.

1720
01:48:47,802 --> 01:48:49,497
Thank you, Detective.

1721
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:50,798
Gentlemen of the jury,

1722
01:48:50,872 --> 01:48:53,636
I ask you to take a good look at these images.

1723
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:56,268
They establish beyond any reasonable doubt

1724
01:48:56,344 --> 01:49:00,110
the circumstances and the nature
of these heinous crimes.

1725
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:13,224
I'm in here, Reverend.

1726
01:49:21,336 --> 01:49:23,463
When Walter was here,
I used to walk by his room

1727
01:49:23,538 --> 01:49:25,699
when he was sleeping.

1728
01:49:25,773 --> 01:49:29,766
And even though I couldn't see him
or hear him,

1729
01:49:29,844 --> 01:49:31,573
I could feel him.

1730
01:49:33,815 --> 01:49:36,545
That's why I don't think Walter's dead.

1731
01:49:37,885 --> 01:49:39,682
I can still feel him.

1732
01:49:42,323 --> 01:49:44,291
- Mrs. Collins...
- No.

1733
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:46,554
I know what the police said.

1734
01:49:47,061 --> 01:49:49,621
But that place and the remains,

1735
01:49:51,499 --> 01:49:54,024
they couldn't be properly identified.

1736
01:49:55,036 --> 01:49:59,370
And maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked Walter's picture.

1737
01:50:00,241 --> 01:50:03,642
I understand you don't want to accept this.

1738
01:50:03,711 --> 01:50:05,372
What mother would?

1739
01:50:08,683 --> 01:50:12,175
But I think it's time for you to move on

1740
01:50:12,286 --> 01:50:14,652
and start over for yourself.

1741
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:18,324
Your son would want you to move on.

1742
01:50:20,495 --> 01:50:22,725
Maybe.

1743
01:50:22,797 --> 01:50:26,096
Maybe he'd want me to keep looking for him.

1744
01:50:26,167 --> 01:50:28,692
Maybe he's somewhere waiting for me.

1745
01:50:30,571 --> 01:50:32,801
I believe he is waiting, ma'am.

1746
01:50:34,308 --> 01:50:36,105
He's waiting in that place

1747
01:50:36,177 --> 01:50:40,204
where we'll all go someday
to be reunited with our loved ones.

1748
01:50:40,281 --> 01:50:45,378
And on that day, he'll know from front to back,
end to end,

1749
01:50:45,453 --> 01:50:48,980
heart to soul, that you did everything
you could, Mrs. Collins.

1750
01:50:50,358 --> 01:50:51,723
Everything.

1751
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:57,325
We should go, ma'am.

1752
01:50:57,398 --> 01:50:58,763
One minute.

1753
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,151
This meeting will now come to order.

1754
01:51:29,163 --> 01:51:32,189
This committee has now heard all of the testimony,

1755
01:51:32,266 --> 01:51:35,235
and, in light of the facts presented,

1756
01:51:35,336 --> 01:51:38,169
we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones

1757
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:39,706
be made permanent.

1758
01:51:44,545 --> 01:51:47,605
Order! Please. Please.

1759
01:51:48,749 --> 01:51:50,740
Mr. Foreman,

1760
01:51:50,818 --> 01:51:53,309
has the jury reached a verdict?

1761
01:51:53,387 --> 01:51:55,150
We have, Your Honor.

1762
01:51:56,424 --> 01:51:58,654
Will the defendant please rise?

1763
01:52:01,262 --> 01:52:05,062
Second, that steps be taken
to investigate a change

1764
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:08,260
in the prevailing laws
and procedures by which a citizen

1765
01:52:08,336 --> 01:52:11,794
of this city can be subjected to incarceration

1766
01:52:11,873 --> 01:52:13,932
in the county's mental facilities.

1767
01:52:21,115 --> 01:52:23,106
You may read the verdict.

1768
01:52:23,818 --> 01:52:26,685
"We the jury find the defendant,
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1769
01:52:26,754 --> 01:52:29,314
guilty on all counts of murder
in the first degree."

1770
01:52:34,095 --> 01:52:38,361
Finally, restoration of public confidence
in the police department

1771
01:52:38,432 --> 01:52:40,559
can only be achieved

1772
01:52:40,668 --> 01:52:43,899
by the removal of its chief of police,

1773
01:52:44,005 --> 01:52:46,030
and this committee so recommends.

1774
01:52:46,107 --> 01:52:47,335
This hearing is concluded.

1775
01:53:08,162 --> 01:53:12,462
Does the defendant wish to make a statement
before judgment is passed?

1776
01:53:13,601 --> 01:53:16,365
I want to make it real clear

1777
01:53:16,437 --> 01:53:19,873
that I never once got a fair shake from you,

1778
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:21,704
Your Honor,

1779
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:25,111
or from this court.

1780
01:53:29,517 --> 01:53:32,680
The only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her.

1781
01:53:35,089 --> 01:53:38,149
'Cause she's the only one
who never badmouthed me to the press.

1782
01:53:38,225 --> 01:53:39,658
She's the only one who understands

1783
01:53:39,727 --> 01:53:41,251
what it is to be framed by the police

1784
01:53:41,329 --> 01:53:43,627
- for something you didn't do.
- All right, that's enough.

1785
01:53:43,698 --> 01:53:46,292
And then to just be thrown in the hole,

1786
01:53:46,367 --> 01:53:49,359
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten

1787
01:53:49,437 --> 01:53:51,166
- and fade away, isn't that right?
- Gordon!

1788
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:52,364
- Counsel!
- Isn't it?

1789
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,840
I never killed your boy, Mrs. Collins.

1790
01:53:54,909 --> 01:53:56,672
- Counsel, that's enough!
- I would never do that.

1791
01:53:56,744 --> 01:53:57,802
I would never hurt Walter.

1792
01:53:57,878 --> 01:53:58,902
Counsel, get control of your client

1793
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:00,038
or I'll have him bound and gagged!

1794
01:54:00,114 --> 01:54:01,604
He's an angel.

1795
01:54:01,682 --> 01:54:04,412
- Come on, Gordon.
- Get off of me!

1796
01:54:04,485 --> 01:54:05,975
Now get down.

1797
01:54:08,723 --> 01:54:10,816
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1798
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,758
it is the judgment of this court

1799
01:54:14,829 --> 01:54:17,127
that you be conveyed to San Quentin Prison,

1800
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:20,497
where you'll be held in solitary confinement
for a period of two years,

1801
01:54:20,568 --> 01:54:24,163
until October 2, 1930.

1802
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:29,573
On that date,
you will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1803
01:54:32,446 --> 01:54:34,505
May God have mercy on your soul.

1804
01:55:48,589 --> 01:55:50,079
Is it all right if I have a 10-minute break?

1805
01:55:50,157 --> 01:55:51,454
Of course.

1806
01:55:54,028 --> 01:55:55,393
You know,

1807
01:55:56,497 --> 01:55:58,431
one of these days
you might actually consider taking

1808
01:55:58,499 --> 01:56:00,023
one of these 10-minute breaks.

1809
01:56:00,101 --> 01:56:01,864
It might be good for you.

1810
01:56:01,936 --> 01:56:03,267
We'll see.

1811
01:56:06,107 --> 01:56:08,132
This is Christine Collins.

1812
01:56:08,209 --> 01:56:10,143
I called yesterday.

1813
01:56:10,211 --> 01:56:12,805
I was wondering if you had a chance
to look through the files

1814
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,543
and see if there was a match to my son,
Walter Collins.

1815
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:19,143
I see.

1816
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:20,482
Well, if it's all right with you,

1817
01:56:20,554 --> 01:56:23,318
I'll call back in a month.
Thank you very much.

1818
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:25,585
- Mrs. Collins.
- I was just...

1819
01:56:25,659 --> 01:56:27,058
Yes, I know.

1820
01:56:28,195 --> 01:56:31,062
In fact, that's why I wanted to see you.

1821
01:56:31,132 --> 01:56:32,963
It's about Walter.
We had a...

1822
01:56:34,001 --> 01:56:36,765
Well, we received a very strange telegram.

1823
01:56:37,671 --> 01:56:38,933
From who?

1824
01:56:39,006 --> 01:56:40,974
Gordon Northcott.

1825
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:42,941
He's asked to see you.

1826
01:56:43,477 --> 01:56:44,535
Why?

1827
01:56:45,613 --> 01:56:47,547
He said he knows
you're still looking for your son,

1828
01:56:47,615 --> 01:56:49,515
and before he dies...

1829
01:56:52,987 --> 01:56:56,388
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

1830
01:56:56,457 --> 01:57:00,052
Christine, he's willing to finally admit
that he did it.

1831
01:57:00,895 --> 01:57:03,363
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

1832
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:05,955
then he'll tell you the truth,
to your face

1833
01:57:06,033 --> 01:57:08,558
so that you can get on with your life

1834
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:11,137
and have some peace.

1835
01:57:11,906 --> 01:57:13,430
<i>As you know, he's set to be executed</i>

1836
01:57:13,507 --> 01:57:15,771
<i>the day after tomorrow at San Quentin,</i>

1837
01:57:15,843 --> 01:57:19,006
<i>so you don't have a lot of time.</i>

1838
01:57:20,014 --> 01:57:23,780
<i>It took me most of the morning
to make all the arrangements.</i>

1839
01:57:24,084 --> 01:57:25,915
<i>Turns out,
you're the first woman in 30 years</i>

1840
01:57:25,986 --> 01:57:28,921
<i>the state has allowed
to visit a serial killer</i>

1841
01:57:28,989 --> 01:57:31,082
<i>on the eve of his execution.</i>

1842
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:53,007
You'll be all right, ma'am?

1843
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,514
- Yes.
- We're right at the door.

1844
01:57:58,619 --> 01:58:00,018
Twenty minutes.

1845
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:07,725
Don't suppose you got a cigarette?

1846
01:58:10,264 --> 01:58:13,165
Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.

1847
01:58:13,367 --> 01:58:15,062
You said that if I did,

1848
01:58:15,135 --> 01:58:17,831
you would tell me the truth about my son.

1849
01:58:19,139 --> 01:58:20,538
Yeah.

1850
01:58:22,076 --> 01:58:24,704
You're right.
I did say that.

1851
01:58:24,778 --> 01:58:28,305
But see, the thing is,

1852
01:58:28,382 --> 01:58:31,818
I didn't really think that you would come.

1853
01:58:31,886 --> 01:58:33,251
And now.

1854
01:58:34,421 --> 01:58:36,548
And now...
And now what?

1855
01:58:36,757 --> 01:58:39,055
I just didn't expect that you'd...

1856
01:58:41,061 --> 01:58:43,029
I don't wanna see you.

1857
01:58:43,497 --> 01:58:45,556
You don't wanna see me?

1858
01:58:45,633 --> 01:58:48,101
No. See, I can't do this.

1859
01:58:48,168 --> 01:58:50,159
I don't wanna talk to you.
I can't talk to you right now,

1860
01:58:50,237 --> 01:58:52,228
not with what they're gonna be doing
to me tomorrow.

1861
01:58:52,306 --> 01:58:55,639
It's one thing, Mrs. Collins,
to send a telegram,

1862
01:58:55,709 --> 01:58:57,176
that is really easy.

1863
01:58:57,244 --> 01:59:01,738
But when it's here, right now,
in person, you know,

1864
01:59:01,815 --> 01:59:03,214
I just, I can't...

1865
01:59:03,284 --> 01:59:05,309
I can't tell you what you want to hear,
Mrs. Collins.

1866
01:59:05,386 --> 01:59:06,444
And why not?

1867
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:10,149
Because I don't want to go to hell
with a lie on my lips.

1868
01:59:10,224 --> 01:59:12,317
See, I did my penance,

1869
01:59:12,393 --> 01:59:15,692
and I asked God to forgive me and he did,
so far as I know.

1870
01:59:15,763 --> 01:59:18,391
And I have been really good ever since.

1871
01:59:18,465 --> 01:59:23,232
But if I lie now,
if I commit any sins right now,

1872
01:59:23,304 --> 01:59:25,204
I'm out of time here,

1873
01:59:25,272 --> 01:59:26,671
and I won't be forgiven again.

1874
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:29,106
And I'll tell you one thing,
I am not going to hell.

1875
01:59:31,512 --> 01:59:33,412
I'm not...

1876
01:59:40,321 --> 01:59:43,085
Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.

1877
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,731
Mr. Northcott, please look at me.

1878
01:59:56,637 --> 01:59:58,969
Mr. Northcott, please look at me.

1879
02:00:05,879 --> 02:00:07,642
Did you kill my son?

1880
02:00:12,486 --> 02:00:14,249
Did you kill my son?

1881
02:00:15,089 --> 02:00:16,556
I don't know what you're talking about.

1882
02:00:16,623 --> 02:00:18,284
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- Hmm.

1883
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:19,519
Did you kill my son?

1884
02:00:21,428 --> 02:00:24,329
I told you,
I don't wanna talk to you right now.

1885
02:00:24,898 --> 02:00:27,366
Did you kill my son?

1886
02:00:27,434 --> 02:00:28,992
Did you kill my son?

1887
02:00:29,069 --> 02:00:30,127
- Did you kill my son?
- Hmm.

1888
02:00:30,204 --> 02:00:31,569
- Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1889
02:00:31,638 --> 02:00:32,832
You don't know?
You don't remember?

1890
02:00:32,906 --> 02:00:34,271
- Did you kill my son?
- Oh, no.

1891
02:00:34,341 --> 02:00:37,071
Answer me!
You answer me! You answer me!

1892
02:00:37,144 --> 02:00:39,169
- I don't know their names.
- Did you kill my son? Yes...

1893
02:00:39,246 --> 02:00:40,474
You better get off of me.

1894
02:00:40,547 --> 02:00:41,912
- Or what?
- Hmm.

1895
02:00:41,982 --> 02:00:43,381
- Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1896
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:44,644
Did you kill...

1897
02:00:44,718 --> 02:00:46,015
Did you kill my son?

1898
02:00:46,086 --> 02:00:47,348
- You know his name!
- Oh, I don't. No.

1899
02:00:47,421 --> 02:00:49,150
You know his name!
You called him an angel!

1900
02:00:49,223 --> 02:00:51,248
- No.
- You know his name!

1901
02:00:51,325 --> 02:00:52,758
- No, I don't know his name.
- Did you kill my son?

1902
02:00:52,826 --> 02:00:54,794
They cried for their parents to come
and get them and then I...

1903
02:00:54,862 --> 02:00:56,989
Did you kill my son?
Did you kill my son?

1904
02:00:57,064 --> 02:00:58,224
- Answer me!
- Or what?

1905
02:00:58,298 --> 02:00:59,629
Answer me!

1906
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:01,565
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hurt me?

1907
02:01:01,635 --> 02:01:03,660
I hope you go to hell.

1908
02:01:03,737 --> 02:01:05,602
I hope you go to hell.

1909
02:01:05,672 --> 02:01:07,333
- Did you kill my son?
- Guard! Hey, guard!

1910
02:01:07,408 --> 02:01:09,342
Did you kill my son?

1911
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:11,241
- Did you kill my son?
- Ma'am, please.

1912
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:13,404
- Come on.
- I hope you go to hell!

1913
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:17,712
I hope you go to hell!
I hope you go to hell!

1914
02:01:18,752 --> 02:01:20,310
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1915
02:01:22,423 --> 02:01:25,187
Did you kill my son?

1916
02:02:24,952 --> 02:02:26,852
"Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1917
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:29,821
you have been convicted of murder,

1918
02:02:29,890 --> 02:02:32,688
the penalty for which is death by hanging.

1919
02:02:34,027 --> 02:02:36,757
There have been no stays or reprieves,

1920
02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:38,855
therefore the execution will go forward

1921
02:02:38,932 --> 02:02:42,459
as stipulated under the laws
of the State of California."

1922
02:02:44,505 --> 02:02:46,996
Do you have any last words?

1923
02:02:47,074 --> 02:02:48,371
No.

1924
02:02:51,445 --> 02:02:52,673
Nothing.

1925
02:02:56,850 --> 02:03:00,342
I kept clean after I confessed, Reverend,

1926
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,354
just like I said I would.

1927
02:03:05,726 --> 02:03:07,990
Will it...

1928
02:03:08,061 --> 02:03:09,528
Will it hurt?

1929
02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:19,261
Please, please, not so fast.

1930
02:03:21,041 --> 02:03:23,441
Please, don't make me walk so fast!

1931
02:03:24,912 --> 02:03:27,779
Please, don't make me!

1932
02:03:27,848 --> 02:03:30,146
No, I don't wanna.

1933
02:03:41,128 --> 02:03:43,961
No! Thirteen steps.

1934
02:03:45,532 --> 02:03:47,625
Thirteen steps.

1935
02:03:47,701 --> 02:03:50,568
But I didn't touch them all,
you bastards.

1936
02:03:50,637 --> 02:03:54,198
I didn't touch them all.
I didn't touch them all.

1937
02:03:55,209 --> 02:03:56,938
Please!

1938
02:04:02,449 --> 02:04:05,612
A prayer! Please!

1939
02:04:06,553 --> 02:04:08,282
God!

1940
02:04:09,323 --> 02:04:13,384
Please! Somebody here, please,

1941
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:16,623
say a prayer for me!

1942
02:04:16,697 --> 02:04:19,860
No, God. No!

1943
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:24,394
No! No!

1944
02:04:35,115 --> 02:04:39,347
<i>Silent night</i>

1945
02:04:42,422 --> 02:04:46,518
<i>Holy night</i>

1946
02:04:48,061 --> 02:04:51,588
<i>All is calm</i>

1947
02:04:52,899 --> 02:04:56,835
<i>All is bright</i>

1948
02:04:57,838 --> 02:05:02,400
<i>Round young Virgin</i>

1949
02:05:03,076 --> 02:05:05,977
<i>Mother and child</i>

1950
02:05:57,831 --> 02:05:59,298
We're having a party tonight

1951
02:05:59,366 --> 02:06:01,391
at my place for the Academy show.

1952
02:06:01,468 --> 02:06:03,402
- You want to come?
- No, I have a million things to do.

1953
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:05,028
Oh, come on, please. Please!

1954
02:06:05,105 --> 02:06:07,801
You girls blew the phone lines
out from here to Baltimore.

1955
02:06:07,908 --> 02:06:09,136
Someone's gotta fix them.

1956
02:06:09,209 --> 02:06:10,801
Go, have a good night.
I have the radio.

1957
02:06:10,877 --> 02:06:12,435
Okay.

1958
02:06:13,513 --> 02:06:14,537
You sure?

1959
02:06:14,614 --> 02:06:15,638
I'm sure. I'm sure.
Have a good night.

1960
02:06:15,716 --> 02:06:17,479
- Good night.
- Good night.

1961
02:06:22,089 --> 02:06:24,057
Listen, I really...

1962
02:06:26,126 --> 02:06:27,491
Hello, Ben.

1963
02:06:29,396 --> 02:06:33,332
I'm meeting some friends at Musso
and Frank's for dinner.

1964
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:37,631
They're gonna pipe in the movie ceremonies
into the restaurant.

1965
02:06:37,704 --> 02:06:39,831
Should be quite a night.

1966
02:06:39,906 --> 02:06:41,965
I'd love it if you'd come.

1967
02:06:43,377 --> 02:06:46,175
I just have so much work I should be doing.

1968
02:06:48,215 --> 02:06:49,580
Good night.

1969
02:06:52,452 --> 02:06:53,612
Ben?

1970
02:06:55,455 --> 02:06:56,683
I...

1971
02:06:56,757 --> 02:06:58,622
<i>I put $2 down on
It Happened One Night</i>

1972
02:06:58,692 --> 02:07:00,159
to win Best Picture.

1973
02:07:00,227 --> 02:07:01,854
Seems I am the only person that thinks

1974
02:07:01,928 --> 02:07:03,793
<i>it has a chance against Cleopatra.</i>

1975
02:07:03,864 --> 02:07:05,923
But, if it wins,
do you wanna celebrate tomorrow night at dinner?

1976
02:07:07,467 --> 02:07:10,061
It's a deal, Christine.
See you.

1977
02:07:10,137 --> 02:07:12,765
If your movie wins, I'll call you.

1978
02:07:12,839 --> 02:07:14,306
I'll be here.

1979
02:07:18,412 --> 02:07:19,572
- Hi.
- Hi.

1980
02:07:21,681 --> 02:07:24,912
<i>The Thin Man, Cleopatra...</i>

1981
02:07:24,985 --> 02:07:26,612
Overrated.

1982
02:07:26,686 --> 02:07:28,745
<i>and It Happened One Night.</i>

1983
02:07:28,822 --> 02:07:30,756
Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert.

1984
02:07:30,824 --> 02:07:32,223
I rest my case.

1985
02:07:32,292 --> 02:07:34,726
<i>May I have the envelope, please?</i>

1986
02:07:36,363 --> 02:07:40,094
<i>And the winner is
It Happened One Night.</i>

1987
02:07:41,968 --> 02:07:44,163
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

1988
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:47,866
Dinner is on me.

1989
02:07:47,941 --> 02:07:49,806
<i>Is this Christine Collins?</i>

1990
02:07:49,876 --> 02:07:52,037
Yes, it is.

1991
02:07:52,112 --> 02:07:54,706
<i>This is Mrs. Clay.
Do you remember me?</i>

1992
02:07:55,348 --> 02:07:57,646
Mrs. Clay, of course I remember you.

1993
02:07:57,717 --> 02:07:59,776
<i>I just had to call you right off.</i>

1994
02:07:59,853 --> 02:08:02,117
<i>- What is it?
- The police just called.</i>

1995
02:08:02,189 --> 02:08:04,384
<i>They found a boy, Christine.</i>

1996
02:08:06,193 --> 02:08:08,320
<i>- Where?
- Lincoln Heights Precinct.</i>

1997
02:08:08,395 --> 02:08:09,862
<i>We're leaving right now.</i>

1998
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:11,420
I'll be right down.

1999
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,417
Oh, here.

2000
02:08:36,089 --> 02:08:37,454
I wanted to go to him right off,

2001
02:08:37,524 --> 02:08:40,652
but they said it was important
to talk to him alone first.

2002
02:08:40,727 --> 02:08:42,854
- Are they sure?
- They're sure.

2003
02:08:42,929 --> 02:08:46,092
But, more important, I'm sure.

2004
02:08:46,166 --> 02:08:47,258
It's my boy, all right.

2005
02:08:47,334 --> 02:08:49,165
It's David.

2006
02:08:49,236 --> 02:08:51,363
He's alive, Christine.

2007
02:08:51,438 --> 02:08:52,837
They found him up in Hesperia.

2008
02:08:52,906 --> 02:08:55,898
<i>You were walking home from school,</i>

2009
02:08:55,976 --> 02:08:58,171
<i>and they told you
they needed help finding a dog.</i>

2010
02:08:58,245 --> 02:08:59,507
<i>Yeah.</i>

2011
02:08:59,579 --> 02:09:02,639
<i>So, after you got in the truck,
what happened next?</i>

2012
02:09:02,716 --> 02:09:05,014
<i>They drove me around for a long time,</i>

2013
02:09:05,085 --> 02:09:06,643
then we ended up at this ranch.

2014
02:09:06,786 --> 02:09:10,187
Come on. Come on, Davy.

2015
02:09:10,257 --> 02:09:11,622
- Davy! Come on.
- Get off me.

2016
02:09:11,691 --> 02:09:12,885
Don't fight this much. Hey!

2017
02:09:12,959 --> 02:09:15,052
Were there other boys there?

2018
02:09:15,762 --> 02:09:18,230
<i>Yeah. Five, I think.</i>

2019
02:09:19,799 --> 02:09:21,733
It was a long time ago, though.

2020
02:09:21,801 --> 02:09:24,099
Hello, boys.
This is Davy.

2021
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:25,535
I know you'll make him feel...
Hey!

2022
02:09:26,706 --> 02:09:30,039
No. No! Hey! Shut up!

2023
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:32,010
Did you speak to them?

2024
02:09:32,779 --> 02:09:35,373
Yeah? You remember any of their names?

2025
02:09:36,249 --> 02:09:38,217
Yeah.

2026
02:09:38,285 --> 02:09:39,718
Two of them were brothers.

2027
02:09:39,786 --> 02:09:42,619
I think their last name was Winslow.

2028
02:09:43,924 --> 02:09:46,017
<i>The oldest one was Jeffrey.</i>

2029
02:09:49,996 --> 02:09:51,486
And Walter.

2030
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,424
<i>Walter?</i>

2031
02:09:56,202 --> 02:09:59,103
- Yeah.
- Do you remember Walter's last name?

2032
02:10:04,544 --> 02:10:05,806
Collins.

2033
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,038
<i>Walter Collins.</i>

2034
02:10:10,083 --> 02:10:13,314
Tell me something if you only remember
some of the boys' names,

2035
02:10:13,386 --> 02:10:16,048
how come you remember his full name?

2036
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:18,917
Because of what happened.

2037
02:10:18,992 --> 02:10:21,017
<i>Walter and Jeffrey were talking.</i>

2038
02:10:21,094 --> 02:10:23,028
<i>- Pull it.
- They kept checking around</i>

2039
02:10:23,096 --> 02:10:25,690
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

2040
02:10:25,765 --> 02:10:27,357
Be careful!

2041
02:10:27,434 --> 02:10:29,129
Hurry!

2042
02:10:29,202 --> 02:10:31,568
Maybe make enough room
to get out of there and run.

2043
02:10:31,638 --> 02:10:33,333
When we get out, we split up,

2044
02:10:33,406 --> 02:10:35,169
go in different directions. Okay?

2045
02:10:35,241 --> 02:10:37,334
They can't catch all of us.

2046
02:10:37,410 --> 02:10:39,378
It'd make an awful lot of noise.

2047
02:10:39,446 --> 02:10:42,176
Be quiet. You got it?

2048
02:10:42,248 --> 02:10:45,149
And if it wasn't wide enough,
then we'd be stuck.

2049
02:10:48,521 --> 02:10:51,718
Wait.
Help! Help! Come on, hurry!

2050
02:10:52,626 --> 02:10:55,925
My foot's stuck!
Hurry, help! Help me, please!

2051
02:10:58,498 --> 02:11:01,365
He's coming!
He's...

2052
02:11:01,434 --> 02:11:03,095
My foot!

2053
02:11:04,037 --> 02:11:05,561
He's coming.

2054
02:11:05,639 --> 02:11:07,402
Hurry, run, run, run!

2055
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,003
Hey! What the hell are you boys...

2056
02:11:16,883 --> 02:11:21,513
Oh! Mary, Mother of God!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2057
02:11:22,255 --> 02:11:25,315
You get back here!
Hey! Hold it! Hey!

2058
02:11:27,794 --> 02:11:28,886
Hey!

2059
02:11:30,063 --> 02:11:31,121
Hey!

2060
02:11:32,332 --> 02:11:33,959
Stop!

2061
02:11:36,302 --> 02:11:37,667
Check on the others!

2062
02:11:37,737 --> 02:11:39,136
Stop! Damn it!

2063
02:11:39,205 --> 02:11:41,469
Boys, I'm coming after you!

2064
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:44,635
Damn it! Damn it!

2065
02:11:44,944 --> 02:11:47,879
Boys, I'll find you no matter where you are!

2066
02:11:47,947 --> 02:11:50,313
- They're not in there!
- Come on! Get in the car!

2067
02:11:50,383 --> 02:11:54,513
I'm gonna find you!
Damn it! Damn it! Come on.

2068
02:11:54,587 --> 02:11:56,987
Shit! Get in the car, Sanford!

2069
02:12:04,464 --> 02:12:07,092
That was the last I saw of any of them.

2070
02:12:07,667 --> 02:12:10,693
So, you don't know
if either of the other two were captured?

2071
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:11,862
No.

2072
02:12:13,139 --> 02:12:15,039
All I know is,

2073
02:12:15,108 --> 02:12:17,975
if Walter hadn't come back for me

2074
02:12:18,845 --> 02:12:21,575
<i>I don't think I ever
would've gotten out of there.</i>

2075
02:12:22,482 --> 02:12:23,847
Okay.

2076
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:27,279
So, what happened after that?

2077
02:12:27,353 --> 02:12:29,048
I kept off the main roads,

2078
02:12:29,122 --> 02:12:34,082
until I saw a train stopped at a crossing
and I jumped in.

2079
02:12:34,494 --> 02:12:37,554
Why didn't you tell anyone what had happened?

2080
02:12:37,630 --> 02:12:39,097
I was afraid.

2081
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:42,568
I thought they'd come after me, or my folks.

2082
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:46,804
<i>So, I just didn't tell anybody.</i>

2083
02:12:48,675 --> 02:12:52,873
I was on my own until I got a free meal
from this lady, Miss Lansing.

2084
02:12:52,946 --> 02:12:55,437
Told her I was an orphan, on my own.

2085
02:12:57,417 --> 02:12:59,408
She said I could stay on.

2086
02:13:00,854 --> 02:13:02,185
And I did.

2087
02:13:03,423 --> 02:13:04,788
<i>Every night,</i>

2088
02:13:04,858 --> 02:13:08,294
I'd wake up thinking
they were right outside my window.

2089
02:13:08,828 --> 02:13:11,296
And then I heard the police
talking on the radio

2090
02:13:11,364 --> 02:13:14,128
about what happened at the ranch.

2091
02:13:14,234 --> 02:13:16,600
And I thought,
"For sure I can't go back now."

2092
02:13:16,669 --> 02:13:18,136
Why?

2093
02:13:18,671 --> 02:13:19,729
Why not?

2094
02:13:19,806 --> 02:13:22,604
Since I didn't tell anybody what happened.

2095
02:13:23,977 --> 02:13:26,741
I was afraid they'd blame me
for those kids being dead.

2096
02:13:28,648 --> 02:13:30,513
So I just stayed away.

2097
02:13:32,252 --> 02:13:35,244
What made you come forward now,
after all this time?

2098
02:13:35,321 --> 02:13:37,881
Hmm? Why come forward now?

2099
02:13:41,461 --> 02:13:43,224
I really miss my mom.

2100
02:13:45,632 --> 02:13:47,532
I really miss my dad.

2101
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:52,538
I just wanna go home.

2102
02:13:55,942 --> 02:13:57,739
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

2103
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,513
Are you all right?

2104
02:14:06,186 --> 02:14:08,381
I love you.

2105
02:14:40,887 --> 02:14:42,650
I still can't believe it.

2106
02:14:42,722 --> 02:14:46,624
Five years, case closed,
everyone thinks he's dead, and there he is.

2107
02:14:48,127 --> 02:14:50,891
Wouldn't be, if it wasn't for Walter.

2108
02:14:52,565 --> 02:14:55,125
Your son did a brave thing, Mrs. Collins.

2109
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:57,396
You should be very proud of him.

2110
02:14:57,470 --> 02:14:58,801
I am.

2111
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:02,698
You still think he's out there?

2112
02:15:02,775 --> 02:15:04,003
Why not?

2113
02:15:05,245 --> 02:15:07,213
Three boys made a run for it
that night, Detective.

2114
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,804
And if one got out,

2115
02:15:08,882 --> 02:15:11,976
then maybe either
or both of the others did, too.

2116
02:15:12,051 --> 02:15:15,612
Maybe Walter's out there,
having the same fears that he did.

2117
02:15:15,722 --> 02:15:17,587
Afraid to come home and identify himself,

2118
02:15:17,657 --> 02:15:20,057
or afraid he'll get into trouble.

2119
02:15:21,494 --> 02:15:23,587
But either way,

2120
02:15:23,663 --> 02:15:26,791
it gives me something I didn't have
before tonight.

2121
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,299
What's that?

2122
02:15:29,269 --> 02:15:30,463
Hope.
