1
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,536
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY

2
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,296
TO KÄBI
MY WIFE

3
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,531
I was first up on the jetty!

4
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,210
That was refreshing.

5
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,180
If Papa and Martin put out the nets,
Minus and I will get the milk.

6
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,549
No, David and Minus can put out the nets
so I can take my wife for a walk.

7
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,385
Can't Karin and I put out the nets,
while Minus and Martin get the milk?

8
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,019
I won't do either.
I'll decide for myself what I want to do.

9
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,962
I haven't seen you all day, Minus.
Let's go.

10
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,329
Why should women always decide?

11
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:54,100
I say we do as Karin says.
That way we won't lose our dignity.

12
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,802
Think of the time we'd have saved
if Papa had decided that right off.

13
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,345
Should we get dressed
before we put out the nets?

14
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,973
What do you think?

15
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,143
- Isn't it rather chilly?
- You think?

16
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,914
My bathrobe is thinner than yours.

17
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,957
- If you're cold -
- Me cold? Not a bit. Are you?

18
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:16,518
You're the one who said it was chilly.
There is a bit of a breeze, though.

19
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,287
We'll harden ourselves.
Virility overrules health, right?

20
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,534
If Hemingway could do it, so can we.
Forward march.

21
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,895
Think there'll be a thunderstorm?

22
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,495
No, not tonight.

23
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,159
I don't know.
Look at those clouds.

24
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,429
Are you afraid of thunder?

25
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,097
You have no idea
how terrified I am of it.

26
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,171
When it would roll through the Alps,
God help us!

27
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,006
- Did you like it there otherwise?
- I was homesick.

28
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:10,010
But I wasn't coming home
until I'd finished the novel.

29
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,515
And now it's finished?

30
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,718
Yes, pretty much.

31
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,178
- How's your ulcer?
- So-so.

32
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,781
Can you prescribe something?
It hurts due to the climate change.

33
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,692
We'll go to the pharmacy tomorrow.
I have errands to run anyway.

34
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,730
Did you get my last letter?
I sent it on Monday.

35
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,128
I was in Basel visiting the Waldsteins.
They send their regards.

36
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,672
Then you didn't get it.

37
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,538
- I flew here on Wednesday.
- Then you didn't get it.

38
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,478
- Was it important?
- It was about Karin.

39
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,876
I felt I had to write

40
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,809
even if it disturbed your writing.

41
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:59,471
What?

42
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,757
- A cuckoo. Didn't you hear it?
- No.

43
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,964
- Surely you hear it now.
- Where?

44
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,171
There.

45
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,967
When did you wash your ears out last?

46
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,143
Stop it.
Yours are too sensitive.

47
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,942
It's strange, but since my illness,
my hearing has become so acute.

48
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,779
Maybe it's the electric shock therapy.

49
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,087
How did Papa look to you yesterday
when he arrived from Switzerland?

50
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,248
- How do you mean?
- I thought he looked gray.

51
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,826
- Tired from the journey, I suppose.
- Probably.

52
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,827
But he doesn't seem happy.

53
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,229
- Is Marianne coming here?
- Martin said they broke up.

54
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,165
Poor Papa. Alone again.

55
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,370
I never liked Marianne.

56
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,496
She put on such airs,

57
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,900
and poor Papa
looked so ordinary next to her.

58
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,409
And then she sneered at his books.

59
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,708
Papa has to get
good reviews on this book.

60
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,544
But everybody reads his books.

61
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,483
He doesn't care about the sales.

62
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,611
He wants to be a writer.

63
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,153
What are you laughing at?

64
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,559
You're so tall and so serious.

65
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,230
"He wants to be a writer."

66
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,168
Don't look so hurt.
I love you, little Minus.

67
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,865
- You've grown so tall.
- Stop being so silly.

68
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,904
Seventeen and nearly ten feet tall.

69
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,150
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Who'd want to be with me?

70
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,651
Don't be mad
because I laughed at you.

71
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,035
Edgar is the only psychiatrist
I trust.

72
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,906
He's treated her all along.

73
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,304
And?

74
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,412
When Karin came home
from the hospital last month,

75
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,144
he and I had a good talk.

76
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,717
He couldn't guarantee
a permanent recovery.

77
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,318
And now?

78
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,521
She seems unusually well.

79
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,295
She hasn't been sleeping well.

80
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,899
Her hearing has become very acute.
That's about it.

81
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,367
How much does she know?

82
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,539
She actually knows
the whole truth about her illness,

83
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,511
but not that it's relatively incurable.

84
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,013
You say relatively?

85
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,979
Edgar has had cases of full recovery,
so there is hope.

86
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,387
How are things between you?

87
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,983
Fine, thank you.

88
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,519
The days pass by as usual.

89
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:50,995
I've given my lectures all spring
and examined numerous students.

90
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
I've come to realize that I love her

91
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,706
and that I'm helplessly bound to her,
whatever happens.

92
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,849
I've become the anchor
of her existence,

93
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,683
perhaps her only security.

94
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,852
I see.

95
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,021
Well, shall we put out the nets?

96
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,620
Yes, let's.

97
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:47,960
Minus!

98
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,325
Hey.

99
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,762
Be careful now.

100
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,295
Keep away from me.

101
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,460
Stop hugging and kissing me.

102
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,933
Stop sunbathing half naked.
You disgust me.

103
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,112
What?

104
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,576
You know very well what I mean.
Women are horrible.

105
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,137
How they smell and move around,
how they stick out their stomachs,

106
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,306
how they comb their hair and talk.

107
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,593
Makes me feel like a skinned rabbit!

108
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,852
Poor boy.

109
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:19,084
Thanks. I can give myself
all the pity I want.

110
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,528
What's wrong?
I've never seen you like this.

111
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,662
Please don't tell Martin or Papa.

112
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,597
Don't be silly.

113
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,065
I wish I could talk to Papa, just once.

114
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,840
He's so wrapped up in himself.

115
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,204
Him too.

116
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,216
Let's go home.

117
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,982
- I spilled the milk.
- Careless boy.

118
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,556
Damn!
I hate it when I hurt my finger.

119
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,094
Put a bandage on it.

120
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,959
Hello.

121
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,063
- Martin cut his finger.
- Let's have a look.

122
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,467
I'll put the milk in the cellar.

123
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,203
- It looks deep. Put a bandage on it.
- So much fuss over a little finger.

124
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,772
Isn't it beautiful, supper by lantern
and moonlight?

125
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,652
- You're a master chef, Papa.
- It smells wonderful.

126
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,380
Smell it, Minus.

127
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,519
You should write cookbooks
instead of novels.

128
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,262
How shall we sit?
Karin there, and you over there,

129
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,463
Minus over there and me here.

130
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,538
- How I've longed for this moment.
- Why?

131
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,572
I was homesick the whole time.

132
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,671
- For us?
- Yes, even for you.

133
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,248
Are you staying?

134
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,286
For this month, at least.

135
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,878
Are you going away again?

136
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,891
I'm in charge of a tour to Yugoslavia.

137
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,620
In charge of a tour? Why?

138
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,491
It's a very flattering offer.

139
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,332
A cultural delegation.

140
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,864
Since I know the country, why not?

141
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,832
Well, cheers, David.
Welcome home.

142
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,964
Thank you.

143
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,655
- Cheers, Karin.
- Cheers.

144
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:19,901
- Cheers, Minus.
- Cheers.

145
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,115
What about your book?

146
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,149
It'll be finished by then.

147
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,959
I spoke to the publishers.
I'll turn in the manuscript next week.

148
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,452
- Will you be away long?
- I'm not sure.

149
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,128
I may stay a while in Dubrovnik
after the others go home.

150
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,577
I feel like a criminal for some reason.

151
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,141
You promised to stay home
after Switzerland, didn't you?

152
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,479
I vaguely remember discussing it,
but as for promising...

153
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,181
Yes, Papa, you promised.

154
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,294
How unfortunate.

155
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,227
Yes, it is.

156
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,103
This was to be a nice evening,

157
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,077
and instead
we're on the verge of tears.

158
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,280
I've got presents for you all
from Switzerland.

159
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,613
Karin.

160
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,588
And Martin.

161
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,156
Thanks. You shouldn't have.

162
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,452
Minus.

163
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,030
- Can we open them now?
- Yes, do.

164
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,663
Excuse me.
I'm going to get my tobacco.

165
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,678
These won't even fit my thumbs.

166
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,544
I have one just like this.

167
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,983
I bet he didn't think of them
till he got to Stockholm.

168
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,418
It was a kind thought.

169
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,813
- Thank you so much, David.
- Thanks for the lovely gloves.

170
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,057
We've got a surprise for you too.

171
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,287
- We have to blindfold you.
- Don't peek.

172
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,798
I'll take care of this.
You go ahead.

173
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,766
I can't see a thing.

174
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,337
It's like walking on clouds.
Who's idea was this?

175
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,707
Minus'.

176
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,405
Karin and I helped.

177
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,148
Wait and see.

178
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,653
This is almost like Shakespeare.

179
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,967
Are you ready?

180
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:16,177
Our play is called
<i>The Artistic Haunting</i>

181
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,676
or <i>The Tomb of Illusions</i>.

182
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,313
Let the play begin.

183
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,516
It's midnight
in Saint Teresa's Chapel.

184
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,957
Here I shall meet my heart's desire.

185
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,929
Here, by this tomb
redolent with the smell of death.

186
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,059
Someone moved inside.
Could it be her?

187
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,936
I'll hide so as not to frighten her.

188
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,707
Who are you?

189
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,608
I am the princess of Castile,

190
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,772
who died in childbirth
in her 13th year.

191
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,351
My husband and beloved master,
who was my playmate as a child,

192
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,048
has turned to other women.

193
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,591
Princess, I love you!

194
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,126
Who are you?

195
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,227
I cannot speak to just anybody,
even though I am dead.

196
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,323
Fear not, fair lady.

197
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,936
I am ruler of my own kingdom,
small and poor though it may be.

198
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,398
I am an artist.

199
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,337
An artist?

200
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,570
Yes, Princess!
An artist of the purest kind.

201
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,905
A poet without poems,
a painter without paintings...

202
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,052
- Musician.
- A musician without notes.

203
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,852
I scorn ready-made art,
the banal result of vulgar effort.

204
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:38,060
My life is my work,
and it is dedicated to my love for you.

205
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,597
Beautiful words,
but hard to believe.

206
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,860
I beg of you, put me to the test.

207
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,597
Listen carefully.
In a moment I will leave you.

208
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,807
When the convent clock strikes 2:00,

209
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,944
you shall enter the tomb
and blow out the three candles inside.

210
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,149
At that instant
the doors will close forever,

211
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,719
and you shall join me in death.

212
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,152
An easy sacrifice, my princess.

213
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,153
For what is life to a true artist?

214
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:18,298
You thus perfect your work of art
and crown your love.

215
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,670
You ennoble your life
and show the skeptics

216
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,108
what a true artist can do.

217
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,108
Farewell, my friend.

218
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,545
Do not fail me.

219
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,489
I face the moment
of ultimate perfection.

220
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,589
I tremble with anticipation.

221
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,985
Oblivion shall own me

222
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,161
and death alone shall love me.

223
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,860
I will go.
Nothing can stop me.

224
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,737
<i>I am waiting.

225
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,568
Ye devils, what am I about to do?

226
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,340
Sacrifice my life? For what?

227
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,908
For eternity?

228
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,379
For the perfect work of art?
For love?

229
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,178
- Have I gone mad?
- <i>I am waiting</i>.

230
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,943
Who shall see my sacrifice?
Death.

231
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,251
Who shall gauge
the depth of my love? A ghost.

232
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,583
And who shall thank me? Eternity.

233
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,991
I am waiting.

234
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,392
My knees turn to clay,
my whole body trembles,

235
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,627
and my insides run like water.

236
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,726
I cannot enter eternity with...

237
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,635
I shall wait no longer.

238
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,874
Well... such is life.

239
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,450
I could, of course, write a poem
about my meeting with the princess.

240
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,186
Or paint a picture
or compose an opera,

241
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,620
although it would need
a more heroic ending.

242
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,559
Oblivion shall own me

243
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,929
and death alone shall love me.

244
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,933
Not bad.

245
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,897
The cock heralds the dawn.

246
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,444
I shall go home to bed.

247
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,084
That's all.

248
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,449
Author! Author!

249
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,148
You were fantastic!

250
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,220
- And you were excellent.
- It was all Minus' doing.

251
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,059
- But I forgot my lines.
- I never noticed.

252
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,345
Let's clear the table and clean up.

253
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,678
No, I'll do it.
It's too early for bed.

254
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,775
Not on your life.

255
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,413
I like puttering around.
You'd actually be doing me a service.

256
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,026
- Well, in that case...
- It's settled, then.

257
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,690
I'll get cracking right away.

258
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,164
Are you going to bed now?
- Yes.

259
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,726
There's hot water in the kitchen.

260
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,132
You were smart to think ahead.

261
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,673
- The thunderstorm has passed.
- I told you so.

262
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,175
We left the window open.
We'll have mosquitoes in the bedroom.

263
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,006
A few mosquitoes won't hurt you.

264
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,545
Good night, Papa.

265
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,372
Good night, Karin. Sleep well.

266
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,440
Good night, everybody.

267
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,949
- Can you manage?
- I'm fine.

268
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,990
- I'll help you.
- I'm fine.

269
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,868
Could you help me?

270
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,879
How black they get
from your gardening.

271
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,250
It won't come off.

272
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,518
You have such kind fingers.

273
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,090
But your thumb looks
rather stubborn.

274
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,391
- Are you sad, Karin?
- Not really.

275
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,901
What are you thinking about?

276
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,667
Sometimes we're so defenseless.

277
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,211
No, I don't know.

278
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,444
Like children cast out
into the wilderness at night.

279
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,848
The owls fly past, watching you
with their yellow eyes.

280
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,249
You hear the pitter-patter and rustling,
the soughing and sighing,

281
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,194
all the damp noses sniffing at you.

282
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,959
The wolves bare their teeth.

283
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,768
Don't worry.
You and I have each other.

284
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,097
You look worried.
I'm not so sure about that.

285
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,568
I'm not worried at all.

286
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,576
You say, "There are no wolves.

287
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,006
I see nothing,
and there's no owl either.

288
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,073
I don't hear a sound,
and the wolf is only your imagination."

289
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,948
You have to trust me, Karin.

290
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,313
Little Kajsa.

291
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,723
"Little Kajsa."

292
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,219
You always say that.

293
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,559
Am I so little, or has the illness
made a child of me?

294
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,197
Do I seem strange to you?

295
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,568
- Do you think I speak the truth?
- I don't know.

296
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,739
- Don't you think I love you?
- Yes, I do.

297
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,447
Isn't that enough?

298
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,311
Of course it's enough.

299
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:13,115
- Leave it, or you'll start bleeding.
- I'll be all right.

300
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,762
I have to do some washing tomorrow.

301
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,460
Come to bed, Karin.

302
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,137
Did you notice that Papa took
Minus' play as a personal affront?

303
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,501
He was terribly hurt
but tried not to let on.

304
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,172
And that upset Minus, of course.

305
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,786
Shall we put out the light?

306
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,158
I'm sorry if I upset you.

307
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,900
Dearest child.

308
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,263
Forgive me.

309
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,632
Dearest beloved.

310
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,672
My dear, dear girl.

311
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,075
Sweetheart, I love you.

312
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,446
You couldn't upset me.

313
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,014
You're so kind, and I'm so horrid.

314
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,648
Good night.

315
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,322
"She came towards him,
panting with anticipation...

316
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,059
cheeks rosy
from the blustering wind."

317
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,463
My God.

318
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,833
"They met

319
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,426
on the beach."

320
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,672
Hello, little Kajsa.

321
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,978
Are you up already?
It can't be later than 4:00.

322
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,783
- Hello, Papa.
- What is it?

323
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,923
Having trouble?

324
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,825
I'm adding the finishing
touches to my book,

325
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,029
which is never much fun.

326
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,390
- Read to me.
- Later, when I get the proofs.

327
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,136
How come you're not asleep?

328
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,207
Some birds made frightening noises
right at sunrise.

329
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,105
They woke me up,

330
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,435
and then I didn't dare
go back to sleep.

331
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,847
Just a moment.

332
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,727
Just like when I was little.

333
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,662
Now you'll sleep.
You'll see.

334
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,687
"They met on the beach.

335
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,650
It was a clear day.

336
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,718
Autumn was in the air."

337
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,449
Papa!

338
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:22,993
Karin just fell asleep.

339
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,627
Want to come and pull in the nets?

340
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,297
I'll be right there.

341
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,871
Last summer I was as good
at walking on my hands as on my feet.

342
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,497
Now I'm so tall,
I've lost all balance.

343
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,836
Same here.

344
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,210
You mean spiritually.
I get it.

345
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,936
- Do you write these days?
- Plays.

346
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,948
- May I read some of it?
- No.

347
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,811
Sorry. Nothing personal,
but they're not very good.

348
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,512
Have you written a lot?

349
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,886
Thirteen plays
and an opera this summer.

350
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,284
My goodness.

351
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,589
It comes gushing out of me.
Isn't it the same for you?

352
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,461
No.

353
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,066
What did you think of our play
last night? Honestly.

354
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,800
It was nice.

355
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,632
I thought it was crap.

356
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,980
"Her illness is incurable...

357
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,344
with periods of
temporary improvement.

358
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,657
I have long suspected it,

359
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,559
but the certainty is
nevertheless almost unbearable.

360
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,891
I'm horrified by my curiosity,

361
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,999
by my urge to record its course...

362
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:56,068
to make an accurate description
of her gradual disintegration...

363
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,307
to use her."

364
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,926
Martin, wake up.
How long are you going to sleep?

365
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,293
Time for a swim.
Get up now.

366
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,736
- What time is it?
- Almost 10:00.

367
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,536
Heavens, have I slept that long?

368
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,478
- You little imp. It's only 5:00.
- So what?

369
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,781
I've been up for ages and had
all kinds of odd experiences,

370
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,715
while you just slept.

371
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,722
- Come over here.
- No, get up. We're going for a swim.

372
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,357
Papa and Minus are doing the nets.

373
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,858
Come here.

374
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,495
You sleep too much.

375
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,104
That's what makes you
such a know-it-all.

376
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,208
My little one, what's wrong?

377
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,743
Nothing.

378
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,453
What is it, Karin?

379
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,385
I have a confession.

380
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,323
Out with it then.

381
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:57,265
When Papa went out just now,
I rummaged through his desk.

382
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,730
I don't know why.
I just felt I had to.

383
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,297
And?

384
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,611
- I found his diary.
- And?

385
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,583
- He'd written things in it.
- Like what?

386
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,720
About me.

387
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,753
What had he written?

388
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,652
I can't tell you.

389
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,857
About your illness?

390
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,933
Is it true it's incurable?

391
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,535
Dearest Karin, listen to me.

392
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,004
Listen to me now.

393
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,072
Look at me.

394
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,743
I told David there's a chance
you'll have a relapse.

395
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,943
It's possible he misunderstood me.

396
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,521
No one can say
your illness is incurable.

397
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,819
Word of honor?

398
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,287
Word of honor.

399
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,162
There now.

400
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,261
There was more.

401
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,193
Well?

402
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,902
I can't tell you.

403
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,529
- Please.
- I couldn't possibly.

404
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,000
Ask him yourself.

405
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,906
Karin, little Karin.

406
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,483
Martin?

407
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,948
You must be patient with me.

408
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,491
I'm sure my desire will come back.

409
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,593
- Don't you think?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,689
- Does it worry you?
- Not in the least.

411
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,334
Listen, I'm terribly tired...

412
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,475
but I still think
we should go for a swim.

413
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,805
It's not cold at all.

414
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,359
Martin?

415
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:02,319
Imagine having a stable wife
who gave you children, and coffee in bed,

416
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,829
who was big and soft
and warm and beautiful.

417
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,023
Wouldn't that be nice after all?

418
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,863
- It's you I love.
- Of course, but all the same.

419
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,133
I don't want anyone else.

420
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,211
Funny... even though you always
say and do the right thing,

421
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,049
it turns out wrong.

422
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,824
If I do, it's out of love.

423
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,589
He that loves for real
always does right by his loved one.

424
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,858
In that case you don't love me.

425
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,707
Bye, Minus.

426
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,643
Bye.

427
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,698
Make sure poor Minus
doesn't fall asleep over his Latin.

428
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,292
- I said I'd test him on his grammar.
- Bye, my girl.

429
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,174
Don't forget your brandy,
and get a bottle of white wine.

430
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,334
My very thought.

431
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,037
- Bye, darling.
- We'll be back for dinner.

432
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,017
What the hell are you laughing at?

433
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,317
Eh?

434
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,229
Say something.

435
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,996
Have a look, if it's so amusing.

436
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,129
Which are your favorites?

437
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,800
Don't be such an old maid.
Come and show me.

438
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,311
You like her best? Why?

439
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,051
She's so soft.

440
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,246
I think she's pretty too.
But isn't she a bit fat?

441
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,690
- And her hair is so long...
- She doesn't look too deep.

442
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,127
But it doesn't help me a damn bit.

443
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,864
Are you going to hit me?

444
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,541
It was my fault.
Forgive me.

445
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,113
Calm down, Minus.

446
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,385
It doesn't matter.
Don't worry.

447
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,816
I was silly and curious.
Forgive me.

448
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,227
I don't mean to.
It just happens.

449
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,269
- Did you study?
- More or less.

450
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,073
- Shall I test you?
- If you'd like.

451
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,359
I wonder if everyone is caged in.

452
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,141
What?

453
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,281
You in your cage, I in mine.

454
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,848
Each in his own little cube.
Everybody.

455
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,048
I don't feel caged in at all.

456
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,881
Then I'm wrong, as usual.

457
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,892
<i>Constructio ad sensum</i>.
What does that mean?

458
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,455
Oh, no, you don't.

459
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:02,498
It means that a grammatically correct
construction is changed

460
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,760
to suit the context.

461
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,893
For example?

462
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:11,638
<i>Nobilitas rem publicam deseru...

463
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,437
<i>Deseruerant.

464
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,345
It's so hot.

465
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,342
And I've been up since 4:30.

466
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,815
Let's have a cigarette.
Got any?

467
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,526
If you look long enough
with your head tilted to one side,

468
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,491
it gives you the creeps.

469
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,327
The creeps?

470
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,935
Though it's fascinating.

471
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,272
I don't talk to Papa or Martin about it.
They don't understand.

472
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:49,103
Particularly not Martin. He's too
anxious and has enough worries as it is.

473
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,410
They don't understand.
They just think I'm sick.

474
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,353
- Do you think so too?
- No.

475
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,325
I knew you didn't.

476
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,831
You're stronger.

477
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,637
I've so often wanted to talk to you
about it all. It's like a...

478
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,569
You can trust me.

479
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,544
It's hard not to talk about something
that's constantly on your mind.

480
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,447
But I don't think the others
would mind my telling you.

481
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,914
"The others"?

482
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,578
Don't fluster me
with a lot of stupid questions.

483
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,554
Either I tell you all I dare,
or it's over.

484
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,353
- I'm curious.
- That's fine for you.

485
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,794
Let me show you something.

486
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,270
I walk through the wall, you see.

487
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,377
Early in the morning I'm woken
by someone calling me in a firm voice.

488
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,082
I rise and come to this room.

489
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,384
One day someone called me
from behind the wallpaper.

490
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,059
I looked in the closet,
but there was no one there.

491
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,367
But the voice kept calling me,

492
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:02,377
so I pressed myself against the wall,
and it gave way, like foliage,

493
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,204
and I was inside.

494
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,714
You think I'm making it up?

495
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,391
I enter a large room.

496
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,491
It's bright and peaceful.

497
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,231
People are moving back and forth.

498
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,542
Some of them talk to me,
and I understand them.

499
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,608
It's so nice, and I feel safe.

500
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:44,779
In some of their faces
there's a shining light.

501
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,392
Everyone is waiting for him to come,

502
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,958
but no one is anxious.

503
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,530
They say that I can be there
when it happens.

504
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,371
Why are you crying?

505
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,001
It's nothing.

506
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,709
Nothing to worry about.

507
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,548
But... sometimes I have
this intense yearning.

508
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,454
I long for that moment...

509
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,128
when the door will open...

510
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,697
and all the faces will turn to him.

511
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,992
Who is coming?

512
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,600
No one has said for certain.

513
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,643
But I think it's God
who will reveal himself to us.

514
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,382
That it will be him
coming into the room

515
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,014
through that door.

516
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:05,557
Minus.

517
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,936
I have something
difficult to tell you.

518
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,003
- What's that?
- I turn away from Martin.

519
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,844
He stands there calling me,
but I can't help him.

520
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,979
It all becomes like a game.

521
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,044
- Does he notice anything?
- I'm not sure.

522
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,154
I must choose
between him and the others.

523
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,549
I've made up my mind.

524
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,423
I've sacrificed Martin.

525
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,423
Is all this for real?

526
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,930
I don't know.

527
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,230
I'm caught in the middle,
and sometimes I'm uncertain.

528
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,601
I know I've been ill
and that my illness was like a dream.

529
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,707
But these are no dreams.

530
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,576
They must be real.
They must be real.

531
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,679
They're not real for me,
not in the least.

532
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,353
Karin.

533
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,090
- They're not real for me.
- Oh, yes.

534
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,063
A god steps down from the mountain.

535
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,569
He walks through the dark forest.

536
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,840
There are wild beasts everywhere
in the silent darkness.

537
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,673
It must be real.

538
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,850
I'm not dreaming.
I'm telling the truth.

539
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,557
Now I'm in one world,
now in the other.

540
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,324
I can't stop it.

541
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,737
Shall we go for a swim?

542
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,077
I'll go alone then.

543
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,675
I'm sleepy.

544
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,043
I'm going to sleep a bit.

545
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,280
Close the door when you leave.

546
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,599
Stop that! Get out!

547
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,077
What the hell am I to do?

548
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,297
Well, have you prepared your Latin?

549
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,696
Let's continue.

550
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,706
But first we'll have some tea.

551
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,842
Minus.

552
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,812
Will you tell Papa and Martin?

553
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,846
Tell them what?

554
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,652
Clever answer, but you don't fool me.

555
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,419
Tonight you'll take
Martin aside and say:

556
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,455
"I have to talk to you about Karin."
And then you'll tell him everything.

557
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,095
- Can't you tell him?
- Promise not to say anything.

558
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,059
I promise.

559
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,896
You're the only one
who understands.

560
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,363
Say one word
and you've betrayed me.

561
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,231
I promise.

562
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,288
- It looks like rain.
- Do you think so?

563
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,424
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

564
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,851
You're so quiet, almost hostile.

565
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,495
- It's not worth talking about.
- Please.

566
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,046
- It's about Karin.
- Karin?

567
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,465
She rummaged through your desk
and found your diary.

568
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,375
And she read it, of course.

569
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,777
Oh, no.

570
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,711
What did you write?

571
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,844
Karin wanted me to ask you.

572
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,684
I wrote that her illness is incurable.

573
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:30,025
That I felt a horrible urge
to record its course.

574
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,561
There's no one else to blame.

575
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,095
I've no excuse.

576
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:40,240
It's always about you and yours.

577
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,547
Your callousness is perverse.

578
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,782
"Record its course."
That's so typical.

579
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,584
You don't understand.

580
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,956
No, I don't.

581
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,254
But one thing I do understand.

582
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,329
You're always on the hunt
for subjects.

583
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,595
Your daughter's insanity.

584
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,860
What a great idea!

585
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,327
I love her, Martin.

586
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:12,033
Love her?
You're void of all feeling.

587
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,143
You lack common decency.

588
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,375
You know how to express yourself.
You always have just the right words.

589
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,316
There's just one thing you haven't
the slightest clue about:

590
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,210
life itself.

591
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,120
You're a craven coward,

592
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:33,027
but a genius
at evasions and excuses.

593
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,961
What do you want me to do?

594
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,364
Write your book.

595
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,933
Maybe it will give you
your heart's desire.

596
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,002
Your big breakthrough as a writer.

597
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:48,542
Then you won't have sacrificed
your daughter in vain, and...

598
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,415
Go ahead, say it.

599
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,820
In your novels
you're always courting some god.

600
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,188
But let me tell you,

601
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,595
your faith and your doubt
are very unconvincing.

602
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,693
All that's apparent
is your ingenuity.

603
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,528
Don't you think I know that?

604
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,464
Then why go on?

605
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,907
Why not do something
respectable instead?

606
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,272
Such as?

607
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:27,576
Have you written one word of truth
in your life as an author?

608
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,845
- I don't know.
- See?

609
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:34,890
Your half-lies are so refined
that they look like truth.

610
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,516
- I do my best.
- Maybe you do.

611
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,220
But you fall short.

612
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,759
I know.

613
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,232
You're empty but clever.

614
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:52,867
Now you're trying to fill your void
with Karin's extinction.

615
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,911
But I don't see
how you'll bring God into that.

616
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,244
It'll make him
more inscrutable than ever.

617
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,375
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

618
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,313
Can you always control
your innermost thoughts?

619
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:08,888
Fortunately I'm not very complex.

620
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:13,761
My world is very simple.
Quite clear and human.

621
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,763
Still you've wished Karin would die?

622
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,060
Absolutely not.

623
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,761
Only you could think such a thing.

624
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,703
Can you swear
you've never thought of it?

625
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,104
It would be logical.

626
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,269
You know that
her case is hopeless,

627
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,947
and that both your suffering
is pointless.

628
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,711
She might as well be dead.

629
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,343
You are grotesque.

630
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,354
That depends entirely
on your point of view.

631
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,848
I love her.

632
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,923
I'm powerless.

633
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,223
I can only stand by and watch

634
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,169
as she is transformed
into a poor, tormented animal.

635
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,408
Let me tell you something.

636
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,215
When I was in Switzerland,
I decided to kill myself.

637
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,452
I hired a car and found a cliff.

638
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,346
I set out calmly.

639
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,315
It was afternoon.
The valley was already in darkness.

640
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,295
I was empty.
No fear, no regrets, no expectations.

641
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,699
I aimed the car at the cliff,
stepped on the gas...

642
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,170
and stalled, stopping dead.

643
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,170
The transmission went out, you see.

644
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:36,144
The car slid on the gravel
and came to a halt,

645
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,874
front wheels over the edge.

646
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,974
I crawled out of the car, trembling.

647
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,820
I leaned against a rock
across the road.

648
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,284
I sat gasping for breath for hours.

649
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,859
Why are you telling me this?

650
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,499
To tell you I no longer have
any pretense to keep up.

651
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,104
The truth won't bring catastrophe.

652
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,700
This has nothing to do with Karin.

653
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,538
I think it does.

654
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,912
I don't understand.

655
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,339
From the void within me,
something was born that I can't touch...

656
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,313
or name:

657
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,954
a love.

658
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,222
For Karin. And Minus.

659
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,463
And you.

660
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,629
One day I may tell you about it.

661
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,095
I dare not do it now.

662
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,040
But if...

663
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,236
But if it's the way I'm hoping...

664
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,547
Let's leave it for now.

665
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,000
The rain is coming.

666
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,273
No.

667
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,072
Yes.

668
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,148
The rain is coming.

669
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,025
Karin, is that you?

670
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,190
It's me, Karin.

671
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,999
Can't you hear me, Karin?

672
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,670
I'm not well.

673
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:09,938
Let's go home.

674
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,015
- You have to help me.
- How can I help you?

675
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,742
You have to help me.

676
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,254
I'm so thirsty.

677
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,052
I'll get some water.

678
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,812
God.

679
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,908
What time is it?

680
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,015
5:00, I think.

681
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,657
I've been very sick,

682
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,317
but I feel better now.

683
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,418
Poor Minus.

684
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,393
Karin, my darling.

685
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,657
- I want to talk to Papa alone.
- Let's go home.

686
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,328
I must talk to Papa
before it starts again.

687
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,236
- Karin, dear.
- Please!

688
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,914
I'll go and call an ambulance.

689
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,023
Please go and get my medicine bag.

690
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,027
I'll have to give her a shot.

691
01:08:32,851 --> 01:08:34,729
- Papa.
- What?

692
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:39,972
I want to stay at the hospital now.
I don't want any more treatments.

693
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,181
Can you tell them no more of those?

694
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,920
I don't know.

695
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:50,552
I can't live in two worlds.
I have to choose.

696
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,929
I can't keep going back and forth
between one and the other.

697
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,775
It can't go on.

698
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,607
What?

699
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,146
The hatred.

700
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,411
What hatred?

701
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,726
I didn't do it of my own free will.

702
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,560
A voice told me what to do.

703
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,326
The voice told you to read my diary.

704
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:40,534
It also told you
to tell Martin what you read.

705
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:49,214
I've done worse than that.

706
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,223
Much worse.

707
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:05,293
I tried to resist,
but I couldn't get away.

708
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,930
I was forced to do it.

709
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,031
When was this?

710
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,770
Just now.

711
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,848
Poor little Minus.

712
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:30,156
I just don't understand!

713
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,727
Try to stay calm, Karin.

714
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,324
And then the room
with the people waiting.

715
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,600
Those good, bright-faced people
waiting for the door to open...

716
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,138
for God to come to them.

717
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,441
Then the voices start...

718
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:00,115
and I have to do as they say.

719
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,392
I can't make sense of it all.

720
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,422
Is it really just my illness?

721
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,851
Papa...

722
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:15,603
It's so horrible to see your own
confusion and understand it.

723
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,613
I want to apologize to you.

724
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,920
I've always had a guilty conscience
about you, so I turned away.

725
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:48,259
It makes me sick to think of the life
I sacrificed to my so-called art.

726
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:52,530
I first became successful
around the time your mother died.

727
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,666
It meant more to me than her death.

728
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:59,705
I was secretly rejoicing, yet I loved
your mother in my own confused way.

729
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,513
When I fell ill,
you went to Switzerland.

730
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,578
I couldn't bear that you had inherited
your mother's illness, so I fled.

731
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,948
I had to finish my novel.

732
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,690
Is it any good?

733
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,328
You see, Karin...

734
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,236
one draws a magic circle
around oneself

735
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:29,070
to keep everything out
that doesn't fit one's secret games.

736
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,103
Each time life breaks
through the circle,

737
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,445
the games become
puny and ridiculous.

738
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,755
So one draws a new circle
and builds new defenses.

739
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,388
Poor little Papa.

740
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:50,625
Yes, poor little Papa,
forced to live in reality.

741
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:09,775
Let's go home now.

742
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,515
I have to pack.

743
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:30,165
- When will the ambulance be here?
- About an hour.

744
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,568
I just want to get changed and pack.

745
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,912
Thanks. I can manage.

746
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,557
The light is so strong.

747
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,000
You must help Minus
with his Latin, Papa.

748
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,234
I already thought of it.

749
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,636
We mustn't forget
the keys to our place in town.

750
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,271
The doorman's on vacation.

751
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,840
- Aren't you coming back here?
- No, I'll stay in town.

752
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,386
I think that's best.

753
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,724
We didn't get to pick any mushrooms.

754
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,663
- Will you help me pack, Martin?
- Of course.

755
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,315
Minus!

756
01:14:36,144 --> 01:14:37,128
Minus!

757
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,798
I want to talk to you.

758
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:40,223
Minus!

759
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,538
Come here now, Minus.

760
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,793
Your shirts are washed
but not ironed.

761
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,335
I'll wear this.
I've got shirts in town anyway.

762
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,301
Can you help me close this, please?

763
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:23,574
It's the shoes.
I'll leave them here.

764
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,381
Wear these instead and leave those.

765
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,914
I'm taking them to the shoemaker's.

766
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,824
Have you got something
for a headache?

767
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,397
- I thought I put my bag in here.
- No, it's in the kitchen.

768
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,359
So it is.

769
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,188
Have you seen Karin?

770
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,352
No.

771
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,708
<i>I came as quickly as I could,
but it wasn't easy.

772
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:04,009
<i>There are many who would stop me.

773
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,517
<i>I'm so happy.

774
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,058
<i>Yes, I understand.

775
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,300
<i>I understand.

776
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:25,497
<i>Yes.

777
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,808
<i>That's good.

778
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,704
Yes, I understand.

779
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,615
Yes, I understand.

780
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,679
I know it won't be long now.

781
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,152
It's a great comfort to know that.

782
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,363
But our waiting
has been a time of joy.

783
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,701
Martin, walk quietly.

784
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:56,499
They say he'll be here
any moment now.

785
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,002
We must be ready.

786
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:00,836
We're going to town.

787
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,907
I can't go now.
Don't you see?

788
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,639
You're mistaken, Karin.

789
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,947
Nothing is happening in there.

790
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,486
No god is going to walk
through that door.

791
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:20,994
He'll be here any moment now,
and I must be here.

792
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,690
Dearest Karin, it's not true.

793
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,724
If you can't be quiet,
you'd best leave.

794
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,463
Come now.

795
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:31,402
Why must you spoil it?

796
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:34,066
Go away and let me have
this moment alone.

797
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,536
Dearest Martin,

798
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,105
I'm sorry I was so mean just now.

799
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:17,875
Couldn't you kneel down next to me
and put your hands together?

800
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:23,015
You look so funny
and conspicuous sitting there.

801
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,053
I know you don't believe...

802
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,287
but for my sake, Martin.

803
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,799
My love.

804
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,140
My love.

805
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:48,145
My love.

806
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,087
Hold her legs.

807
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,046
Calm down, Karin.

808
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,120
I was frightened.

809
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,194
The door opened.

810
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,195
But the god
that came out was a spider.

811
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,342
He came towards me...

812
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,469
and I saw his face.

813
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,611
It was a terrible, stony face.

814
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:43,522
He crawled up and tried
to force himself into me,

815
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,890
but I defended myself.

816
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,823
The whole time I saw his eyes.

817
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,358
They were cold and calm.

818
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,470
When he couldn't penetrate me,

819
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,671
he continued up my chest...

820
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:09,145
up onto my face
and on up the wall.

821
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,992
I have seen God.

822
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:45,417
Wait by the jetty.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

823
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,356
They'll be waiting by the jetty.

824
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,826
I'm scared, Papa.

825
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:18,230
When I sat holding Karin
down in the wreck,

826
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:20,194
reality burst open.

827
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,292
Do you understand what I mean?

828
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,662
Yes, I understand.

829
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,897
Reality burst open...

830
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,338
and I tumbled out.

831
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,667
It's like in a dream.

832
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,810
Anything can happen.

833
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:34,845
Anything.

834
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:37,911
I know.

835
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,754
I can't live in this new world.

836
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,413
Yes, you can,

837
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,918
but you must have something
to hold on to.

838
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:47,057
What would that be?

839
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,555
A god?

840
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,689
Give me some proof of God.

841
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,135
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

842
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,963
But you have to listen carefully.

843
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:03,840
Yes, I need to listen.

844
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:07,846
I can only give you
a hint of my own hope.

845
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,815
It's knowing that love exists
for real in the human world.

846
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:16,349
- A special kind of love, I suppose?
- All kinds, Minus.

847
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:20,291
The highest and the lowest,
the most absurd and the most sublime.

848
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:22,953
All kinds of love.

849
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,422
The longing for love?

850
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,565
Longing and denial.

851
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,669
Trust and distrust.

852
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:34,372
So love is the proof?

853
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,707
I don't know if love
is proof of God's existence,

854
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,813
or if love is God himself.

855
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:46,108
For you, love and God are the same.

856
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:51,190
That thought helps me
in my emptiness and my dirty despair.

857
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:54,657
Tell me more, Papa.

858
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:58,455
Suddenly the emptiness
turns into abundance,

859
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,295
and despair into life.

860
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,260
It's like a reprieve, Minus,

861
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,603
from a death sentence.

862
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,943
Papa, if it is as you say,

863
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,239
then Karin is surrounded by God,
since we love her.

864
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:16,684
Yes.

865
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,411
Can that help her?

866
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,014
I believe so.

867
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,760
Would you mind if I go for a run?

868
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,329
Off you go. I'll make dinner.

869
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,596
See you in an hour.

870
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,676
Papa spoke to me.
