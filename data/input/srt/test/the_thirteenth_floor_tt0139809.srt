1
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,154
<i>They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

2
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,116
<i>For the first time
in my life, I agree.</i>

3
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:14,868
<i>I wish...</i>

4
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,997
<i>I had never uncovered
the awful truth.</i>

5
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,082
<i>I know now...</i>

6
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:25,045
<i>once they find out,
they will try to silence me.</i>

7
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:30,425
<i>That is why I've written this
all down for you in this letter.</i>

8
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:33,595
<i>You are the only one
whom I can tell this to.</i>

9
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:37,933
<i>The only one who could
possibly understand.</i>

10
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:41,686
<i>Good luck, my friend.</i>

11
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,396
I hope you enjoyed your stay, Mr. Fuller.

12
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,052
Table is ready, right this way

13
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,613
Mr. Fuller, nice having you here.

14
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:35,740
Your usual table?

15
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,618
No, thanks, Gene.

16
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,440
Her name is Erika.

17
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:13,945
She's from Toledo.

18
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,491
Ashton, would you do me a favor?

19
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,076
You'd like to meet her?

20
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,995
I want you...

21
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,915
to keep this letter.

22
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:28,877
Somebody will ask for it.
A man named Douglas Hall.

23
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:33,965
Remember, it's crucial
that he receives it.

24
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,218
It's a walk in the park.

25
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,398
Going home, Mr. Fuller?

26
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,233
Yes, Charlie.

27
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,803
We're out of cat food, honey.

28
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,097
Yes, I'll buy some in the morning.

29
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,437
You've been smoking again.

30
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:16,419
Download complete.

31
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,672
Link to simulation terminated.

32
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,167
Martini, please.

33
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,262
One martini.

34
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,347
You forgot the olive.

35
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,016
We're out of olives.

36
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:13,935
How about pretzels?

37
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,979
No, thank you.

38
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,951
Please leave a message at the tone.

39
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,453
Douglas, it's me.

40
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,833
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

41
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,543
This changes everything.

42
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,269
I don't know....

43
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:00,481
I don't even know how to begin.

44
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,195
What are you doing?

45
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:21,878
<i>You have new messages.</i>

46
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:39,187
<i>You have new messages.</i>

47
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,655
<i>You have 3 new messages.</i>

48
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,824
<i>First new message: 5:25 a.m.</i>

49
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:55,870
<i>Douglas, it's Hilary.
Don't forget to call Marshall.</i>

50
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,164
<i>Legal has been screaming
for the contract for over a month.</i>

51
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:01,751
<i>I'll have a notary come
to the office at lunch.</i>

52
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:04,629
<i>Next new message: 5:48 a.m.</i>

53
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:10,093
<i>It's me again.
Please call me as soon as you get up.</i>

54
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:14,013
<i>Next new message: 6:13 a.m.</i>

55
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,934
<i>Mr. Douglas Hall,
this is Detective McBain, LAPD.</i>

56
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,144
<i>I'd appreciate a callback, please.</i>

57
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:23,856
<i>My phone number is 555-7876.</i>

58
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:41,291
I'm Detective Zev Bernstein.

59
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,002
Sorry to drag you
out of bed so early.

60
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,754
This is Detective McBain.

61
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,801
Mr. Hall?

62
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,678
Thanks for coming down.

63
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,138
Where is he?

64
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:58,266
-Can I get you some coffee?
-No, thank you.

65
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,978
That him?

66
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,328
We found him in an alley
at Spring and Grand.

67
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:22,665
Yeah, Looks like he ran into some guy
who wasn't just asking for a quarter.

68
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,542
Carved him up like a Christmas ham.

69
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:27,128
Took everything:
wallet, credit cards.

70
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:29,380
Got a kick out of it.

71
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,675
What's your connection
to the old man?

72
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,345
I worked with him for 6 years.

73
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,430
He was my boss.

74
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,808
My friend.

75
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,980
Hey, cigarette?

76
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,985
I don't smoke.

77
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,113
We found these on him.

78
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:57,492
Traced the prescription.
According to his doctor...

79
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:01,496
Fuller listed you as a person to call
in case of any medical emergency.

80
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,498
He had no next of kin?

81
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,792
No, he didn't.

82
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:07,293
You sure?

83
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:09,754
I think he would've told me.

84
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,256
Have any idea who killed him?

85
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,593
Everybody liked him.

86
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,266
Mind if I tag along?

87
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:28,106
Or we can continue in my office,
if that's more convenient.

88
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:30,608
That's fine.

89
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,033
What do you do
for a paycheck, anyway?

90
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:40,618
Computer software.

91
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:43,830
Would you mind taking care
of the car this morning?

92
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,500
-Must make some decent bucks, huh?
-I make a living.

93
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:51,963
-This was his apartment.
-You could be home already.

94
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:57,176
I see these signs
every time I leave work:

95
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:00,847
"You could be home already.
Apartment living in downtown."

96
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,893
Never expected it could look
anything like this.

97
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:09,647
This company was Fuller's life.
He worked and lived here.

98
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:13,151
So what exactly
do you people do here?

99
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,821
You wouldn't be interested.

100
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm paid to be interested.

101
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,284
Computer research.

102
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,495
Fuller was onto...

103
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,623
a whole new frontier.

104
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,251
Very sensitive material.

105
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,086
Not at liberty to discuss it.

106
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:36,215
A lot of money involved.

107
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,635
This apartment must be worth
a few million dollars.

108
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:42,680
One of the perks of the job.

109
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,271
This job has a whole lot of perks.

110
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,448
Can I help you?

111
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,547
I just talked to him 2 days ago.

112
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,010
I can't believe he's gone.

113
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,557
My name is Jane Fuller.

114
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:27,975
Hannon was my father.

115
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,023
I'm sorry.
I'm Douglas Hall.

116
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:39,320
You're the one
he always wanted me to meet.

117
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:42,365
He never mentioned
that he had a daughter.

118
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:44,700
He didn't?

119
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:51,165
I arrived from Paris this morning.
I was supposed to meet him.

120
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:53,459
But then I heard.

121
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,836
My condolences, Miss Fuller.

122
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,838
I'm Detective McBain, LAPD.

123
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,258
I have to ask you some questions.

124
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,220
-Of course.
-Would you excuse us, Mr. Hall?

125
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:07,848
Sure.

126
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,107
Have we ever met before?

127
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:20,653
No, that's not possible.

128
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:24,240
You look very familiar.

129
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,076
Nice to meet you, Miss Fuller.

130
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,118
Hey, Whitney.
How you doing?

131
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,288
Sliced him up like an animal.

132
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,750
And for what?

133
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,796
He was the Einstein of our generation.
It's a waste.

134
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,802
What the hell happened
while I was away?

135
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:32,099
He was jacking
into the system a lot.

136
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:36,228
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?

137
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,648
We're months away
from the first trial run.

138
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,901
We are. You know, he was
taking a big chance.

139
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:45,363
What was I supposed to do?
You know how he is.

140
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,117
Were there complications?

141
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:51,994
None that I know of yet.

142
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,417
Did he ever tell you
he had a daughter?

143
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:02,296
-Why?
-Because I just met her.

144
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,006
You're kidding me.

145
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,524
John, I need the number
of that cab company.

146
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,025
No need, sir.

147
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,069
She went to the Omni Hotel.

148
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,751
Detective McBain.

149
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,212
Sorry to disappoint you.

150
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:44,714
I'll find Doug.

151
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:47,383
Actually it was you I wanted
to have a few words with.

152
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:49,844
What for?

153
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,263
Well you want me to catch the guy
who killed your boss, don't you?

154
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,306
Of course.

155
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,269
The whole thing's
a giant computer game?

156
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,606
No, it doesn't need a user
to interact with it to function.

157
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:06,402
Its units are fully formed,
self-learning cyber beings.

158
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:09,530
-Units?
-Electronic, simulated characters.

159
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,949
They populate the system.

160
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,284
They think...

161
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:14,744
they work...

162
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,203
they eat.

163
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:17,705
They fuck?

164
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,251
Let's just say that
they're modeled after us.

165
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:26,797
Right now, we have a working
prototype: Los Angeles, circa 1937.

166
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:28,466
Why '37?

167
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,887
Fuller wanted to start by re-creating
the era of his youth.

168
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:34,305
You see...

169
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,267
while my mind is jacked in...

170
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,314
I'm walking around experiencing 1937.

171
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,274
My body stays here...

172
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:49,695
and holds the consciousness
of the program link unit.

173
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:53,199
You think one of them units
crawled up an extension cord...

174
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,784
and killed its maker?

175
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,249
Miss Fuller checked in yet?

176
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,088
Miss Fuller.

177
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,634
Glad I caught you.

178
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:13,302
Mr. Hall.

179
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:16,597
What are you doing here?

180
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,433
It's about your father, actually.

181
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:22,353
You said you spoke with him
a few days ago.

182
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:26,482
Can you tell me anything
about that conversation?

183
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:30,194
Did he seem strange to you at all?

184
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:35,825
He'd been under
a lot of stress lately.

185
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:40,204
He asked me to fly to the States,
so I could help with the company.

186
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,039
Help him run it?

187
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,792
Shut it down.

188
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:51,715
I worked with him for 6 years.
If he wanted to shut it down...

189
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,093
he would've told me about it.

190
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:57,555
He didn't tell you about me.

191
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:07,147
But I wish he had.

192
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,291
It's nice to see you again.

193
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:29,044
Sorry I'm late. Have you looked
through the paperwork?

194
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:33,007
Yes, I have. And I think
we have a very strong case.

195
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,593
The company should be
yours in no time.

196
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,596
-Strong case?
-What I'm saying is, your father...

197
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:41,765
changed his will in favor of the employees.

198
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:45,394
In fact, you aren't mentioned
in the original will either.

199
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:49,023
But as I said, I think
we have a very strong case.

200
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,359
Who will head the board now?

201
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:54,028
Douglas Hall.

202
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,162
Not bad.

203
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,956
Owner of a $2 billion enterprise.

204
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,210
Strange, Fuller would amend
his will just before he died.

205
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,922
I was on an airplane
when it happened.

206
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:18,218
According to the security guard,
Fuller left the office at 10:30 p.m.

207
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:20,387
30 minutes after your plane arrived.

208
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,310
Autopsy shows that
he died around midnight.

209
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:30,564
-You had time to catch up with him.
-But I didn't.

210
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:35,861
-I went straight home.
-Didn't talk to him?

211
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:39,323
No e-mails, no faxes,
not even a message?

212
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:40,574
None of the above.

213
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,869
You know, that's funny.

214
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,747
We checked Fuller's phone records.

215
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,292
He made a call with
his calling card at 11:02 p.m.

216
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:54,505
Shit!

217
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:57,591
Your home number.

218
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:05,140
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave town for a couple of days.

219
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,477
And get that game fixed.

220
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,062
It's missing a spring.

221
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:23,534
You have no new--

222
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,786
Restore. Restore.

223
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:30,416
To restore messages,
press "rewind" now.

224
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:34,712
-Yesterday at 2:45 p.m.
-I managed to reschedule--

225
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,882
-Yesterday at 5:14 p.m.
-Hello, Mr. Hall--

226
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:43,178
-Yesterday at 11:02 p.m.
-Douglas, it's me.

227
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:46,640
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

228
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,350
This changes everything.

229
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:52,271
I'm here in some bar on Main and 7th.

230
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,650
In case something happens to me,
I left you a message in the system.

231
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,527
I gave it to--

232
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,821
How did you find me?

233
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,429
What's going on?

234
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:28,974
I'm trying to get
into Fuller's files.

235
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,060
For what?

236
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:34,563
He left a message for me
the night he died.

237
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:40,194
-He knew someone wanted to kill him.
-Did you tell the police?

238
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,987
-No.
-Why not?

239
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:45,866
He also said he left a message
for me in the system.

240
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:48,827
Douglas, please.
This is my stuff, okay?

241
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:00,547
These are the units that Fuller
interacted with when he was there.

242
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:03,967
Maybe he wanted me to go in.

243
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:09,890
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking...

244
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,309
don't even think about it.

245
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:13,519
I need your help.

246
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:16,063
No, no, no. I won't help you.

247
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,732
-It's a serious risk.
-I have to get in.

248
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:22,152
You could die.

249
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,113
The cops think I killed him.

250
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:28,867
They may be right.

251
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:31,537
-What do you mean?
-Everything points to me.

252
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,627
To be perfectly honest,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

253
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:44,174
Either I did murder Fuller and
I can't remember, or I'm being framed.

254
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,261
The one clue I have is in that machine.

255
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,556
I need your help
if I'm going to find it.

256
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:58,397
I'll set it for an hour.

257
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:04,444
Set it for 120 minutes.

258
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:05,904
60 is better.

259
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:07,573
120 minutes, Whit.

260
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,200
60 is safer. I'm setting it at 60.

261
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:12,744
1-2-0.

262
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:26,049
<i>120 minutes. Engage timer.</i>

263
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:53,410
Mr. Grierson,
117 West Winston, Pasadena....

--5 cents!

267
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:40,123
You owe me 12 dollars and 5 cents.

268
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:43,168
Listen, young man!

269
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,920
I do not have all day!

270
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,677
Ferguson, anything wrong?

271
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:54,596
John, are you okay?

272
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:16,910
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Someone will be right with you.

273
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, my God.

274
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:04,458
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks. Don't smoke.

275
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,003
Since when?

276
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,089
Listen, John...

277
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,425
why don't you....

278
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,511
Why don't you break for lunch?

279
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:18,722
Get some fresh air.

280
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,767
You look terrible.

281
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,694
I think I look pretty good.

282
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:51,797
Extra! Extra!
Zeppelin blast kills 35!

283
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:57,803
You want one, mister?
It's 5 cents.

284
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:06,645
Hey, watch out, buddy!

285
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,323
-How much to Pasadena?
-90 cents.

286
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,827
-If I forget to turn the meter on.
-I understand.

287
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,805
This is it, 117 Winston.

288
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:45,267
-Do you mind waiting?
-It'll be a pleasure, sir.

289
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,709
-Tell me if you need any help.
-Thank you.

290
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,432
You own this place?

291
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,394
I mean, it's not much...

292
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:31,480
but it's mine.

293
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:42,657
You looking for anything
in particular?

294
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:45,952
Interested in a scientist.

295
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,247
Wrote a couple of books...

296
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,376
about semiconductors...

297
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:56,004
and the limitations
of the 64-bit microchip.

298
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:57,964
Microchip.

299
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:00,383
Semiconductors.

300
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,427
What year?

301
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,097
Early '70s?

302
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:08,183
His name was Hannon Fuller.

303
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:10,060
Hannon Fuller.

304
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:12,395
1870.

305
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,942
No, I can't say I've ever heard of...

306
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:21,488
Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.

307
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:26,326
But I'm not much of a
technical person, you know.

308
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:33,542
You been here before?
You look kind of familiar.

309
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,378
Name's Douglas Hall.

310
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:43,677
It doesn't ring a bell.

311
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,306
Guess you just have
one of those faces...

312
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,934
familiar faces. Oh, it's late.

313
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,687
I'd like to close up now.

314
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,689
Of course.

315
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,985
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hall.

316
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:38,023
1257 Palo Alto Road,
La Cienega Heights.

317
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,858
I guess that's it.

318
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,282
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

319
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,867
What do you want her for?

320
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:53,705
-I want to ask her some questions.
-She got a job now. I'm her mother.

321
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,915
Can you tell me
where I can find her?

322
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,001
You a copper?

323
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:01,755
Now, listen.

324
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,549
She ain't doing
nothing wrong no more.

325
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,010
If you don't cause her no trouble...

326
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,096
you'll find her at Wilshire Grand Hotel.

327
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:07,028
Welcome to the Wilshire Grand Hotel.

328
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,834
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

329
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:23,628
She's over there,
second from the end.

330
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:30,969
Bridget?

331
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,807
I got your name from
a good friend of mine.

332
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,268
Come back later.
I'm really busy right now.

333
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,561
His name's Fuller.

334
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:44,482
The manager's very tough on us.
You'll have to wait till I'm off duty.

335
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,945
I really don't think
I can wait that long.

336
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,699
Go talk to Ashton over at the bar.

337
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,496
Bridget, do we have
your attention now?

338
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,957
Thank you. Let's go.

339
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,169
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ashton.

340
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:05,920
Right there.

341
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,798
Ashton, some guy wants you.

342
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,510
You're a lucky man.
I just opened.

343
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,516
Oh, my. Something wrong?

344
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,979
Bridget just sent me over here.

345
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:25,023
What can I do you for?

346
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,818
You know a gentleman
named Hannon Fuller?

347
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,572
Gin martini up, one olive and
likes them frigid as an Eskimo.

348
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,658
-Talk to him recently?
-Why?

349
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,495
I'm his friend.
He didn't come home last night...

350
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:41,873
and his wife is concerned.
My name is Douglas Hall.

351
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,173
Concerned wives?

352
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,467
I can't help you with that.

353
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,552
How about something fancy?

354
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,721
So did....

355
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,432
Does Fuller come here frequently?

356
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:00,934
You could say that.

357
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,185
What does he do?

358
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,438
What everybody does:
drinks, dances, has a good time.

359
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,774
Especially has a good time.

360
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:10,026
He really goes for the girls.

361
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,070
Girls?

362
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,198
Thought you said you knew him.

363
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,867
Yeah, I thought I did.

364
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,205
Are you in a hurry or something?

365
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:26,334
Did you happen to talk to Fuller
the night before last?

366
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:28,294
Yes, I did.

367
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,298
Did he mention my name?
Did he give you something for me?

368
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,675
What would that be?

369
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,594
-A message or a note, maybe.
-No, sorry.

370
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,222
Did you see him talking
to anybody else?

371
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:41,724
I'm a very busy man.

372
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,066
Listen...

373
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,070
if you like, I can arrange
something for you too.

374
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:58,074
You see anything you want?

375
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,627
Can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

376
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:29,230
<i>Timer engaged and counting.</i>

377
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,975
Douglas Hall! Hey, man!

378
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,894
You all right?

379
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:12,190
You sure? All right, take it easy.

380
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,986
Hey, man. Take it easy.

381
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:20,490
I told you, 120 minutes.

382
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,785
It's too long.
You're really pushing your luck.

383
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,996
I need something to drink.
Some water.

384
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,502
Mr. Hall, you forgot
your coat and hat.

385
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,722
Name's Ferguson.
Johnny Ferguson.

386
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:52,397
Anything wrong?

387
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:55,274
Didn't finish your drink.

388
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,945
-What happened?
-What happened?

389
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,614
The memory transference
with your link...

390
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,741
it froze. Started overlapping!

391
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:08,538
Thought I'd be shooting hoops
with Ferguson forever.

392
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,873
You got a smoke?

393
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,667
Sure.

394
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:14,836
Thank you.

395
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,428
Mind if I ask you a question?

396
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,348
Can you tell me where I am?

397
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,520
It works?

398
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,273
Oh, it works!

399
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,277
It works.

400
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,821
How about Ashton?

401
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:45,074
-My bartender?
-He's got a better haircut than you.

402
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:46,576
Much better.

403
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,329
I wish I could see it for myself.

404
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,083
How's the lighting? Textures?

405
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:57,962
Colorization needs work,
but the units don't notice.

406
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,172
What are they like?

407
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,634
They're as real as you and me.

408
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,473
You see, the old man was right!
All those years of work!

409
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,434
Did you find out
what he was doing there?

410
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,978
He was having sex with girls.

411
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,607
You're kidding me.

412
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,359
Excuse me, Mr. Hall?

413
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,196
A man in the lobby says
he needs to talk to you.

414
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,115
Thanks. Have him call
my office in the morning.

415
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,494
He says it's urgent.
That he's a friend of Fuller's.

416
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,471
So, you're a friend of Fuller's.

417
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,182
You're Hall, right?

418
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,683
How can I help you, Mr....

419
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,519
Tom Jones.

420
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,021
You know, like the singer.

421
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,317
How about some privacy?

422
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,945
What do you want to talk about?

423
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,906
About the night the old man died.

424
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,828
I'll be right back, Joe.

425
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,047
So where'd you meet Fuller?

426
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,049
In my bar the other night...

427
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,926
waiting for you.

428
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:32,682
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

429
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,353
No, I want to talk about money now.

430
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:41,065
-Something in the 7 figures.
-What money?

431
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,734
Come on.

432
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,280
You think you can
get away with it?

433
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:48,656
Get away with what?

434
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,290
You took the old man, asshole!

435
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,960
Listen to me.
He was at the bar.

436
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,505
You pick him up, leave together.
Next day he's an obit.

437
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,716
You do the math, asshole!

438
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,559
Oh, Jesus!

439
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,689
Crazy son of a bitch!

440
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,026
You're nuts.

441
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,905
I'll see you on
America's Most Wanted.

442
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,092
Omni Hotel.
How can I help you?

443
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:52,470
Miss Jane Fuller, please.

444
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,349
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

445
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,813
On the night
your father was killed...

446
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,066
he tried to reach me.

447
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,068
He wanted to meet at some bar.

448
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,653
What for?

449
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,905
He felt someone was after him.

450
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,782
Did you talk to him?

451
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,994
I know how strange this sounds.

452
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,329
I can't remember.

453
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,665
What do you mean?

454
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,711
Did you talk to
the detective about this?

455
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,422
No, but the bartender will...

456
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,133
if I don't pay up.

457
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,177
Christ!

458
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,930
I know how crazy this sounds.

459
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:39,141
You can't just plug your brain
into this machine...

460
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:41,352
and not expect to be affected by it.

461
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:47,233
Please walk away from this
before you get hurt too.

462
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,696
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

463
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,617
Maybe we have, in another life.

464
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,454
What about Paris?
What's that other life like?

465
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,457
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Why not?

466
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,003
I guess I don't want you
to lose interest in me.

467
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:10,965
Don't worry about that.

468
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:15,886
Let's dance.

469
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,472
-Me? No, no.
-Yes, come on.

470
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,808
I buy all my shoes in left pairs.

471
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,561
It's easy. I'll show you the steps.

472
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,539
You're doing pretty good
for a man with no right foot.

473
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:47,084
Must've picked it up in another life.

474
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:01,140
You know that feeling you have
that we met before?

475
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,606
It's the same with me.

476
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,066
Why is that?

477
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,527
They say that déjà vu
is usually a sign of...

478
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:16,447
love at first sight.

479
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:00,282
Go, go. Ready!

480
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,579
Don't make any sudden moves.

481
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,957
What's this all about?

482
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,875
What it's usually all about.

483
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,710
Murder.

484
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,421
Is that your car?

485
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,881
-Those are my plates.
-No shit.

486
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:19,051
That's from a security camera
in your office garage...

487
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:22,054
-the night Fuller was killed.
-I don't understand.

488
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,014
That makes one of us.

489
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:28,436
Fuller wanted to shut down the project,
and you sliced him up.

490
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,062
It's time I call my attorney.

491
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,439
You say you left at 10.

492
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,732
I was working late with Whitney.

493
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:35,693
Anybody with you?

494
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,742
You're picking up bad habits
left and right.

495
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,830
Must be the stress.

496
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,748
Then you'll need a carton.

497
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,045
Name's Tom Jones. Said he saw
your picture in the paper.

498
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:59,467
Said you looked like the guy
Fuller left the bar with that night.

499
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:03,429
We took his statement.
Said we'd be in touch.

500
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,307
Somebody reached out
and touched him first.

501
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,663
Looks like you found an alibi.

502
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,216
You're free to go...

503
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:42,051
for now.

504
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:49,850
What did you tell him?

505
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:51,435
The truth.

506
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,146
We met for a drink,
one thing led to another...

507
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,858
we spent the night together.
Your picture was on the news.

508
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,819
He saw you and thought
you were good for quick cash.

509
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:03,656
You should've seen the pictures.
The guy was slaughtered.

510
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,450
He was an ex-con.
Who knows what else he did!

511
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:10,329
Just because I don't remember it
doesn't mean I didn't do it.

512
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:11,956
You're not a killer.

513
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,875
Your father stumbled onto something.

514
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,711
He left me a message
having something to do with this.

515
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,713
So what are you going to do?

516
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:21,882
Jack back in and find out.

517
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,852
<i>Downloading. Time: 2 hours.</i>

518
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:36,438
<i>Engage timer.</i>

519
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,984
<i>Timer not engaged. Warning!</i>

520
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:43,487
<i>Timer not engaged.</i>

521
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:44,947
<i>Warning.</i>

522
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,539
We're up next!

523
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,591
-Ready? Come on.
-What?!

524
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:08,971
What's wrong?

525
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:10,514
Come on, John!

526
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,185
What are you doing?

527
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:20,316
We're gonna be disqualified!

528
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,830
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot, chief.

529
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:52,139
Come on!

530
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:55,517
Grierson!

531
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,656
I'll call the police!

532
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,658
-I need to talk to you!
-I told you!

533
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,159
I'll call the police!

534
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,911
Listen. Listen!

535
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,580
I know why you pass out
from time to time.

536
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,917
I know why you wake up
and have no idea where you are.

537
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:23,045
What'd you do 3 nights ago?
Any idea?

538
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,802
When did it first happen?

539
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:31,261
First time?

540
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:34,890
About 4 weeks ago.

541
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,851
And the last episode
was 3 nights ago?

542
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:41,355
It lasts for about 2 hours?

543
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:46,985
My wife thinks
I have a secret love life.

544
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,279
What about...

545
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:54,451
memory flashes, déjà vu?

546
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,911
I was in World War I.

547
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:59,331
I'm still having these nightmares.

548
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,208
I'm talking about fantasies.

549
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:07,047
I do have them.

550
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,552
In these fantasies,
you're having sex with young girls.

551
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,309
When I wake up...

552
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,480
I even have a perfume smell...

553
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:27,151
-all over me.
-Real or imagined?

554
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:32,030
According to my wife...

555
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,492
it's pretty real.

556
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:03,979
I found this...

557
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,231
a couple of days ago.

558
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:07,483
Your size?

559
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:11,236
I am married over 35 years now.

560
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:17,034
And not once have I cheated
on my wife.

561
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,787
Not once.

562
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:22,414
Let's have a drink.

563
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,772
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

564
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:42,752
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

565
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:46,844
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

566
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,997
You been here before?

567
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,168
I can't afford places like this.

568
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,671
My treat.

569
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,760
Good evening, Mr. Fuller.

570
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,262
That's you.

571
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:22,140
Good evening.

572
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,562
-Nice to see you again.
-Good to see you too.

573
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,690
Members only.

574
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:33,026
-Mr. Fuller, your usual table?
-Of course.

575
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,279
He's with me.

576
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,781
May I help you with that?

577
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,673
Hi, honey bear.
I'll be with you in 5 minutes.

578
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:06,560
Let's talk, "honey bear."

579
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:23,869
You remember her?

580
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,164
Of course not.
She's mistaken me for someone else.

581
00:53:27,373 --> 00:53:28,457
Your martini.

582
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,251
For someone else.

583
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,463
I want you to look around
and tell me what you remember.

584
00:53:34,672 --> 00:53:35,881
I don't know.

585
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,884
I'd rather go home.
I don't feel very well.

586
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:42,554
You have the feeling
you've been here before?

587
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:45,557
Please try to remember.

588
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:48,560
Do you recognize anybody?

589
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:49,978
I'm trying.

590
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,864
Her? What's her name?

591
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:05,744
I think her name....

592
00:54:08,122 --> 00:54:10,958
Erika, I believe.
I believe her name is Erika.

593
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:12,209
Did you talk to her?

594
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:13,377
I'm not sure.

595
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:19,174
And that one looks familiar too.

596
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,638
Bridget.
Her name's Bridget!

597
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,643
Bridget. Oh, yes.

598
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:33,981
I remember Bridget.

599
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,483
Did you give her
something to give me?

600
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:39,069
Did you give her
a letter or a note?

601
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:43,782
The man behind the bar....

602
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:47,661
You're right.

603
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,998
I wrote a letter,
and I gave it to him.

604
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:52,457
To him!

605
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:49,639
You looking for
anything special?

606
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:53,894
What are you?

607
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:58,398
My name's Ferguson.

608
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,358
I'm a bank teller.

609
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:02,360
I'm Clark Gable.

610
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:05,322
I talked to the Ferguson guy.

611
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:06,823
He doesn't know a thing.

612
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,492
I need to talk to Fuller.

613
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,328
-He's upstairs.
-Cut the crap!

614
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:16,166
You think I don't know what's
going on? I need to talk to him again.

615
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,459
You read the letter.

616
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,338
I need to know what's in it.

617
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,257
Everything.

618
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:27,719
When I read it,
I thought it was a gag.

619
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:29,763
The world's a sham.
Fat chance!

620
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:32,516
But I'm not stupid, Mr. Hall.

621
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,603
I watched you and Ferguson
do the old switcheroo.

622
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:39,689
That stuff about going to
"the ends of the earth."

623
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:41,817
What stuff?

624
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:44,694
I did exactly
what the letter said.

625
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:46,822
I chose a place I'd never go to.

626
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:48,949
I tried to drive to Tucson.

627
00:56:49,158 --> 00:56:50,742
I figured, what the hell.

628
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:53,245
Never been to the countryside.

629
00:56:53,746 --> 00:56:56,248
And I took that car
out on the highway.

630
00:56:56,457 --> 00:56:58,875
I was going over 50
through that desert.

631
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,837
After a while,
I was the only car on the road.

632
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:04,756
It was just me,
the heat and the dust.

633
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:07,008
I did exactly
what the letter said:

634
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:10,971
"Don't follow any road signs
and don't stop for anything.

635
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,848
Not even barricades."

636
00:57:18,312 --> 00:57:22,065
But just when I should've been
getting closer to the city...

637
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:24,734
something wasn't right.

638
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:27,237
There was no movement, no life.

639
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:31,074
Everything was still and quiet.

640
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:35,579
And then I got out of the car.

641
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:38,290
And what I saw...

642
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:42,836
scared me to the depths...

643
00:57:43,045 --> 00:57:44,963
of my miserable soul.

644
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:48,550
It was true.
It was all a sham.

645
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:50,010
It ain't real.

646
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:52,345
Why would Fuller write about...

647
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:55,348
the limitations of the simulation?
I know them.

648
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,058
I'm asking the questions!

649
00:57:57,935 --> 00:57:59,895
I wanna know why.

650
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:03,315
Why would you put us through this?

651
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,859
Why are you fucking
with our minds?

652
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:08,904
-You weren't supposed to find out.
-Well, I did.

653
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,741
Now I want you to show me...

654
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:14,784
what is real.

655
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:19,539
Is this real?

656
00:58:27,673 --> 00:58:29,591
Is that real blood?

657
00:58:34,388 --> 00:58:36,473
You like having
your life fucked with?

658
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:46,358
What the hell's going on?

659
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:12,944
Come on! Come on!

660
01:00:18,743 --> 01:00:20,535
Where's the letter?

661
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:27,644
Snap out of it!

662
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:47,747
Not gonna hit me again, are you?

663
01:01:53,337 --> 01:01:54,379
Did you yank me back?

664
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:57,340
Yeah, barely, man.
Just barely.

665
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,260
You didn't start the timer.
It couldn't engage.

666
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:02,846
What were you doing this
alone for anyway?

667
01:02:03,055 --> 01:02:04,222
He tried to kill me.

668
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:05,932
-Who?
-Ashton.

669
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,642
Jesus!

670
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,938
He found out his world isn't real.
This is a mistake.

671
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,316
This whole project,
this experiment.

672
01:02:15,526 --> 01:02:17,694
We are screwing with people's lives!

673
01:02:17,903 --> 01:02:19,279
Now you're talking crazy.

674
01:02:19,488 --> 01:02:22,282
I know you just had
a bad fucking trip--

675
01:02:22,491 --> 01:02:23,908
"Bad fucking trip"?

676
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:25,535
"Bad fucking trip"?

677
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:30,123
These people are real.
They are as real as you and me.

678
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah, that's because...

679
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:34,461
we designed them that way.

680
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:37,839
In the end, they're just
a bunch of electronic circuits.

681
01:02:38,257 --> 01:02:39,340
Here's something else.

682
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:43,928
I'm shutting this
"bad fucking trip" right down.

683
01:02:44,138 --> 01:02:47,557
-I'm telling everybody tomorrow.
-You can't do that.

684
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:49,309
You can't do that.

685
01:02:49,518 --> 01:02:52,103
You're talking about
6 years of our lives.

686
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:53,313
All of us.

687
01:02:53,522 --> 01:02:57,150
You can't just pull the plug
and go home!

688
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:17,170
I'm looking for Jane Fuller.

689
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:20,965
Sorry, she's no longer with us.

690
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:22,342
The lady vanished.

691
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:26,763
Any idea where to?

692
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:30,683
Why would I?

693
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:32,894
Hannon Fuller doesn't have a daughter.

694
01:03:42,613 --> 01:03:44,948
I think I made the age-old mistake:

695
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,617
"Never trust a beautiful woman."

696
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:49,911
Who is she, then?

697
01:03:50,162 --> 01:03:51,663
We don't know.

698
01:03:51,872 --> 01:03:55,333
It took us a couple of days
to contact the French authorities.

699
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:57,168
Guess what?

700
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:00,964
They never heard of her, either.

701
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:20,775
Do you remember me?

702
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:23,528
Miss Fuller checked out.

703
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:26,573
Did you drive her anywhere?
I'm looking for her.

704
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:29,117
No can do.
Company rules.

705
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:09,198
I'm Douglas Hall.
I'm looking for a young woman...

706
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:11,242
named Jane Fuller.

707
01:05:12,286 --> 01:05:14,579
I think you picked the wrong house.

708
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:18,750
Maybe she's going under
another name. She's about 5'8".

709
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:20,835
Blonde hair.

710
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,338
What do you want from her?

711
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:30,887
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Natasha Molinaro.

712
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:33,139
Over there on register 4.

713
01:05:57,206 --> 01:05:59,248
Here you go. Thank you.

714
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:08,800
$7.01.

715
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:22,980
Just slide it through.

716
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:36,452
You want cash back?

717
01:06:48,507 --> 01:06:51,217
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

718
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:57,348
Must be déjà vu or something.

719
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:01,728
Paper or plastic?

720
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,438
Plastic.

721
01:07:07,776 --> 01:07:09,277
There you go.

722
01:07:42,728 --> 01:07:43,978
Mr. Hall!

723
01:07:51,987 --> 01:07:53,780
You forgot your credit card.

724
01:07:58,368 --> 01:07:59,368
Thanks.

725
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,037
No problem.

726
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:05,500
Sorry about staring at you in there.
You must get that a lot.

727
01:08:07,085 --> 01:08:11,005
Yeah, but mostly from
the wrong kinds of guys.

728
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:16,135
You're not from here, are you?

729
01:08:16,804 --> 01:08:18,721
What makes you ask?

730
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:20,014
Well, it's just....

731
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:24,227
I just had this funny feeling
that we met before.

732
01:08:27,147 --> 01:08:29,148
Maybe in another life.

733
01:08:33,487 --> 01:08:36,364
Yeah, I guess that would explain it.

734
01:08:39,535 --> 01:08:43,120
Anyway, I gotta get back
to my daily grind, so....

735
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,874
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.

736
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:16,422
$7.28.

737
01:10:19,635 --> 01:10:23,679
Out of 10. Here's your change.
Thank you very much.

738
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:28,643
Thank you.

739
01:10:31,813 --> 01:10:33,356
Natasha Molinaro...

740
01:10:33,565 --> 01:10:34,941
27, single.

741
01:10:35,192 --> 01:10:37,526
Changes jobs like
others change underwear.

742
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:41,948
Comes from Austin, Texas.
Made some money modeling.

743
01:10:42,157 --> 01:10:43,908
Left school without a degree.

744
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:47,828
Her roommate has no idea
what she was doing yesterday.

745
01:10:48,038 --> 01:10:51,123
Looks like Molinaro
doesn't have an alibi.

746
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,959
What else did the roommate say?

747
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,836
Says lately, Natasha
hasn't been feeling well.

748
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:58,798
She's been having
some sort of amnesia attacks.

749
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,218
Going out all night,
sleeping all day.

750
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:20,319
Thought she was using drugs.

751
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:22,530
She have a history of drugs?

752
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:24,156
Nope. She's clean.

753
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,284
Hey, Bernie?

754
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:30,579
-Good work.
-Thanks, Chief.

755
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:53,728
Look, I can explain.
I'm sorry.

756
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,106
I need to see you.
Meet me in Fuller's office.

757
01:11:57,315 --> 01:11:58,941
I know the truth.

758
01:12:01,737 --> 01:12:03,320
Where are you?

759
01:12:04,573 --> 01:12:07,074
You could call it
the end of the world.

760
01:12:28,805 --> 01:12:31,849
How many simulated worlds
like this are there?

761
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:33,601
Thousands.

762
01:12:33,935 --> 01:12:37,938
Yours is the only one that ever created
a simulation within the simulation.

763
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:39,857
Something we never expected.

764
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:41,901
So you had to kill Fuller.

765
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:44,820
No. I was sent in after his death.

766
01:12:45,072 --> 01:12:48,240
I was to pretend to be his daughter,
inherit the company...

767
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,868
and shut it down. But he tricked us.

768
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:53,746
He changed his will.

769
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:56,290
If you didn't kill Fuller...

770
01:12:57,626 --> 01:12:58,959
who did?

771
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:19,438
I stabbed him.

772
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:25,903
But it wasn't you.

773
01:13:26,113 --> 01:13:29,240
It was your user.
He downloaded into you.

774
01:13:29,908 --> 01:13:31,492
-Manipulated you.
-Like a puppet.

775
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:33,285
A puppet doesn't have a soul.

776
01:13:33,495 --> 01:13:35,538
I can't have a soul
any more than Fuller.

777
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:36,831
But you do.

778
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:39,667
Fuller did.

779
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,836
I never expected that.

780
01:13:42,045 --> 01:13:45,339
We programmed this world so no one
in it could learn the truth.

781
01:13:45,549 --> 01:13:48,092
And you and Fuller did.

782
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:51,262
Don't you see what that means?

783
01:13:53,014 --> 01:13:56,350
There's just one little flaw
in your thesis.

784
01:14:01,106 --> 01:14:02,982
None of this is real.

785
01:14:05,068 --> 01:14:06,986
You pull the plug...

786
01:14:07,696 --> 01:14:09,280
I disappear.

787
01:14:09,656 --> 01:14:11,574
And nothing I ever say...

788
01:14:12,492 --> 01:14:14,493
nothing I ever do...

789
01:14:15,745 --> 01:14:16,745
will ever matter.

790
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:19,081
Why don't you find my user?

791
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,043
I'm sure he's a much better catch.

792
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:40,060
I told you about my other life.

793
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:42,521
I was referring to my husband.

794
01:14:44,816 --> 01:14:46,609
He's your user.

795
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,987
He killed Fuller.

796
01:14:51,406 --> 01:14:53,490
I'm his program link.

797
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:00,456
A reflection
of his character profile.

798
01:15:00,665 --> 01:15:02,875
I fell in love with a decent man.

799
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:08,505
But he--
Something happened to him.

800
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:14,261
He began to use the simulation
as his own personal playground.

801
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:16,096
Like Fuller with the girls.

802
01:15:16,932 --> 01:15:20,809
He made himself a god,
and it corrupted him.

803
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:24,772
He began to enjoy the killings.

804
01:15:25,815 --> 01:15:28,108
-He became abusive.
-What do you mean?

805
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,486
He said he would kill me.

806
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:36,242
Why?

807
01:15:37,327 --> 01:15:39,203
I fell in love with you.

808
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:44,124
You don't even know me.

809
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:47,044
Yes, I do.

810
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:54,468
From the moment the simulation
was created, I've watched you.

811
01:15:56,096 --> 01:15:57,346
Your kindness...

812
01:15:58,848 --> 01:16:00,349
your integrity.

813
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:06,397
I fell in love with you
before I even met you.

814
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:09,149
How can you love me?

815
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,282
I'm not even real.

816
01:16:18,243 --> 01:16:20,661
You can't fall in love with a dream.

817
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:32,798
You're more real to me than
anything I've ever known.

818
01:16:51,943 --> 01:16:54,194
Preparing user for download...

819
01:16:54,404 --> 01:16:56,280
into simulation.

820
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,450
Program link ready for download.

821
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,785
Transference beginning.

822
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,329
Download complete.

823
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:12,963
Shit!

824
01:17:36,821 --> 01:17:37,946
Shit!

825
01:17:46,664 --> 01:17:47,956
Oh, wow!

826
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:04,723
Nice driving.

827
01:18:08,686 --> 01:18:11,188
There was something in the road...

828
01:18:11,398 --> 01:18:14,900
and I had to swerve and I lost control.

829
01:18:15,652 --> 01:18:17,027
You drunk?

830
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:18,695
I don't drink.

831
01:18:19,197 --> 01:18:20,531
License and registration.

832
01:18:24,327 --> 01:18:27,830
Look, I didn't jack in--
I left it at home.

833
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:31,208
Why don't you look in the glove box?

834
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:41,802
Need a light?

835
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:43,720
Hey, I got it.

836
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:45,431
Here you go.

837
01:18:54,858 --> 01:18:56,817
You ought to get this car looked at.

838
01:18:57,026 --> 01:18:59,570
It's leaking oil.
That could be dangerous.

839
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:02,281
Be a little more careful, huh?

840
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:18,922
You want to turn off the car
and step out, please?

841
01:19:19,132 --> 01:19:21,633
Turn off the car, sir.
Right now, please.

842
01:19:35,064 --> 01:19:37,107
Open the trunk, please, sir.

843
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:51,079
Hands in the air.
Step away from the trunk.

844
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:53,415
Shit, man, it's Douglas!

845
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:54,833
Back up!

846
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:57,127
I said, back the hell up!

847
01:19:57,378 --> 01:19:58,545
Hey, this is a joke!

848
01:19:59,422 --> 01:20:01,048
Watch out!

849
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,310
Sorry to bother you...

850
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:39,813
but Mr. Whitney's in the building...

851
01:21:40,023 --> 01:21:42,190
and he's acting kind of strange.

852
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,443
I'll be right down.

853
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:12,929
Los Angeles Police Department.

854
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:14,973
This is Jane Fuller.

855
01:22:15,892 --> 01:22:18,518
I need to speak
with Detective McBain.

856
01:22:21,397 --> 01:22:23,732
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

857
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:25,901
Or should I say, "Miss Molinaro"?

858
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:09,194
How you doing?

859
01:23:09,404 --> 01:23:12,114
All these pictures,
this is your world?

860
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:21,456
Ashton.

861
01:23:24,794 --> 01:23:28,672
I never imagined
it could be so beautiful.

862
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,881
How'd you do it?

863
01:23:30,717 --> 01:23:34,469
Last thing I remember,
I was dumping Ferguson in the trunk.

864
01:23:36,472 --> 01:23:38,265
Son of a bitch!

865
01:23:40,351 --> 01:23:41,727
He did it.

866
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:44,646
He jacked in.

867
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,774
Who's Jack?

868
01:23:57,034 --> 01:23:59,244
What'd you do to the world?

869
01:24:00,246 --> 01:24:03,248
-Turned it off.
-Well, put it back!

870
01:24:07,462 --> 01:24:08,503
Don't do that!

871
01:24:09,839 --> 01:24:12,382
Put it back! What did I do?

872
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:19,306
Where are you?

873
01:24:30,777 --> 01:24:31,818
Look at this.

874
01:24:32,445 --> 01:24:35,197
You are really a god.

875
01:24:35,573 --> 01:24:38,867
No, Ashton, I'm not really a god.

876
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,995
I'm just like you.

877
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,625
Just a bunch of electricity.

878
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:49,085
What are you talking about?

879
01:24:52,507 --> 01:24:53,924
It's all smoke and mirrors.

880
01:24:54,592 --> 01:24:56,802
Just like your world.

881
01:24:57,512 --> 01:25:00,514
We're nothing but a simulation
on some computer.

882
01:25:01,808 --> 01:25:03,475
It's like a machine.

883
01:25:04,393 --> 01:25:06,019
Like this arcade game.

884
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:09,314
You've got your players
and you put your nickel in.

885
01:25:10,358 --> 01:25:11,650
This one pitches...

886
01:25:11,984 --> 01:25:14,945
this one runs around the bases.

887
01:25:15,822 --> 01:25:17,531
You got a bat, you got a ball.

888
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,616
They play, they score.

889
01:25:19,826 --> 01:25:23,453
Preprogrammed movements
generated by electrical energy.

890
01:25:23,663 --> 01:25:26,081
We've improved
on this model since then.

891
01:25:26,499 --> 01:25:29,000
Now the players can beat
the shit out of...

892
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:32,462
and try to drown one another,
which is always fun.

893
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,756
But the letter said--

894
01:25:34,966 --> 01:25:38,301
Everything was fake?
The letter was meant for me.

895
01:25:38,803 --> 01:25:40,470
Fuller was talking about my world.

896
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:44,558
So what are you saying?

897
01:25:45,142 --> 01:25:49,145
You're saying there's another world
on top of this one?

898
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,064
That's right.

899
01:25:54,569 --> 01:25:57,404
-I don't understand.
-Fuller found out about it.

900
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,822
They killed him.

901
01:26:00,491 --> 01:26:02,075
Why didn't they kill you?

902
01:26:02,702 --> 01:26:04,369
Maybe they will.

903
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:07,622
Maybe that's why
you're pointing a gun at me.

904
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:10,208
I'm sorry, Ashton.

905
01:26:10,918 --> 01:26:12,127
We're stuck here.

906
01:26:12,545 --> 01:26:14,170
You and me...

907
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,090
and the rest of us.

908
01:26:20,094 --> 01:26:22,095
I want to see it.

909
01:26:23,347 --> 01:26:25,140
-See what?
-My arcade game.

910
01:27:42,134 --> 01:27:43,176
It's breathing.

911
01:27:53,437 --> 01:27:55,939
So this is where I was born.

912
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:16,167
And this is where you die.

913
01:28:26,804 --> 01:28:27,887
What are you doing?

914
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:29,514
Watching you dream.

915
01:28:34,103 --> 01:28:36,187
How much longer do you have?

916
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:40,150
10 minutes.

917
01:28:50,661 --> 01:28:53,329
Hi, honey, I'm home.

918
01:28:53,914 --> 01:28:55,790
Did you miss me?

919
01:28:59,628 --> 01:29:00,670
David.

920
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:06,301
When did you download?

921
01:29:06,886 --> 01:29:08,553
Obviously, not soon enough.

922
01:29:09,138 --> 01:29:10,430
I was just doing my job.

923
01:29:11,307 --> 01:29:12,348
Sure you were.

924
01:29:14,351 --> 01:29:16,436
He's shutting down
the system, isn't he?

925
01:29:21,484 --> 01:29:24,569
Aside from his devilish good looks...

926
01:29:25,571 --> 01:29:28,114
what's so special about this guy?

927
01:29:30,993 --> 01:29:32,577
He reminds me of you.

928
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:35,622
-The way you used to be.
-I'm still the same.

929
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:37,290
No, you're not.

930
01:29:39,043 --> 01:29:41,461
Why did you butcher those people?

931
01:29:45,424 --> 01:29:46,716
Because it was fun.

932
01:29:48,427 --> 01:29:50,220
You've lost your mind.

933
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,978
You're the one who's fucking sick!

934
01:29:59,271 --> 01:30:02,148
Falling in love
with a fucking simulation.

935
01:30:02,483 --> 01:30:04,442
I was just having some fun.

936
01:30:04,652 --> 01:30:06,069
Just like you did.

937
01:30:06,529 --> 01:30:10,573
I think you're lying.
Just remember, he's a part of me.

938
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:11,825
That's not true.

939
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:16,037
It's okay.

940
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:20,750
Just pretend you're fucking him.

941
01:32:00,976 --> 01:32:02,018
Why?

942
01:32:03,229 --> 01:32:04,896
I guess I'm just jealous.

943
01:32:35,135 --> 01:32:36,177
You okay?

944
01:32:36,387 --> 01:32:38,513
What the hell took you so long?

945
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:58,449
How'd you know he'd try to kill you?

946
01:32:59,868 --> 01:33:02,495
I knew when he was
planning to download.

947
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:06,749
He's dead?

948
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:08,710
A bullet will do that to you.

949
01:33:22,808 --> 01:33:25,226
So, is somebody gonna
unplug me now?

950
01:33:30,316 --> 01:33:32,317
Do me a favor, will you?

951
01:33:32,818 --> 01:33:35,403
When you get back to
wherever you come from...

952
01:33:35,612 --> 01:33:38,197
just leave us alone
down here, okay?

953
01:34:49,728 --> 01:34:52,730
"June 21st, 2024."

954
01:35:37,943 --> 01:35:39,318
Where am I?

955
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:44,449
Come, I'll show you.

956
01:36:18,317 --> 01:36:21,235
Jane, we're getting hungry!

957
01:36:21,695 --> 01:36:24,572
Tell Virginia we're waiting for lunch.

958
01:36:31,246 --> 01:36:32,288
My father.

959
01:36:32,789 --> 01:36:34,332
Fuller was modeled after him.

960
01:36:43,842 --> 01:36:46,842
There's so many things
I have to tell you about, Doug.
