The National Association

Perfect.
How much should he give?

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,970
He's a generous man. I'd say, all he's got.

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,680
No, that's the CIA.

163
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,440
We protect our government's
communications,

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,270
try to break
the other fellow's codes.

165
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,770
We're the good guys, Marty.

166
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,320
Gee, I can't tell you
what a relief that is, Dick.

167
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,240
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

168
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,370
If you change your mind
call us at this number...

169
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,290
Mr. Brice.

170
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,660
Help me out?

171
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,750
Spare a quarter? Help me out. The
government's taken away my home.

172
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,630
Talk to him.

173
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,390
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

174
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,980
You know, I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

175
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,860
Hey, hey, we're all friends here, right?
Easy, easy.

176
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,700
Want some coffee or something?

177
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,030
No.

178
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,910
Buddy, is that Janek's file?

179
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,110
Yeah, Janek's file.

180
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,790
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

181
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,090
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

182
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,510
Specializes in large number
theory, prime numbers, factoring.

183
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,300
Cryptography. Very good.

184
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,630
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

185
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,680
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

186
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,130
It's our job to be curious,
so we traced the money.

187
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,810
Guess where it comes from?

188
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
I know you're not gonna say Russia.
Yeah.

189
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,180
Give me a break.

190
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,520
We won, they lost, you know?
It's been in a couple of papers.

191
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

192
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,650
We intercepted a fax
last week. Here.

193
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,900
They're making some kind of box,
a little black box.

194
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,030
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

195
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,080
Security technology...
Sensor techniques, who knows?

196
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,200
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

197
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,160
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

198
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
Yeah. No way.

199
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,800
Sorry, Marty. We don't
have a lot of choice here.

200
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,510
Do it yourself.

201
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,550
We can't. Why not?

202
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,180
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

203
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,510
Then get the FBI.

204
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,690
Yeah, right, the FBI.

205
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,360
The FBI can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

206
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,400
We don't have the time.
So, why me?

207
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,520
Frankly, because we...

208
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,100
Yeah, frankly.

209
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,780
Marty, sit down, please.

210
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,950
Frankly, because
it's kind of illegal.

211
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,080
You've managed to stay
underground more than 20 years.

212
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,580
You know how not to get caught.

213
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,380
We know you can
keep your mouth shut.

214
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,330
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

215
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,790
You can distribute it
among the poor, if you like.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,050
Pass.

217
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,500
We also clean up your record.

218
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,340
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

219
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,430
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years, and that was
without flight to evade prosecution.

220
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,730
We all know what happened
to him in there.

221
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,650
If I say no?

222
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,940
Don't say no.

223
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,230
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

224
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,080
I don't believe this. You
lied to us all these years.

225
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,250
Even lied to us about your name.

226
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Sorry, okay?

227
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm sorry, but when you're
wanted by the feds,

228
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,210
you don't go around
telling everybody.

229
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,590
We're not everybody, Martin. We're
your partners. You tell us.

230
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,010
Fine.

231
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,220
Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

232
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,840
We all have our little
secrets, don't we?

233
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,560
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

234
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,350
This is not a test. The penetration
is live. The target is unaware.

235
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,530
Sneaking a foreign intelligence
service that might kill us

236
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,730
to keep us out
is not what we do.

237
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,070
The probable level of security
is very low.

238
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,780
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

239
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,870
Fine. I understand. Don't do it.

240
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,420
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

241
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,120
I don't care if you go to jail.

242
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,960
Me neither. I'm in.

243
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,680
Could we maybe just go back to
the "they might kill us" part?

244
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,180
If I thought
that was likely to happen,

245
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,430
I wouldn't bring this to you.

246
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,630
But there is a risk.

247
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,190
It pays $175,000!

248
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm in.

249
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,950
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.
All right. What do we need?

250
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,660
Okay. We start with a very light
surveillance. Level three.

First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. in the afternoon.

253
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

254
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,460
Okay, let's do it.

255
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,920
For the lecture, you wanna take
Whistler or do you want me?

256
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,470
No, that's okay.
I thought I'd ask Liz.

259
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,310
Sort of an old friend.

Hi.

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,480
We're not getting back together.

264
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,360
Did I say anything? You will.

265
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm here on business, Liz.

266
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,830
Bishop,
you don't have a business.

267
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,250
You have a club.
It's a boys' club.

268
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,540
You have a little clubhouse. You
probably have a secret handshake.

269
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,240
Liz, I need your help.

270
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,250
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

I have a new group
of gifted children now,

and I like the fact
that they're under 30.

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,590
Excuse me.

274
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,470
There's a mathematician named Gunter Janek.
You know him?

275
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,470
I've read him. Now go away.

He's giving a master lecture

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,100
How nice for him.

278
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,600
I thought I'd buy you
dinner after.

279
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,100
I am not going out with you.

280
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,440
This isn't a date, dummy. This is a
scientific exploration, a tutorial.

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
I need you...

282
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,030
To explain it to me.

283
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,820
Read a book.

284
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,490
They found me, Liz.

285
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
The government found me.

286
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,630
They offered me a deal. If I take
their offer, they clear my record,

287
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,880
and I can get my name back.

288

You and I
are not getting back together.

Hey, don't flatter yourself.

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,730
Pick me up at 3:00.

291
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,280
Yes!

292
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,290
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known,

293
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,660
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

294
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,000
This guy's good.

295
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Shh!

296
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,220
...over the rationals and, hence,
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

297
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,590
Using the Artin map, we might
induce homomorphisms...

298

You seeing anybody? Shh!

299
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,900
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the...

This isn't just about large number theory.
It's about cryptography.

301
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,690
Oh? You mean codes?

302
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,950
I mean unbreakable codes.

303
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,660
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions,

304
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:20,340
and allow us to acquire the solution in
a dramatically more efficient manner.

305
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,290
Are you seeing... Shh!

306
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,210
Such an approach
is purely theoretical.

307
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,840
So far, no one has been able
to accomplish

308
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,170
such constructions yet.

could not break them down.

311
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,690
But maybe,
just maybe there's a shortcut.

may be our best tools.

how wonderful to see you.

Hi, Greg. How are you?
Is it not fabulous?

319
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,760
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

320
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,260
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

Oh! Goodness, can it be?

Oh, yeah. Elizabeth.

She's dying
to talk to you too, Greg.

325

Excuse me. Elizabeth.

My heart leaps like gazelle to
see you back together again.

Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

are such good friends,

to do occasional favor for me?

Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

I'll bet.

about the "New World Order."

Ajar of pencils,

It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

He's logging on the computer.

00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,970
Here, maybe this might help.

475
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,050
Old buddy of mine, was in
Desert Storm, sent it to me.

476
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,390
'Course, he was
on the other side.

to be a way around these things.</i>

478
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,020
All right, all right.

479
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,700
This might work.

480
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,240
Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,540
Yeah. Right.

482
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,420
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.

483
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,500
Yeah.

484
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,880
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

485
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,300
That worked.

486
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,660
Got it.

487
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,120
Gunter? You're...

488
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,500
Oh, God, no.
Here you go, come on.

489
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,080
Hey, nice to see you.

490

Monitor the audio.
Grab the mike.

494
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,630
Okay-

495
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,970
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, do not scream.

496
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,850
I promise nothing is
going to happen to you.

497
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,020
Okay?

498
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,400
Mmm-hmm.

499
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Who are you?

500
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,120
He's a P.l.

501
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,370
You're a private investigator.

502
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,570
I'm a private investigator.

503
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,580
But why? Who hired you?

504
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,410
Huh?

505
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,000
Who hired you?

506
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,460
Mrs. Janek.

507
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,470
There is not Mrs. Janek.

508
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,310
Yeah?

509
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,140
You got us stumped.

510
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,520
Oh yeah? Who do you think paid for
your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

511
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,230
That was good.

512
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,780
Velma, Velma Janek.

513
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,110
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings,

514
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,620
vast real estate holdings.

515
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,000
Farms, banks, shopping malls.
Two shopping malls.

516
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,870
She supports Gunter but figured
he was cheating on her,

517
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,080
and that's why she hired me.

518
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,010
Bastard liar!

519
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,380
I'll kill him! Oh, no, no, no!

520
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,130
No! No, no, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

521
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,010
Get a hold of yourself.

522
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,380
You gotta not tell him you know.
Ha!

523
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,270
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

524
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,440
You don't know anything
about a wife.

525
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,110
You just give me
one good reason why.

526
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,610
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

527
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,700
Give you a really good reason.

528
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,870
It's just what she would
want you to do.

529
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,040
It's just what she
wants you to do.

530
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,870
I don't understand.

531
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,970
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

532
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,970
Here, look, I might lose
my license for this.

533
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,310
My client is a vindictive,
bitter woman.

534
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,480
She's been withholding marital
favors from Gunter for years,

535
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,140
and now she's out to ruin him.

536
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,560
(STAMMERING) And she's
using you to get to her.

537
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,860
And she's using
me to get to you.

538
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,780
I know that's confusing, but don't
you see what's happening here?

539
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,150
You and me, we're just pawns
in this ugly little game.

540
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,330
Pawns.

541
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,410
If you love him...

542
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,250
If you really love him...

543
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,760
Then just keep on loving him.

544
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,670
And never let him know

545
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,430
that you know what he thinks
you don't know you know.

546
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,630
You know?

547
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,770
And give him head
whenever he wants.

548
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,390
Give him help.

549
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,610
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.
Can you do that for Gunter?

550
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,980
Yes, yes, I can, I can.

551
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,490
Okay, good.

552
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
Now get out of here.

553
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,620
Give him head?

554
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,960
Be a beacon?

555
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,720
(CHAIN OF FOOLS

<i>(SINGING) Chain, chain, chain

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,160
<i>I'm just a link
in your chain, oh.</i>

563
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,080
But the key meeting
took place July 1, 1958,

564
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,580
when the Air Force brought this
space visitor to the White House

565
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,880
for an interview with President Eisenhower.
And Ike said,

566
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,580
"Look, give us your technology."

567
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,170
"We'll give you all
the cow lips you want."

568
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,130
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

569
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,140
Your husband knows about cattle
mutilations. He's ex-CIA.

570
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,260
He's touched.

571
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,510
He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

572
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,940
Understood, understood.

573
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,980
One thing I don't quite get
though is you and Cosmo,

574
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,610
you were taking all these
chances, all these big chances,

575
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,570
what for?

576
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,320
We were young.
And there was a war on.

577
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,450
It was a good way to meet girls.

578
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,700
I bet.

579
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,040
How come you didn't get caught?

580
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,250
I went out for pizza.

581
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,000
Then I went to Canada.

582
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,220
I was lucky. He wasn't.

583
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,930
Did he ever forgive you?

584
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,850
I hope so.

585
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,890
He died in prison.

586
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,080
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

587
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,650
Don?

588
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,620
Well, we have never been
to Europe together.

589
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
That's right.

590
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,830
And we are going.

591
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,750
Madrid, Lisbon.

592
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,830
Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

593
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,130
And Tahiti.

594
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,880
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

595
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,420
Mother?

596
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,050
Well, you know, I've never
actually had a really cool car

597
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,640
that I could
fit comfortably into.

598
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,640
So I think
I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago

599
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,270
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

600

Carl?

601
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,400
I'd like to have a deep
relationship with a beautiful woman

602
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,280
who melts from the very
first time our eyes meet.

603
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,290
We're not
getting paid that much, Carl.

604
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,250
Well, you know,
someone like Liz.

605
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,660
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

606
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,830
ALL: Ooh! Uh-oh.

607
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,420
Whistler?

609
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,350
Peace on earth,

MOTHER: Hear, hear!

613
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,770
That's not a word, "scrunchy".

614
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,230
Scrunchy is not a word.

615
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,980
Scrunchy is a word.

616
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,150
Since when? You know what
happens to your face?

617
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,870
Please, it's not a word. Right
now your face is scrunchy.

618
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,940
CREASE: All right.
We gotta take it as a word.

619
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,420
LIZ:
It's better than "scrunchy."

620
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,670
BISHOP:
I didn't invent the word.

621
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,670
Carl. Yes.

622
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,420
What does it say where this is?

623
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,680
Hold on a second here.

624
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,050
"System out."

625
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,100
Guys, I really think you
should leave that thing alone.

626
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,690
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

627
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,780
How are they spelling Setec?

628
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,950
S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

629
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,240
Special extraterrestrial?

630
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,420
Earthling counter.

631
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,910
Does that make two, four, five.

632
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,540
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around

633
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,100
and looks at me,
like right dead in my eyes.

634
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,390
Setec.

635
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,810
What?

636
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Setec Astronomy.

637
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,850
I just love it
when a man says that to me.

638
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,270
Setec doesn't mean anything.

639
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,070
Excuse me...

640
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:26,560
Carl, can you get me some cable
and that IO interface, please?

641
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,200
"Monterey's Coast."

642
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,450
Does "Monterey's Coast"
mean anything to you guys?

643
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,620
No.

644
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,550
Here, help me with this.

645
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,130
Carl, get the diagnostics.

646
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,650
How about "My Socrates Note"?

647
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,560
No.

648
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,860
Uh-uh.

649
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,160
No, I...

650
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,500
No. No.

651
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,180
Uh-huh. Got it.
Move to another one.

652
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,030
Mmm-hmm. Give me another one.

653
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,990
Stay in that quadrant.

654
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,300
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

655
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,870
Whoa.

656
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,460
Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

657
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,920
MOTHER: All right.

658
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,550
Holy cow.

659
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,810
What the hell is this?

660
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,330
"Too Many Secrets."

661
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:56,630
Bish, I think you
better come over here.

662
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
Carl, got your
little black book?

663
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,250
Yes.

664
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,090
Give me the number for something
impossible to access.

665
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,840
Okay. What about this?

666
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,350
Federal Reserve transfer node,
Culpeper, Virginia.

667
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

668
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,690
CARL: Nine hundred billion
a day goes through there.

669
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,810
That'll do. Punch it in.

670
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,770
Okay-

671
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,990
We won't get in. It's encrypted.

672
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,790
CARL: See?

673
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,580
Mother, that last contact.

674
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,960
WHISTLER: Look at this, boys.

675
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,470
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

676
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,180
Hey, don't screw around
with that thing!

677
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,310
Wait, Crease.

678
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,350
Carl, what else you got?

679
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,810
National power grid?

680
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,140
(CHUCKLES)

681
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,820
Okay-

682
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,450
Here we come.

683
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,580
Okay, Mother.

684
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,900
Probing.

685
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,540
Wow. Unbelievable.

686
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,540
WHISTLER: Anybody want to
black out New England?

687
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Carl, what else?

688
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,710
Air traffic control system.

689
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,260
(TYPING)

690
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,140
Okay, Mother.

691
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,190
Oh, my God.

692
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,450
CREASE: How is this possible?

693
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,950
Cryptography systems are based on
mathematical problems so complex

694
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,450
they cannot be solved
without a key.

695
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,160
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key,

696
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,790
and he hard-wired it
into that chip.

697
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,120
Turn it off.

698
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,130
Want to crash a couple
of passenger jets?

699
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,000
I said turn it off.

700
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,880
BISHOP: Turn it Off.

701
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,430
So it's a code-breaker.

702
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,900
No, it's the code-breaker.

703
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,070
No more secrets.

704
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,570
Honey, you and Melissa
get your things.

705
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,380
Night-night.

706
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,580
Good night.

707
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,710
What time is the hand-off?

708
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,390
9:00 a.m.

709
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,090
Well, between now and then,

710
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,640
we are going to institute
some security around here.

711
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,610
This is where I get off. Nice to
see you again. I'm out of here.

712
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:12,320
Don't take this personally, Liz, but you
were the only one who knew Martin's secret.

713
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,990
Somebody talked.

714
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,530
So make yourself comfortable. We're
all staying right here tonight.

715
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,210
No. I'm getting my bag,
and I'm leaving.

716
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,550
So relax, Crease.

717
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,050
I'll relax when we get
that damn thing out of here.

718
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,970
Until then, you stay.

719
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,510
What?

720
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,480
There isn't a government
on this planet

721
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,310
that wouldn't kill us all
for that thing.

722
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,700
Sorry.

723
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,830
I see.

724
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,330
Carl? Hit the alarm.

725
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,750
Mother, lock everything down.

726
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,750
Then kill the lights.
Whistler, unplug that thing.

727
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,880
You bet.

728
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,130
Thank you for the trust,
fellows.

729
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,140
(LOADING GUN)

730
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,960
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

731
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,220
Bye, Liz WHISTLER: You too, Liz.

732
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,900
I hope the hand-off goes well.

733
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,730
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

734
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,530
Martin? Time.

735
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,790
Yeah.

736
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,000
Morning. Hi.

737
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,580
Any problems?

738
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,010
Nope.

739
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,750
Want a cappuccino?

740
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,960
No.

741
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,320
Got his check?

742
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,490
CREASE: Hey, Martin!

743
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,920
Telephone!

744
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,590
Just a minute.

745
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,340
It's your mother.

746
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,520
She's... She's old. Excuse me.

747
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,580
Get in the car.

748
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,120
What?

749
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,120
Get in the car.

750
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,050
MARTIN: I didn't get the money.

751
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,250
Now!

752
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,010
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

753
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,760
Janek's dead.

754
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,300
They killed him.

755
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,760
The NSA doesn't kill people,
Martin. Who are they?

756
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,640
You said there isn't a
government on earth

757
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,070
that wouldn't kill
for that thing.

758
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,810
Not ours. Who were those guys?

759
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,480
There's one way to find out.

760
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:27,930
They took away my home. Help me out?
The government took away my home.

761
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,430
My God.

762
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,650
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

763
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,400
And don't tell me you won't do
it, because I've got to have it.

764
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,230
Damn it! I need to know,
and I need to know now.

765
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,040
Hey, guys,
that federal building?

766
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,450
Scheduled for demolition
since August.

767
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,250
It housed the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Agriculture.

768
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,450
Been vacant for a month.

769
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,580
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

770
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,460
Their West Coast operations
are right out of Los Angeles.

771
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,170
Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

772
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,840
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

773
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,590
WHISTLER: Oh no.

774
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,760
How could you
be so goddamn stupid?

775
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,060
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

776
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,690
They probably were government...

777
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,530
Just not ours.

778
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:29,150
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

779
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,660
CREASE: What do you
think you're doing?

780
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,910
I'm going to a concert.

781
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,730
Keep smiling.

782
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,190
Martin, have you lost your mind?

783
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,940
Excuse yourself.

784
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,070
Darling, would you
excuse me for a moment?

785
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,970
Give me back Janek's box, Greg.

786
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,050
Martin, I don't have it.

787
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,550
Now you must believe me.

788
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,970
No.

789
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,940
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

790
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,640
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

791
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,850
Not for lack of trying,
mind you.

792
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,810
Your codes are entirely
different from ours.

793
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,650
We never had any luck
in breaking them,

794
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,070
so Lord knows,
I wanted that box,

795
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,410
but we did not take it.

796
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,500
Then who did?

797
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,330
What I will tell you now I cannot
tell you in this building.

798
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,170
Do you understand?

799
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,760

877

The whole network is protected by
a very powerful encryption system

cannot read it.

The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

897
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,370
Because money's most powerful
ability is to allow bad people

to continue doing bad things at the

operates not on reality...

to withdraw their money.

All right. It's time we
call the authorities.

970
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:29,330
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

971
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,370
All the more reason to turn ourselves
in now while we can still cut a deal.

972
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:37,540
With what? We got bupkus! They'll give
us 20 years in the electric chair.

We have no other choice.

Yes, we do. We make the call,

Well, l... Highway.

01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,780
PlayTronics'
corporate headquarters.

1119
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,570
The complete blueprints.

1120
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,870
Not bad. Not bad, Carl.

1121
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,440
Oh, thanks.

1122
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:31,990
Where'd you get the 50 bucks?

1123
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,070
I took it from Mother's wallet.

1124
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,450
Good.

1125
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,670
No, Mom, today's not a good
day to come over. No...

1126
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,420
Okay, what have we got here?

1127
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,340
It's called a mantrap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

1128
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:50,390
It's a digital voice-recognition
monitor hooked up to an access booth.

1129
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,180
NSA uses the same technology

1130
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,760
to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade.

1131
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,100
Card?

1132
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,520
Now speak right into this box.

1133
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,570
Hi.

1134
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,110
My name is Martin Bishop.

1135
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:11,240
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.

1136
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,040
WHISTLER:
And you can't pass through

1137
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,870
unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

1138
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:21,290
So we need someone's card.
And their voice.

1139
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:22,790
Can we beat this with tape?

1140
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:24,750
Has to be up close and personal.

1141
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:27,800
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth

1142
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,300
while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

1143
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,590
Ah, that's great.

1144
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,420
Really great.
What about motion detectors?

1145
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:37,730
I'm picking one up this afternoon.
That makes beating this look easy.

1146
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,060
MOTHER: Hey, Bish,
I think we've found our guy.

1147
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,360
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

1148
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,990
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

1149
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,570
Let me zoom in
on the front door.

1150
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,780
A lady in a green skirt
and this guy with the cap.

1151
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:03,500
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.
So it's one of those two.

1152
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:07,170
Right. Here's the next evening.
Again...

1153
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,470
The office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

1154
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:15,760
The guy in the cap.

1155
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,060
Anybody else?

1156
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:21,140
Nobody else comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

1157
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:25,150
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

1158
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,770
Let me see.

1160
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,070
Another bump. Enhancing.

1161
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,410
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

1162
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:47,250
Cute. All right. Carl,
let's do this guy.

1163
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,210
His name's Werner Brandes.

no outstanding

1166
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,630
CARL: He leaves work between
6:00 and 7:00 every night,

1167
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,220
takes the same route home,
he obeys the speed limit,

1168
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,520
comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

1169
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,890
He's a very safe driver.

no long distance. Club Med brochure.

1181

A ticket stub

I love it. Let's get him a date.

on the cereal company sneak last year?

Forget it. Married a cop.

How about Barbara?
Now, she was cute.

1189
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,560
Yeah, but she'd never do it. She
regards this work as juvenfle.

1190
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,060
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

Yeah, she's buff. Fellows...

1192

He's not looking for buff.

Oh, yeah.

1215
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:40,190
We can wrap you in a full body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber,

1216
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,270
or we can raise the temperature

which is probably
what we'll have to do

1219
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,070
because the neoprene
would suffocate you.

1220
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:52,750
Either way, you've got a top
speed of two inches per second.

Any faster than that...

I'm Bernard Abbott,

1559
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,840
We spoke on the phone.

1560
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,090
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1561
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:30,770
It's interesting, don't you think,
you guys, that the NSA is here?

1562
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:33,720
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1563
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:37,610
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

1564
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:42,360
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody to
know about Janek's little black box.

1565
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,440
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1566
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:49,450
He said our codes were based on an entirely
different system than the Russian codes,

1567
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:53,880
so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1568
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,380
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1569
01:56:57,460 --> 01:57:00,580
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the FBl's mail.

1570
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:04,420
Or the CIA's.
Or the White House's.

1571
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:08,300
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1572
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:12,560
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

1573
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:16,600
Clear up my record.
Get out of my life.

1574
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,230
I don't have much choice, do I?

1575
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:23,070
Not unless you wanna
read about it in Newsweek.

1576
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,740
Deal. The box.

1577
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:27,490
MOTHER: Not so fast.

1578
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:31,830
I want a Winnebago.

1579
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:32,950
What?

1580
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:37,580
Fully equipped, big kitchen,
water bed, microwave.

1581
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,760
This is not
a car dealership, pal.

1582
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:41,750
He wants a Winnebago.

1583
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:49,060
All right, a Winnebago.

1584
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:51,510
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1585
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,690
Now the box.

1586
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:55,810
(CREASE CLEARING THROAT)

1587
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:59,980
I have never taken my wife
to Europe.

1588
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:03,560
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1589
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:06,820
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets

1590
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:12,000
to Athens, Lisbon,
Madrid and Scotland.

1591
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:14,200
Don't forget Tahiti.

1592
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:16,240
And Tahiti.

1593
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:17,790
Tahiti is not in Europe.

1594
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:19,250
Excuse me.

1595
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:21,920
When you get the box, then you
give us geography lessons.

1596
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,720
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1597
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,970
Fine! Tahiti!

1598
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,180
Carl?

1599
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:37,140
The young lady
with the Uzi, is she single?

1600
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:39,850
Carl. Excuse us.

1601
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:46,610
This is the brass ring. You
gotta think bigger thoughts.

1602
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:49,780
I just want her
telephone number.

1603
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:53,750
Please?

1604
01:58:55,950 --> 01:58:58,450
How about a lunch? You
can chaperon. No.

1605
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,250
I will not do this.

1606
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:03,170
Hey, Abby, come on.

1607
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:06,000
The FBl'd give him twins. No!

1608
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,300
Wait a second.

1609
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,440
You can have anything you want, and
you're asking for my phone number?

1610
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:16,600
Yes.

1611
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:23,310
273-9164. Area code 415.

1612
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,780
I'm Carl. I'm Mary.

1613
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:29,860
I'm going to be sick.

1614
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:33,450
ABBOTT: Are we done here?
Not yet. Whistler.

1615
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:39,170
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1616
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,960
This is ridiculous.

1617
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,550
He's serious.

1618
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:45,090
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1619
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:49,260
We are the United States government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1620
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,380
You're just gonna have to try.

1621
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:55,510
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

1622
01:59:55,970 --> 02:00:00,310
Thank you very much.
That's all I ask.

1623
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:05,060
How about you? What do you want?

1624
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,900
Oh, I'm fine.

1625
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:13,330
May I have the box?

1626
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:27,010
You know it doesn't work.
It never did.

1627
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,300
That's not important, is it?

1628
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:33,350
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

1629
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:36,350
This box doesn't exist.

1630
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:39,810
I never saw it before.

1631
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:41,480
Remember that.

1632
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,030
Bishop?

1633
02:00:54,110 --> 02:00:56,950
All you did
was say it was broken.

1634
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:02,540
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1635
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,630
Nope.

1636
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,920
<i>In a surprise announcement,</i>

1637

1638
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:16,640

1639
