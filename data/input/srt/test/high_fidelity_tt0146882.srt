1
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,891
Oh, yeah

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,560
Oh

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,401
You gotta wake up one mornin'
As the sun greets the dawn

4
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,782
You're gonna wake up one mornin'
As the sun greets the dawn

5
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:46,796
You didn't realize

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,007
You didn't realize

7
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,302
Oh, you're my best friend, baby

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,764
You're gonna miss me, baby

9
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,767
What came first?

10
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,895
The music or the misery?

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,148
People worry about
kids playing with guns,

12
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,566
or watching violent videos,

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,610
that some sort of culture of violence
will take them over.

14
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,156
Nobody worries about kids listening
to thousands, literally thousands

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,826
of songs about heartbreak, rejection,

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,121
pain, misery and loss.

17
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,708
Did I listen to pop music
because I was miserable?

18
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,003
Or was I miserable because
I listened to pop music?

19
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,602
You don't have to go this second.

20
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,230
- You can stay until whenever.
- No.

21
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,815
We've done the hard part now,
I might as well just...

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,859
Stay for tonight, then.

23
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,281
Laura.

24
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,369
You're just gonna...

25
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,389
My desert island, all-time top five

26
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,477
most memorable breakups,
in chronological order

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,521
are as follows,

28
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,608
Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick,

29
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,195
Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson
and Sarah Kendrew.

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,448
Those were the ones that really hurt.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,868
Can you see your name
on that list, Laura?

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,997
Maybe you'd sneak into the top 10.

33
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,501
But there's just no room for you
in the top five. Sorry!

34
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,212
Those places are reserved for
the kind of humiliation and heartbreak

35
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,548
you're just not capable of delivering.

36
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,679
If you really wanted to mess me up,

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,348
you should have gotten to me earlier!

38
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,576
Which brings us to number one
on the top five all-time breakup list,

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,995
Alison Ashmore.

40
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,207
One moment they weren't there,

41
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,626
not in any form
that interested us, anyway,

42
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,380
and then the next,
you couldn't miss them.

43
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,883
They were everywhere.

44
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,219
And they'd grown breasts.

45
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,345
And we wanted...

46
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,850
Actually, we didn't even know
what we wanted.

47
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,852
But it was something interesting.

48
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,272
Disturbing, even.

49
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:56,485
My relationship with Alison Ashmore
lasted for six hours,

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,364
the two hours after school,
before The Rockford Files,

51
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,117
for three days in a row.

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,828
But on the fourth afternoon...

53
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,458
Kevin Bannister.

54
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,378
Slut.

55
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,050
It would be nice to think that
since I was 14, times have changed.

56
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,969
Relationships have become
more sophisticated.

57
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,555
Females less cruel.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,642
Skins thicker.
Instincts more developed.

59
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,646
But there seems to be
an element of that afternoon

60
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,106
in everything
that's happened to me since.

61
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:39,320
All my romantic stories are
a scrambled version of that first one.

62
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,032
Number two on the top five
all-time breakup list

63
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,451
was Penny Hardwick.

64
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,829
Penny was great looking,
and her top five recording artists

65
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,792
were Carly Simon, Carole King,
James Taylor, Cat Stevens

66
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,794
and Elton John.

67
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,673
I remember when rock was young

68
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,884
Erin! No, come here!

69
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,388
Holdin' hands
and skimmin' stones

70
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,224
She was nice.

71
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,102
Nice manners, nice grades,
nice looking.

72
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,896
She was so nice, in fact,
that she wouldn't let me put my hand

73
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,566
underneath or even on top of her bra.

74
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,820
Attack and defense.
Invasion and repulsion.

75
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,822
It was as if breasts were
little pieces of property,

76
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,783
that had been unlawfully annexed
by the opposite sex.

77
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,577
They were rightfully ours,
and we wanted them back.

78
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,164
Sometimes I got so bored
of trying to touch her breast

79
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,375
that I would try to touch her
between her legs.

80
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,293
It was like trying to borrow a dollar,
getting turned down,

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,504
and asking for 50 grand instead.

82
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,010
I wasn't interested in
Penny's nice qualities, just breasts.

83
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,804
And therefore, she was no good to me.

84
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,016
What's the point?
It never goes anywhere.

85
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,272
Rob?

86
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,608
I started dating a girl
who everyone said

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,694
would give it up and who didn't,

88
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,821
and Penny went with this asshole
named Chris Thompson,

89
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,908
who told me he had sex with her
after something like three dates.

90
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,041
I own this store
called Championship Vinyl.

91
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,709
It's located in a neighborhood

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,046
that attracts the bare minimum
of window shoppers.

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,550
I get by because of the people
who make a special effort to shop here.

94
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,719
Mostly young men

95
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,346
who spend all their time
looking for deleted Smiths singles

96
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,517
and original, not re-released,
underlined, Frank Zappa albums.

97
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,616
Fetish properties are not unlike porn.

98
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,495
I'd feel guilty taking their money,
if I wasn't,

99
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,789
well, kind of one of them.

100
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,630
- Morning, Dick.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.

101
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,757
Have a good weekend?

102
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,009
Yeah, okay.

103
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,554
I found the first Licorice Comfits
album over at Vintage Vinyl.

104
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,431
The one on Testament of Youth.

105
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,267
Never released here,
a Japanese import only.

106
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,686
Great. Great.

107
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:22,274
- I'll tape it for you.
- No, that's okay. Really.

108
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,361
You liked their second one, you said.
Pop, Girls, etc.

109
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,947
That's the one
with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.

110
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,663
Oh, you never saw the cover, though.
You just had that tape I made you.

111
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,665
Yeah, I haven't really
absorbed that one yet.

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,586
Well...

113
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,964
- I'll just make it for you.
- Okay.

114
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,808
Dick, what's this?

115
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,936
It's the new Belle and Sebastian.
You like it?

116
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,490
Holy Shiite. What the fuck is that?

117
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,993
It's the new Belle and Sebastian...

118
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,662
It's a record we've been listening to
and enjoying, Barry.

119
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,958
Well, that's unfortunate,
because it sucks ass.

120
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,586
Yours, I assume?

121
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,682
Mmm, yeah

122
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,894
I used to think
maybe you loved me

123
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,938
Now, baby, I'm sure

124
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,815
Turn it off, Barry!

125
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,735
And I just can't wait till the day

126
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,112
- It won't go any louder.
- Turn it off!

127
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,203
Now every time
I go for the mailbox

128
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,747
I hold myself down

129
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,920
'Cause I just can't wait
till you write me or

130
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,091
Okay, buddy. Uh...

131
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,928
I was just trying to cheer us up.
So, go ahead.

132
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,555
Put on some old sad bastard music.
See if I care.

133
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,933
I don't want to hear
old sad bastard music, Barry.

134
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,810
- I just want something I can ignore.
- Here's the thing.

135
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,063
I made that tape special for today,

136
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,815
my special Monday morning tape
for you, special.

137
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,068
It's fucking Monday afternoon!
You should get out of bed earlier.

138
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,570
Come on, dude.

139
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,531
Play it. Don't you want
to hear what's next?

140
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,076
- What's next?
- Play it!

141
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,245
Say it.

142
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,330
Little Latin Lupe Lu.

143
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,707
Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels?

144
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,585
No!

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,213
- The Righteous Brothers.
- Well, never mind.

146
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,464
No, not "never mind." Tell me right now.

147
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,840
What's wrong with
The Righteous Brothers?

148
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,051
Nothing, I just prefer the other...

149
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,177
Bullshit!

150
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,055
How can it be bullshit
to state a preference?

151
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,848
Since when did this store
become a fascist regime?

152
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,642
Since you brought that tape in.

153
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,977
Oh, man, that's great!

154
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,937
That's the fun thing
about workin' in a record store.

155
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,481
You get to play crappy pap
you don't even want to listen to.

156
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,441
I thought this tape was gonna be

157
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,195
a fuckin' conversation stimulator, man!

158
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,657
I was gonna ask you for your top five
records to play on a Monday morning.

159
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,785
- You just had to fuckin' ruin it.
- We'll do it next Monday.

160
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,037
No! I wanna do it now!

161
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,289
I can't fire them.

162
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,915
I hired these guys
for three days a week

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,169
and they just started showing up
every day, that was four years ago.

164
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,719
Number three in the top five
all-time breakup list?

165
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,222
Charlie Nicholson.
Sophomore year at college.

166
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,058
Whoo! Am I glad that's over.

167
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,102
As soon as I saw her,
I realized she was the kind of girl

168
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,647
I'd wanted to meet ever since
I was old enough to meet girls.

169
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,733
I mean, she was different.

170
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,736
She was dramatic,
and she was exotic.

171
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,614
And she talked a lot,
and when she talked,

172
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,578
she said remarkably interesting things
about music, books, film and politics.

173
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
And she talked a lot.

174
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,457
Have you ever seen him
less than 300 feet tall?

175
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,584
- No.
- Huh? No.

176
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,338
And you won't, will you,
sweetheart? No.

177
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,008
Kiss my neck. Yeah.

178
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:21,764
And she liked me.
She liked me. She liked me.

179
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,142
At least, I think she did.

180
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,561
- Do you like that one?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,855
It's okay.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,274
We went out for two years.

183
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,694
And I never got comfortable.

184
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,032
Why would a girl, no,
a woman like Charlie go out with me?

185
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,539
I felt like a fraud.

186
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,541
I felt like one of those people
who suddenly shave their heads

187
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,377
and said they'd always been punks.

188
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,088
I was sure I'd be discovered
at any second.

189
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,677
And I worried about
my abilities as a lover.

190
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,898
And I was intimidated by other men
in her design department

191
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,985
and became convinced she was
gonna leave me for one of them.

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,993
Then she left me for one of them.

193
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,912
The dreaded Marco.

194
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:32,126
Charlie! You fucking bitch!
Let's work it out!

195
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,879
Just open the fucking door. Charlie!

196
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,341
Look, let's talk it...

197
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,944
And then I lost it.

198
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,990
Kinda lost it all, you know?

199
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,451
Faith, dignity, about 15 pounds.

200
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,253
When I came to, a few months later,

201
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,756
I found, to my surprise,
I had flunked out of school.

202
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,136
Started working at a record shop.

203
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,138
Some people never got over 'Nam,

204
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,849
or the night their band
opened for Nirvana.

205
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,643
I guess I never really got over Charlie.

206
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,980
But the thing I learned
from the whole Charlie debacle

207
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,982
is that you gotta punch your weight.

208
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,818
You see, Charlie, she's out of my class.

209
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,906
She's too pretty.
Too smart. Too witty. Too much.

210
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,533
I mean, what am I? I'm a middleweight.

211
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,827
Hey, I'm not
the smartest guy in the world,

212
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,829
but I'm certainly not the dumbest.

213
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,457
I mean, I've read books like
Unbearable Lightness of Being,

214
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,793
and Love in the Time of Cholera.

215
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,881
And I think I've understood them.
They're about girls, right?

216
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,049
Just kidding.

217
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,843
But I have to say,

218
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,012
my all-time favorite book
is Johnny Cash's autobiography,

219
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
Cash by Johnny Cash.

220
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,684
- Championship.
- Hi.

221
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,778
Hi.

222
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,447
Um...

223
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,659
I was thinking
I could come by the house

224
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,578
and pick up some stuff
while you're at work tomorrow.

225
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,373
While I'm at work. While I'm at work.

226
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,832
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

227
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,294
That's what you've got to say,
is "Oh, boy," and "Bravo."

228
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,882
- Laura, this is just so dumb.
- Look, Rob, I gotta go.

229
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,805
I'm looking for a record
for my daughter for her birthday.

230
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,892
I Just Called to Say I Love You.
Do you have it?

231
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,895
- Yeah. We have it.
- Great. Great.

232
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,773
- Can I have it, then?
- No. No.

233
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,817
- You can't.
- Why not?

234
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,069
It's sentimental, tacky crap.

235
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,072
Do we look like the kind of store that
sells I Just Called to Say I Love You?

236
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,908
- Go to the mall.
- What's your problem?

237
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,245
Do you even know your daughter?
There's no way she likes that song.

238
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,664
- Oh, is she in a coma?
- Oh, okay, buddy.

239
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,293
I didn't know it was "Pick On
the Middle-Aged Square Guy" Day.

240
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,295
My apologies. I'll be on my way.

241
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,879
Bye-bye.

242
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,884
Fuck you.

243
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,974
Nice, Barry. Really, really nice.
It was top class.

244
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,184
Rob, "Top Five Musical Crimes

245
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,770
"Perpetrated by Stevie Wonder
in the '80s and '90s." Go.

246
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,190
Sub-question, is it, in fact, unfair

247
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,693
to criticize a formerly great artist
for latter-day sins?

248
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,195
Is it better to burn out
than to fade away?

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,948
- Barry, I'm fucking broke, man.
- He was gonna buy one record

250
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,492
which we didn't have,
and then leave and never come back.

251
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,119
That's not the point.
What did he ever do to you?

252
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,537
He offended me with his terrible taste.

253
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,706
It wasn't his terrible taste.
It was his daughter's.

254
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,959
Are you defending that ass-muncher?
Come on, Rob.

255
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,420
You're goin' soft in your old age. Jesus.

256
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,964
Now, all of a sudden
I'm offending your golf buddy.

257
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,008
I'm gonna tell you something
for your own good, pal.

258
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,762
That's the worst fuckin' sweater
I've ever seen. It's a Cosby sweater.

259
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,680
A Cosby sweater!

260
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,141
Did Laura let you leave
the house like that?

261
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:20,479
- Fuckin' asshole.
- Hey, hey!

262
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,481
- Will you shut up? Will you?
- Break it up.

263
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,900
You're a fuckin' maniac. I swear to God.
If you tore this thing,

264
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,694
it's vintage,
and I will fucking sock your nose.

265
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,738
You'll pay big.

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,001
Are you all right?

267
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,506
Yeah. Look, Dick. Laura and I broke up.

268
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,885
She's gone. So if we ever see
Barry again, you can tell him that.

269
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,722
Oh, of course I will, Rob. No problem.

270
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,475
No problem at all.

271
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,021
I'll tell him next time I see him.

272
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,649
Definitely.

273
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,654
I've got some other stuff
to tell him anyway, so it's no problem.

274
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:15,367
I'll just tell him, you know, about Laura,

275
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,996
then, when I tell him the other stuff.

276
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,791
Mmm.

277
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,920
Do you want to talk about it?

278
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,464
That kind of thing?

279
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,260
No. Thank you, though, Dick.

280
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,137
Thank you.

281
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,868
Look at these.

282
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,411
I used to dream I'd be surrounded

283
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,872
by exotic women's underwear
forever and ever.

284
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,874
Now I know they just save
their best pairs

285
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,294
for the nights they know
they're gonna sleep with somebody.

286
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,181
Hello, Laura, this is your mother.

287
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,183
Your father's angina
is a little rough today.

288
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,769
I thought he might like
to talk to you. It's no big deal.

289
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,812
I love you two. Bye-bye.

290
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,191
Anyway, me and Charlie,
we didn't match.

291
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,568
Marco and Charlie matched.

292
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,489
But me and Sarah, number four
on the all-time list, we matched.

293
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,450
She'd just been dumped
by some asshole named Michael.

294
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,453
I mean, Michael was such an asshole.

295
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,789
I'd just been run over by Charlie.

296
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,874
I know exactly what you mean.

297
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,294
I mean, it's just so painful.

298
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,839
And draining. I'm just gonna be
by myself for awhile.

299
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,718
Me, too. Me, too.

300
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,519
It made sense to pool our
collective loathing for the opposite sex,

301
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,145
and while we were at it,

302
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,023
we get to share a bed with somebody
at the same time.

303
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,151
We were frightened of being left alone
for the rest of our lives.

304
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,153
Only people of a certain disposition

305
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,073
are frightened of being left alone
for the rest of their lives at 26.

306
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,116
We were of that disposition.

307
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,829
- So, when she told me...
- I met someone else.

308
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,461
- Who?
- Just someone else.

309
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,965
...it was contrary
to the whole spirit of our arrangement.

310
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,181
So, how come I got dumped?

311
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,599
What?

312
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,232
- Hey, Dick, come on in. What is it?
- Oh, um,

313
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,694
well, we're going to Lounge Ax,
and I was just wondering,

314
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,655
if you wanted to come along with us.

315
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,657
Whoa!

316
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,034
Um, Marie De Salle's playing.

317
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,537
You remember
I told you about her today? I like her.

318
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:10,292
She's kind of Sheryl Crow-ish,
crossed with a post-Partridge Family,

319
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,794
pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing.

320
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,590
- But, you know, black.
- Yeah.

321
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:20,635
So, I just wanted to know
if you wanted to come along.

322
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,681
Barry thought so, too, really,
but I guess it looks as if

323
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,476
- you're reorganizing your records.
- Reorganizing my records.

324
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,689
- What is it? Chronological?
- No.

325
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,401
- Not alphabetical.
- Nope.

326
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:41,740
- What?
- Autobiographical.

327
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,409
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

328
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,578
I can tell you
how I got from Deep Purple

329
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,914
to Howlin' Wolf in just 25 moves.

330
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,749
Oh, my God.

331
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,751
And if I want to find the song Landslide

332
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,045
by Fleetwood Mac, I have to remember

333
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:59,549
that I bought it for someone
in the fall of 1983 pile,

334
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,928
but didn't give it to them
for personal reasons.

335
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,597
- That sounds...
- Comforting.

336
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,223
- Yes.
- It is.

337
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,477
Hello?

338
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,438
Well, shit, I can stick around,
you know, man,

339
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,815
if you want me to help out.

340
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,817
But you really shouldn't
keep them piled like this

341
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,154
- because it gets pressured...
- Hold on. See you tomorrow.

342
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,824
- Oh. Okay. I'll see you.
- Okay.

343
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,826
Hi, Mom.

344
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,496
How's the store?

345
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,874
You're very lucky that Laura
is doing as well as she's doing.

346
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,336
Because if it wasn't for her, I don't
think either of us would ever sleep.

347
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,048
She left. She's gone.

348
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,801
What? What do you mean?

349
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,470
- Where did she go?
- How would I know where?

350
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,847
She's gone. Girlfriend leave.

351
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,934
Not say where gone. Laura move out.

352
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,270
- Well, call her mother.
- She just called.

353
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:58,233
She doesn't even know. Probably
the last time I'll ever hear her voice.

354
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,950
I'm all right, if that's
what's upsetting you.

355
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,870
- That is not what's upsetting me.
- It fuckin' should be, shouldn't it?

356
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,498
I knew this would happen.
What are you gonna do, Rob?

357
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,667
I'm gonna drink wine.
I'm gonna watch TV and go to bed.

358
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,669
- Then I'm gonna go to work.
- And then what?

359
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,255
I'm gonna meet a girl, have children,
and the next time we talk

360
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,257
- I'll have it all figured out, okay?
- I knew!

361
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,343
- I knew it was gonna happen.
- What are you getting so upset about?

362
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,345
- You know why she left.
- It's got nothing to do with marriage.

363
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,266
- So you say.
- Mom? I'm telling you, for the last time.

364
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,268
Laura didn't even want to get married.

365
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,895
She's not that kind of girl.
That's not what happens now.

366
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,648
Oh, I don't know what happens now.

367
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,027
Apart from, you meet someone,
you move in, she goes!

368
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,363
You meet someone,
you move in, she goes!

369
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,741
Shut up, Mom. Goddamn!

370
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,493
That's some cold shit.

371
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,917
John Dillinger was shot dead behind
that theater in a hail of FBI gunfire.

372
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:02,047
You know who tipped them off?
His fuckin' girlfriend.

373
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,090
He just wanted to go to the movies.

374
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,312
Is that Peter fucking Frampton?

375
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,534
Don't
Don't hesitate

376
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,871
'Cause our love

377
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,209
Just won't wait

378
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:45,465
Ooh, baby
I love your way

379
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,136
- Rob!
- What?

380
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,474
I always hated that song.

381
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,518
- Yeah.
- Now I kinda like it.

382
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,897
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

383
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,489
She should have done
The Number Four with a Smile.

384
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,992
Wasn't her record called,
Number Four with a Smile?

385
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,620
- That's what I said.
- No, no. You said The Number Four.

386
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,622
There's no "The" at the front.

387
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,458
It's a reference to
a Chinese meal in Toronto.

388
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,460
So I think that there is a "The,"

389
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,921
- but I could be wrong.
- You can be,

390
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,090
and are wrong.

391
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:36,474
I wanna be with you night and day

392
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,768
I want to date a musician.

393
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,105
I want to live with a musician.

394
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,941
She'd write songs at home,
and ask me what I thought of 'em,

395
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,361
and maybe even include one of our
private little jokes in the liner notes.

396
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,657
Maybe a little picture of me
in the liner notes.

397
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,993
Just in the background somewhere.

398
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,830
Don't hesitate

399
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,259
- So, uh, you live in Chicago now?
- I do.

400
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,928
- Do you love it?
- You should come to our record store.

401
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,139
- Championship Vinyl.
- Oh, my God. You'd love it.

402
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,600
- He owns it. It's on Milwaukee...
- You'll find everything.

403
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,061
- Soul, trip-hop, salsa...
- Ska, techno...

404
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,898
- Will you come? Championship Vinyl.
- It sounds okay.

405
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,941
- Enjoyed your set.
- Thank you.

406
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,903
Why did you tell her about the store?

407
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,114
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was classified information.

408
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,159
I know we don't have any customers,
but I thought that was a bad thing,

409
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,328
not a business strategy.

410
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,719
Rob?

411
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,723
It's Liz. Just calling to see if,

412
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,601
you know, well, you're okay.

413
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:07,357
Look, I'm your friend, too,
so I'm not taking sides yet.

414
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,236
Give me a call, okay? Bye.

415
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,060
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

416
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,813
- Took the morning off.
- Come on, Rob.

417
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,565
Do you still love me?

418
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,405
- Well, it's not really the issue.
- Why? What else is there?

419
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,407
What do you mean? What else is there?

420
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,200
I don't know!

421
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,454
But it doesn't change the way
we don't get along at all.

422
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,624
In fact, I hope we're
not in love anymore, to be honest.

423
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,585
It would give me a better opinion
of love right now.

424
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,879
Did I beat you?
Did I tell you you were a bad person?

425
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,132
I mean, what the fuck?

426
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,466
What should I have done
to make you happy?

427
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,136
Nothing. Make yourself happy.

428
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,056
- Why am I not happy?
- Because

429
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,518
you're the same person you used to be.

430
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,769
And I'm not.

431
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,775
- And all I've done is changed jobs.
- And clothes and hairstyles.

432
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,153
- Attitudes and friends.
- I couldn't go to work

433
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,822
- with my hair dyed pink.
- You're harder.

434
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,658
You haven't changed so much
as a pair of socks since I've known you.

435
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,786
- Come on, Laura, you're being stupid.
- You used to talk about the future.

436
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,289
Now you don't even do that.

437
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,915
I'm all right.
You're the one that hates her job.

438
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,959
You haven't got a clue.

439
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:53,171
I like my job.

440
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,049
All I'm saying is, you have to allow
for things to happen to people.

441
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,509
Most of all, to yourself.

442
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,387
You don't, Rob.

443
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,431
So what's the use?

444
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,861
Rob! It's your turn.

445
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
Okay. I'm feeling kind of basic today.

446
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,950
Top five side ones. Track ones.

447
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,244
Janie Jones, Clash. From The Clash.

448
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,706
Let's Get It On, Marvin Gaye,
from Let's Get It On.

449
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,209
Nirvana, Smells Like Teen Spirit,
off Nevermind.

450
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,544
Oh, no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.
Not at all.

451
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,465
How about Point ofKnow Return
on Point of Know Return?

452
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,674
Shut up, shut up.

453
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,885
White Light/White Heat,
Velvet Underground.

454
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,012
- That would be on my list.
- Not on mine.

455
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,057
Massive Attack,
No Protection, the song is

456
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,560
- Radiation Ruling the Nation.
- Oh, kind of a new record.

457
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,562
- Very... In a minute.
- Excuse me, I was...

458
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,608
Very nice, Rob.
A sly declaration of new classic status

459
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,610
slipped into a list of old safe ones.

460
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,072
- Very pussy!
- Excuse me, I was...

461
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,741
In a minute. Couldn't you be
any more obvious than that, Rob?

462
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,035
How about, I don't know, The Beatles?

463
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,329
How about fucking Beethoven?

464
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,832
Track one, side one
of the Fifth Symphony?

465
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,585
How can someone who has no interest
in music own a record store?

466
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,797
Do you still have that
Beefheart French import Safe As Milk?

467
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,507
Um...

468
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:24,554
Let's see.

469
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,266
Ah! Yes, here it is.

470
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,481
Yes.

471
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,526
- How much you want for it?
- Uh...

472
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,240
Oh, no. You know what?
I don't think I'm selling it this week.

473
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,701
- Maybe next week.
- Oh, no. You said that last week.

474
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,078
Did I? Yeah, well, I just...

475
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,873
I...

476
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,875
Nicely played.

477
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,294
You know, I don't have that record.
Buy it for $40.

478
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,505
- Rob?
- Sold.

479
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,632
Now, why would you sell it
to me and not to him?

480
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,302
- Because you're not a geek, Louis.
- You guys are snobs.

481
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,888
- No, we're not.
- No, seriously. You're totally elitist.

482
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,223
You feel like the unappreciated scholar,

483
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,808
so you shit on the people
who know less than you.

484
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,893
No!

485
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,687
- Which is everybody.
- Yes.

486
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,689
It's just sad, that's all.

487
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,946
I'm sick of
the sight of this place.

488
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,990
Some days, I'm afraid I'll go berserk.

489
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,493
Throw the Country "A" through "K" rack
out on the street

490
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,037
and go work at a Virgin Megastore
and never come back.

491
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,543
- Hello?
- Hey, Liz.

492
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:41,506
- Hey, Rob.
- I just wanted to call and thank you

493
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,508
for that message you sent me last night.

494
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,801
It really made me feel
like less of an asshole.

495
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:50,973
Well. How are you holding up?

496
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,351
Good, good. I mean, look.

497
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,103
Maybe we're just not right
for each other. Or maybe we are.

498
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,731
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- Time will tell at this point,

499
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,442
and if it's time to move on,
it's time to move on.

500
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:06,280
I don't know. I don't want to take sides.

501
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,033
And I like you with Laura.
I think you guys are good together.

502
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,454
And I don't think much of this lan guy.

503
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,875
Rob, Marie De Salle is in the store.

504
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,214
I've gotta go, Liz.

505
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,178
- We should maybe turn off her music.
- I know.

506
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,640
Hey. Like the music.

507
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,309
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I can go turn it off if you want.

508
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,687
You might be sick of it.

509
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,940
- You should turn it up.
- Oh, right. Yeah. Okay.

510
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,151
Let me go do that, after I do
something else that I have to go do.

511
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,780
- All righty.
- Yeah, I got the... Excuse me.

512
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,629
What fucking lan guy?

513
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,883
Laura doesn't know anybody called lan.

514
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,927
There's no lan in her office.

515
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,929
She has no friends called lan!

516
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,933
I'm almost certain she has never
met anyone named lan in her life.

517
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,352
She lives in an

518
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,731
"lan-less" universe.

519
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,949
"I. Raymond."

520
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,038
Ray. "I."

521
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,206
Ian.

522
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,251
Mr. I. Raymond, "Ray" to his friends,

523
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,420
and more importantly to his neighbor.

524
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,673
The guy who, until about
six weeks ago, lived upstairs.

525
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,967
I start to remember things
about him now.

526
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,345
His horrible clothes and hair.

527
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,347
His music, Latin and Bulgarian,

528
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,557
whatever world music
was trendy that week.

529
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,559
He had rings on his fingers.

530
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,561
Awful cooking smells.

531
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,648
I never liked him much then,
and I fuckin' hate him now.

532
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,870
We used to listen to him having sex.

533
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,916
Upstairs.

534
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,719
Jeez, he goes on long enough.

535
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:38,849
I should be so lucky.

536
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,657
It feels so good

537
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,660
You are as abandoned and noisy
as any character in a porn film.

538
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,204
You are lan's plaything,
responding to his touch

539
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,540
with shrieks of orgasmic delight.

540
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,543
No woman in the history of the world
is having better sex

541
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,545
than the sex you are having with lan

542
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,588
in my head.

543
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,842
Oh, baby
Give it up

544
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,053
Ain't no use

545
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:30,067
Number five. Jackie Alden.

546
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,570
Jackie Alden's breakup

547
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,572
had no effect on my life whatsoever.

548
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,991
It was a casual thing,
and I was glad when it ended.

549
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,078
I just slotted her in
to bump Laura out of position.

550
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,915
But now, congratulations, Laura.

551
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,251
You made it to the top five.

552
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,672
Number five with a bullet. Welcome.

553
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,593
Won't somebody please

554
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:59,472
Help me with my misery

555
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,477
Can't somebody see

556
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,730
Hey! Do you have Soul?

557
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,816
What this one girl's done to me

558
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,611
That all depends.

559
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,615
Back row, right next to the Blues.

560
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,658
Championship Vinyl.

561
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,414
Yeah. Yeah, I'm interested. Sure.

562
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,250
What's your address?

563
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,504
Hey, Liz.

564
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,840
Hey, Rob. You fucking asshole!

565
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,348
Hi, Barry.

566
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,227
Soarin' and borin'

567
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:50,815
I feel I'm ignorin'

568
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:55,986
My time in the world
Have you heard

569
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,823
For a couple of years,
I was the deejay at a club.

570
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,033
I was good at it, I think.

571
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,661
And while I was doing it,
it's the happiest I've ever been.

572
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,663
And, that's where I met Laura.

573
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,002
She was already a lawyer,
but she worked for Legal Aid,

574
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,004
hence the leatherjacket
and the clubbing.

575
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,340
Oh, I liked her right away.

576
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,009
- Hey!
- Hey!

577
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,929
That's a kick-ass record.

578
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,306
- What?
- That's a kick-ass record.

579
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,268
Yeah, I know.

580
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,357
- Um... What's your name?
- Laura!

581
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,781
Hey! I was gonna say, come back
next week and I'll make you a tape.

582
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,701
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay?

583
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,161
- Rob.
- I'm still Laura.

584
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,708
To be honest, I hadn't met
anyone as promising as Laura

585
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,627
since I started deejaying,
and meeting promising women

586
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,380
is kind of what the deejaying thing
is supposed to be about.

587
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,594
And anyway, we...
We moved on from there.

588
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,264
She lost her lease
on her apartment in Lakeview

589
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,683
and she moved in with me.

590
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,685
And it stayed that way for years.

591
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,566
She didn't make me miserable,
or anxious,

592
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,568
or ill-at-ease.

593
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:23,449
And, you know, it sounds boring,
but it wasn't.

594
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:28,162
It wasn't spectacular, either. It was just

595
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,497
good.

596
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,960
But really good.

597
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:39,006
So. How come
I'm suddenly an asshole?

598
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:50,392
I get the feeling
that Liz talked to Laura.

599
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,437
And Liz stuck up for me.

600
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,315
And Laura told her a few things.

601
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,317
I don't know what precisely Laura said,

602
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,779
but she would have revealed
at least two, maybe even all four

603
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,239
of the following pieces of information.

604
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,831
- One, that I slept with someone else...
- He slept with somebody else.

605
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:17,086
- What?
...while she, Laura, was pregnant.

606
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,131
- While I was pregnant.
- No!

607
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:26,345
Two. That my affair
directly contributed...

608
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,181
...pretty much directly to me
terminating the pregnancy.

609
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,141
No.

610
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,645
Three, that after the abortion,

611
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,855
I borrowed a large sum
of money from her...

612
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,148
...four grand or so...

613
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,734
...and have not, as of yet,
repaid any of it.

614
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,738
- Bastard!
- Four.

615
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,658
That shortly before she left me,

616
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,496
I told her that I was kind of
unhappy in the relationship.

617
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,875
And maybe sort of looking around
for someone else.

618
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,212
He was "sort of, maybe,"
looking around for somebody else.

619
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,339
Did I do and say those things?

620
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,633
- Yes.
- No!

621
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,635
Yes, I did.

622
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,349
- I am a fuckin' asshole.
- That's it.

623
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,519
Liz. No, sit down. Sit down.

624
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,898
That's shocking.

625
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,942
That is shocking.

626
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,200
First of all, the money.

627
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,661
Laura had it, and I didn't.

628
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,164
And she wanted to give it to me.

629
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,042
I've never been able to pay her back

630
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,502
because I've never been able to.

631
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,088
Just because she moved in
with some Supertramp fan

632
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,466
it doesn't make me five grand richer.

633
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,136
And number two, this stuff about me
half-looking around for someone else,

634
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,138
she tricked me into saying it.

635
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,515
We were having this
State-of-the-Union-type conversation,

636
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,852
and she said, matter-of-factly, that we
were pretty unhappy at the moment.

637
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,229
And did I agree? And I said yes.

638
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:03,484
And she asked me whether I ever
thought about meeting other people.

639
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,653
So, then I asked her if she ever
thought about meeting someone else.

640
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,323
She says, "Of course."
So I admit that, yes,

641
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,617
I daydream about it from time to time.

642
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,119
Now, I can see what we were
really talking about,

643
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,581
is her and lan, and she
suckered me into absolving her.

644
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,250
It was a sneaky lawyer's trick.

645
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,253
And I fell for it because

646
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,589
she's much smarter than me.

647
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,554
All right. Then the pregnancy.

648
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,516
I didn't know she was pregnant.

649
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,937
Of course I didn't. I didn't know
because she hadn't told me.

650
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,690
She hadn't told me because I
had told her that I had sort...

651
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,610
Yes, I'd slept with someone else,
so I didn't find out she was pregnant

652
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,612
till way later.

653
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,116
We were going through
this good period,

654
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,742
and I made some crack
about having kids.

655
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:54,827
What?

656
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,163
She just burst into tears, and I said,
"Well, what is it?" you know.

657
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,707
And I made her tell me, and she did,

658
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,836
and I went into this brief and
ill-advised bout of self-righteousness.

659
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,046
You know, "What right do you have?
My child, too."

660
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,423
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

661
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,222
That pretty much brings us up to date.

662
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,393
Who needs a drink?

663
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,399
Who loves the sun

664
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,487
Who cares that
it makes plants grow

665
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,242
What's wrong with me? Seriously.

666
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,870
What happened?

667
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,749
Why am I doomed to be left?

668
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,419
Doomed to be rejected?

669
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,421
I need answers.

670
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,178
Number one. Alison Ashmore.

671
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,183
- Hello? Hi.
- This is Rob Gordon calling.

672
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,020
- I'm an old friend of Alison's. And...
- What did you say your name was?

673
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,355
Rob. Rob Gordon.

674
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,567
I was actually her first boyfriend

675
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,027
in the seventh grade,

676
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,112
and I was just wondering
if you had any way of reaching her.

677
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,239
- Her number, or...
- I hate to quibble with you, Rob,

678
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,909
but Alison married her first boyfriend.

679
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,537
Kevin Bannister.
He is her first and last boyfriend.

680
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:24,166
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm quite serious.

681
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,170
She is Mrs. Kevin Bannister,
and she lives in Australia.

682
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,796
We went out together
in the seventh grade.

683
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,465
I beg your pardon.

684
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,593
Well, technically,
I'm her first boyfriend, okay?

685
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,595
I met her a few days before Kevin did.

686
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,930
Technically, number one. Me.

687
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,308
I don't know what you mean
by "technically."

688
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,019
You know, I'm number one.
Me. Technically.

689
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,188
I see. Well, maybe it's my mistake.

690
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,441
I've got to go now, Bob. Okay, bye-bye.

691
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,744
Alison married Kevin!

692
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,956
I am fine now.

693
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,125
Married her
junior high school sweetheart.

694
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,213
Kissed me on the bench, kissed Kevin
on the bench, married Kevin.

695
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,050
This is great!
It's got nothing to do with me.

696
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,344
This is fate. This is destiny.

697
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,181
It is beyond my control.
Beyond my fault. I love this!

698
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:29,106
I want more. I want to see
the others on the big top five.

699
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,817
I want to see Penny,
and Charlie and Sarah, all of them!

700
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,611
You know, just see 'em and talk to 'em.

701
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,613
You know,
like a Bruce Springsteen song.

702
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:40,867
You call, you ask 'em how they are,
and you see if they've forgiven you.

703
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,705
Yeah, and then... And then I'd feel good.

704
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,914
And they'd feel good.

705
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:50,043
No, they'd feel good maybe,
but you'd feel better.

706
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,214
I'd feel clean and calm.

707
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,801
That's what you're looking for.
You want to get ready to start again,

708
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,053
that'd be good for you.

709
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,390
Great, even.

710
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,727
You'd give that big final good luck
and goodbye to your all-time top five,

711
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,187
and just move on down the road.

712
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,525
Good luck, goodbye.

713
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,737
Thanks, Boss.

714
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,491
Penny is as beautiful
as she was in high school

715
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,493
and really grown into herself.

716
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,163
She reviews movies for a living,
which is unassailably cool,

717
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:30,459
even if she does make these little
notes with this little flashlight pen.

718
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,170
We have a good time,
and we hate the same actors,

719
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,797
and everything's goin' great.

720
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,383
She tells me about her life,
I tell her about mine.

721
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,802
We both get it. We both relate.

722
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:45,515
And then, with no real explanation,
I just launch into it.

723
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,143
I tell her about how Laura
wanted to sleep with lan and not me.

724
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,687
Charlie wanted to sleep
with Marco and not me.

725
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,523
Alison Ashmore wanted
Kevin Bannister and not me.

726
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,025
And you, you wanted to...

727
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,403
You wanted to have sex
with Chris Thompson and not me.

728
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,656
And I was hoping you could help me
understand why this keeps happening.

729
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,285
Why, you know, I'm doomed to be left.
Doomed to be rejected.

730
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,287
Do you understand?

731
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,210
Um, well,
I was crazy about you.

732
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:18,090
I wanted to sleep with you one day,
but not when I was 16.

733
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:22,344
You know, when you broke up with me,
you broke up with me,

734
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,264
because I was, to use
your charming expression, "tight,"

735
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,726
I cried and I cried and I hated you,
and when that little shitbag

736
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,937
asked me out, and I was
too tired to fight him off,

737
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,273
it wasn't rape, because I said okay,
but it wasn't far off!

738
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,777
You know I couldn't have sex until after
college because I hated it so much?

739
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:43,740
That's when you're supposed to
have sex, Rob. In college!

740
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,576
And now you want to have
a little chat about rejection!

741
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,162
Well, fuck you, Rob!

742
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,628
My God, she's right.

743
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:00,340
I broke up with her. I rejected her.

744
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,842
That's another one
I don't have to worry about.

745
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,094
I should have done this years ago.

746
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,555
- Ma'am? Can I get the check, please?
- Right away, sir.

747
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,851
Next up, Charlie.

748
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,105
But I'm not quite ready for that.

749
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,525
So I go directly to number four
on the all-time breakup list.

750
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,362
Sarah, my partner in rejection,
who rejected me.

751
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:26,992
- Hi, Rob.
- Hi.

752
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,454
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

753
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,290
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
- Nice to see you.

754
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,542
- Want me to come...
- You want... Okay, let's go out.

755
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,421
I can't believe I left you for him.

756
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,256
Probably seemed like
a good idea at the time.

757
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,049
I don't know why, though.

758
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:51,475
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Um, no, yeah.

759
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,978
- No? No.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm in between things.

760
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,647
- How are you doing?
- Me? Not good.

761
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,983
- Really?
- No.

762
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,653
Oh, it's so hard.
The medication I was on is not working.

763
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,239
So, we're trying something else,
but it's like they don't know about it,

764
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,909
so I'm like a guinea pig, and...
But I'm making money. That's good.

765
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,995
I lost my job a month ago.
So it's been like hand to mouth...

766
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,498
No, I haven't got the
heart for the rejection conversation.

767
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,874
There are no hard feelings,

768
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,752
and I'm glad she ditched me
and not the other way around.

769
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,754
I'll call you. Nice to see you.

770
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,756
- Fine. Bye. See you later.
- You, too.

771
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,137
I could have
wound up having sex back there.

772
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,431
And what better way
to exorcise rejection demons

773
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,059
than to screw the person
who rejected you, right?

774
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,186
But you wouldn't be
sleeping with a person.

775
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,688
You'd be sleeping with a whole,
sad, single-person culture.

776
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,232
It would be like sleeping with

777
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,068
Talia Shire in Rocky,
if you weren't Rocky.

778
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,654
I feel guilty enough as it is.

779
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,656
There's only Charlie left now.

780
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:54,663
She's in the fuckin' phone book.

781
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,706
She should be living on Neptune.

782
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,961
She's an extraterrestrial, a ghost,
a myth, not a person in a phone book.

783
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,010
Hello, this is Charlie.

784
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,221
Answering machine.
I'll leave a nice, polite message

785
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,265
and she'll never call back.

786
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,520
The Killing Moon EP is almost
impossible to find, especially on CD.

787
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,896
Yet another cruel trick

788
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,566
played on all the dumb-asses
who got rid of their turntables.

789
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,276
But every other
Echo and the Bunnymen album...

790
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,610
I have all the other ones.

791
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,904
Oh, you do? Well,
how about The Jesus and Mary Chain?

792
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,656
- They always seemed...
- They always seemed what?

793
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,825
They always seemed really great
is what they always seemed.

794
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,827
They picked up where
your precious Echo left off

795
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,829
and you're complaining
about no more Echo albums.

796
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,832
I can't believe you don't own
this fucking record! That's insane!

797
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,417
Jesus!

798
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,463
Well, the interesting thing
about Green Day is that

799
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,593
so much of their music is,
in truth, directly influenced by,

800
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,928
in my opinion, two bands.

801
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,264
- The Clash...
- The Clash!

802
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,434
Uh, correct, The Clash. But also,

803
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,937
by this band called Stiff Little Fingers.

804
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:07,861
Um, I think you would
really love this band.

805
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,957
It sounds great.

806
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:28,465
- My name's Anaugh.
- The name's... My name's Dick.

807
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,801
Is this the new Green Day?

808
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:38,266
You don't have it? That is perverse.

809
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,728
Don't tell anybody you don't own
fucking Blonde on Blonde.

810
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,067
It's gonna be okay.

811
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:54,074
I will now sell five copies
of The Three E.P. 's by The Beta Band.

812
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,241
Good.

813
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,087
There is something inside
that you want to say

814
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,090
Say it out loud
It'll be okay

815
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:16,680
I will be all right
I will be all right

816
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,683
There's something inside
That you wanna say

817
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,226
You can say it out loud
It'll be okay

818
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,520
- Who is that?
- It's the Beta Band.

819
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,439
- It's good.
- I know.

820
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,159
- Barry! The door!
- Fuck!

821
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,620
Go! Go!

822
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,836
Hey! Okay, fuckos.

823
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,796
How much is this deck worth,
and how much did you steal?

824
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,465
Can you do the math?
Barry, call the cops.

825
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,467
- No!
- No, hold up. Hold up.

826
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,181
Ryuichi Sakamoto,

827
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,602
Sigue Sigue Sputnik,
Breakbeats, Serge Gainsbourg.

828
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,563
What are you guys,
stealing for other people?

829
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,814
No, those are for us.

830
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,274
You guys slamming
to Joni Mitchell now?

831
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,483
You're like, so bigoted.

832
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,235
To look at us, and think
you know what we listen to.

833
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,611
I think you have more.

834
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,114
God, man!

835
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,302
Hi.

836
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,304
What do you want?

837
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,015
I thought I could give you a ride back.

838
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:48,271
- Are you coming home?
- Yeah.

839
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,358
Well, I'd like to come over
to your house to pick up some things.

840
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,654
My house.

841
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:10,168
- How'd it go today?
- All right.

842
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:14,005
- Do you wanna go?
- Sure.

843
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,647
So, have you tackled
the Great Reorganization yet?

844
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:35,109
You bet.
You can take this with you if you want.

845
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:39,656
Look at this place, Laura, it's a dump.

846
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,700
What are you making now?
60, 70 a year?

847
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,953
And you were living in this shithole.

848
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,747
Bet you can't even remember
what you were doing here.

849
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,625
I was here because
I wanted to be with you.

850
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,419
It had nothing to do with this place.

851
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,548
So, uh, where are you staying now?

852
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,801
I think you know that.

853
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,886
I had to work that out for myself,
though, didn't I?

854
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,137
I'm sorry.

855
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,890
I know I haven't been very fair.

856
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,726
That's why I came to the store tonight.

857
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,729
It took me a while
to work up the courage.

858
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,899
- You scared now?
- Yes, of course I am.

859
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,069
I feel terrible, Rob.
You know, this is really hard.

860
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,822
Good.

861
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:25,827
So, how is everything going with lan?

862
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,037
Is it working out okay?

863
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,874
- You're living with the guy.
- Don't.

864
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,667
I'm just asking how it's going.

865
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,503
Look, I'm not living with the guy, okay?

866
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,173
I'm just staying with him for a few days
until I figure out what I'm doing.

867
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,429
I left because we weren't exactly getting
along, and we weren't talking about it.

868
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,389
I'm getting to a point where
I want to get my shit together

869
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,475
and I can't really see that
ever happening with you.

870
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:53,271
And, yes, I sort of got
interested in someone else.

871
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,315
And that went further
than it should have,

872
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,067
so it seemed like a good time to go.

873
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,823
But I have no idea what will
happen with lan in the long run.

874
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,869
Probably nothing.

875
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,085
So, what?

876
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,672
You definitely haven't
decided to dump me? Is that it?

877
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,634
There's still a chance
we might get back together?

878
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,802
I don't know.

879
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,888
Well, if you don't know,

880
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,892
there's a chance, right?

881
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,981
I mean, it would be like

882
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,233
if someone was in the hospital
and he was seriously ill,

883
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,528
and the doctor said, "I don't know if
this patient has a chance of survival,"

884
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,530
that doesn't mean the patient's
definitely gonna die, does it?

885
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,782
I mean, he might live.

886
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,284
- Even if it's a remote possibility.
- I suppose so.

887
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,119
- So we have a chance.
- Shut up, Rob.

888
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,872
I just want to know,
what chance do we have?

889
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,457
I don't know what chance.

890
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,209
If you could tell me roughly...

891
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,088
All right, we have a 9% chance
of getting back together.

892
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,465
- Nine?
- Nine.

893
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,633
Great.

894
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,093
Look, I know I'm asking a lot,

895
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,804
but could you take off for a while
so I can get my stuff packed up?

896
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,389
No problem.

897
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,433
- You want me to leave my own house?
- Yes, please.

898
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:21,484
Laura, can I ask you one question?

899
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,278
Yes. One.

900
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:27,156
You're not gonna like it.

901
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,617
Just ask it.

902
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,996
Is it better?

903
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,165
Is what better? Better than what?

904
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,878
Well, sex, I guess. Is it better?

905
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,673
Is that really
what's bothering you?

906
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,634
Yes. Yes, of course.

907
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,263
Do you really think
it would make a difference either way?

908
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,641
- I don't know.
- Well, the answer is, I don't know either.

909
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,227
We haven't done it yet.

910
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,689
Never?

911
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,733
I haven't felt like it.

912
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,235
Not even before,
when he was living upstairs?

913
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,196
No. I was living with you, remember?

914
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,159
We've slept together,
but we haven't made love.

915
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,288
Not yet.

916
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,542
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What?

917
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,172
Sleeping together is better.

918
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,425
Sleeping together is better?

919
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,054
But not the sex,
because you haven't done it yet?

920
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,973
- Will you please just go?
- Yeah.

921
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:39,479
We are the champions
My friends

922
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,690
Yes! Put 'em up!

923
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:46,360
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end

924
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:49,489
I feel good. I feel great.

925
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:55,078
I feel like a new man.
I feel so much better, in fact,

926
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,747
that I go straight out
and sleep with Marie De Salle.

927
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,083
No time for losers

928
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:05,171
'Cause we are the champions

929
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,594
"How could this
have happened?" you ask.

930
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,765
"How does he... How does he do it?"

931
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,101
How does a regular guy like me

932
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,270
become the number one lover man
in his postal district?

933
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:25,942
He's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out
with the musical moron twins,

934
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,279
and yet he gets to go to bed
with somebody like Marie De Salle.

935
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:34,408
Hey. Marie.

936
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,619
- Everything go all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

937
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,373
She just wanted to pick up some stuff,
you know. It was no big deal. It was...

938
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,043
I hate that time. Picking-up-stuff time.

939
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,046
You know that song I play,
Eartha Kitt Times Two?

940
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,214
Of course!

941
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,968
I wrote that about me and my ex
dividing our record collection.

942
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,970
Great, great song.

943
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,848
A while back, Dick, Barry and I agreed

944
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,976
that what really matters is what you like

945
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,687
not what you are like.

946
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,148
Books, records, films,
these things matter.

947
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,984
Call me shallow. It's the fucking truth.

948
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,903
And by this measure, I was having
one of the best dates of my life.

949
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,656
- You love that show?
- Yes!

950
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,534
Starring... Starring...
Who starred in The Prisoner?

951
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,494
- McGoohan.
- That's right!

952
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:22,665
And then, we talk about our exes.

953
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,127
She's dry and self-deprecating.

954
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,879
Great sense of humor about it,

955
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,672
and I can really see
why her songs are so good.

956
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,174
I guess she's happy.

957
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,968
I don't speak about Laura
with as much depth.

958
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,221
But it feels, even to me,
like I'm being intimate.

959
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,349
I express regret,
I say nice things about her,

960
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:45,646
and I hint at a deep ocean
of melancholy just below the surface.

961
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,649
Which is all bullshit, really.

962
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:52,528
I've just invented a sketch
of a decent, sensitive guy,

963
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:55,323
because I'm in the position
to invent him.

964
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:59,493
And I guess all that charming,
nervous stuff seems to work somehow,

965
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:03,164
because we get back to her house and

966
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,793
it just happens.

967
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,425
And then we make love. It's great.

968
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,845
And that's it. I'm not gonna
go into all that other stuff.

969
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,014
You know,
the who-did-what-to-whom stuff.

970
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,642
You know that song
Behind Closed Doors by Charlie Rich?

971
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,770
It's one of my favorite songs.

972
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,313
I can say we had a good time.

973
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,316
I can say that.

974
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,485
Marie's a terrific woman.

975
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,242
And then, in the morning...

976
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,078
You didn't have me fooled,

977
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:47,541
acting all cool
about, um, what's-her-name.

978
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:52,713
- Laura.
- Laura, right, right. Laura.

979
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,675
What was yours called again?

980
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,095
It was called James.

981
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,180
- James.
- James.

982
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,808
Do you miss him?

983
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,061
Yeah.

984
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,231
That's how it works, right?

985
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:15,236
I think it's okay if you feel horny
and fucked up at the same time.

986
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,697
Why should we be denied
our basic human rights,

987
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,824
just 'cause we messed up
our relationships?

988
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,827
You think sex is a basic human right?

989
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,705
Hell, yeah! Yeah.

990
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,752
I'm not gonna let that asshole
come between me and a fuck.

991
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,717
- Which way are you going?
- That way. You?

992
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,095
- That way.
- Ah, so it is.

993
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,562
- Talk to you.
- I'll call you.

994
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,356
Right.

995
01:00:56,111 --> 01:01:00,031
What did Laura mean last night when
she said, "I haven't slept with him yet"?

996
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:03,284
Yet! What does "yet" mean anyway?

997
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,662
It means you're gonna do it,
doesn't it? Or does it?

998
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,665
Just come on. What would it mean
to you, that sentence,

999
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,169
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet"?

1000
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,795
Well, to me it would mean
that you're a liar.

1001
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,674
You've seen it twice. Once with Laura,
oops, and once with me and Dick.

1002
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:19,967
We had that conversation

1003
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,845
about that guy making shotgun ammo
off-screen in the 14th century.

1004
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,930
Right. But let's just say
that I hadn't seen it.

1005
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,183
And I said, "I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet."

1006
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,351
What would you think?

1007
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:32,521
I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot,
and I'd feel sorry for you.

1008
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,940
All right. But from that one sentence,

1009
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,360
would you think that
I was going to see it?

1010
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,779
I'm sorry, Rob. I'm struggling here.

1011
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:42,490
You're asking me what would I think
if you told me

1012
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,368
you hadn't seen a film
that you have already seen.

1013
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,703
Just listen to me. If I said to you...

1014
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:50,581
"I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yes.

1015
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,459
Would you get the impression
that I really wanted to see it?

1016
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,754
Oh, well, you couldn't have been
desperate to see it,

1017
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,756
otherwise you'd have already gone.

1018
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,133
Right. I'm not gonna see that movie.

1019
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:09,058
But the word "yet."
Yeah, you know what?

1020
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,894
I get the impression
that you wanted to see it,

1021
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,064
otherwise you'd have said
you didn't want to go.

1022
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,274
But in your opinion,
would I definitely go?

1023
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,944
How the fuck am I supposed to know?
Probably.

1024
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,947
- Why?
- Because it's a brilliant film.

1025
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:27,952
It's so funny and violent,
and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

1026
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,415
I never thought I'd say this,
but can I go work now?

1027
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,250
Look, Laura, if you don't want me
to call you at work,

1028
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,876
then give me your home number.

1029
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,878
Oh, I forgot. You can't.

1030
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,257
I'm not gonna get off this phone
until you agree to meet me for a drink.

1031
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,716
I'm sorry, but I don't see

1032
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,636
why this has to be on your terms
all the time, really.

1033
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,264
Okay, okay! We'll meet, then, tonight.

1034
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,850
That'd be great if you're not too busy.

1035
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:54,270
It'll be really good to see you.

1036
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,869
So, how are you?

1037
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,996
Have you slept with him yet?

1038
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,667
Is that why you wanted to see me?

1039
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,878
I guess.

1040
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,257
What do you want me to say?

1041
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:27,720
I want you to say you haven't,
and I want that to be the truth.

1042
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,516
I can't do that.

1043
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,098
You must have known it would happen.

1044
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,101
You couldn't have been
entirely unprepared like you said.

1045
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,187
I've been living with the guy.

1046
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,272
We were bound
to get around to it sometime.

1047
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:25,736
Rob, are you there?
What are you thinking?

1048
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,367
We can meet for another drink
if you want.

1049
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,036
So I can explain it better.
I owe you that much.

1050
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,372
I don't have your number.

1051
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:39,041
I don't want this to be
the last conversation we have.

1052
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,460
- I know what you're like.
- You do, huh?

1053
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,635
I need a second opinion.

1054
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,434
Hi, this is Tim. City and state, please.

1055
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,146
Uh, Chicago. A residence.
Mr. Ian Raymond.

1056
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,482
- Please hold for that number.
- May I also have that address?

1057
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,025
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

1058
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:43,105
- Rob?
- Laura, I just want to say something.

1059
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,775
I think you're running,
you're running from a sharp point

1060
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,404
that anybody hits in any relationship,
and it's just gonna happen again.

1061
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,532
But it's gonna be with this guy lan,
later, when you're older.

1062
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,244
With a guy with
a Steven Seagal ponytail.

1063
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:00,706
You know what I'm saying?
And he doesn't love you.

1064
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,417
And he doesn't understand you,
not the way I will.

1065
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,629
And I will even more so in the future.

1066
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,345
I mean, if you want
to experiment or whatever...

1067
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:17,556
I'm not experimenting.
Why don't you go experiment?

1068
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,768
- Laura, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1069
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,144
Is that him?

1070
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,563
Look, can you call me at work?

1071
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,523
I gotta go now.

1072
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,819
You look upset.

1073
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,614
Yeah, I'm upset, but I'm fine.

1074
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:37,034
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1075
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,578
Conflict resolution is my job.

1076
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:42,289
Yeah, I know. But, lan,
there's really nothing to resolve.

1077
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,457
But thank you.

1078
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,589
You have got to stop calling her.

1079
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,675
You're really upsetting her, and him!

1080
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,219
- Like I care about him.
- Well, you should.

1081
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:56,512
Why?

1082
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,639
Because all you're doing
is forming a little unit.

1083
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,848
Them against you!

1084
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,476
Before you started all this
psychotic madness,

1085
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,979
there was no unit,
there was just three people in a mess.

1086
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,732
But now they've got
something in common.

1087
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,943
And you don't want
to make anything worse.

1088
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,153
How could it get any worse
than Laura with lan?

1089
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,115
- Come on, Liz.
- Rob, Rob, Rob.

1090
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,533
Can I ask you a question?

1091
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,993
And you can think about it
if you want to.

1092
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,995
Just what is it?

1093
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,666
Why do you want Laura back so badly?

1094
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,589
Rob, phone.

1095
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,013
Barry, that fucking pricer's busted,
and I'm not the one who broke it.

1096
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,726
- Hello.
- Rob? Bonjour. Bonjour.

1097
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,186
Who is this?

1098
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,774
Is this Charlie?

1099
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:56,280
Hi. I just got back into town.

1100
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:01,535
Wow! Rob Gordon. The Rob Gordon.

1101
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,579
So how are you doing? Huh?

1102
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,706
Does it seem like
millions of years ago?

1103
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,168
Yeah, yeah. Like a billion, right?

1104
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:13,172
So... God, Charlie Nicholson.
How are you?

1105
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,300
I mean, do you have kids
and stuff like everybody else?

1106
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:19,762
No. No, I'm too young, too single.

1107
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,514
I don't know.
Kids are too "time-consuming,"

1108
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,099
I guess, is the expression
I'm looking for.

1109
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,435
I'm not making this up.
This is how she talks,

1110
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,978
as if nobody ever had
a conversation about having kids

1111
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,688
in the history of the world.

1112
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,064
She's incredible.

1113
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:35,194
So, anyway, are you in or out, Rob?

1114
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,197
- I'm sorry?
- Well, you know, I don't know.

1115
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,949
I just find these long-lost
boyfriend calls a little unnerving.

1116
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,620
- There's been a rash of them recently.
- Is that right?

1117
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,874
Yeah. Oh, remember Marco?
I went out with him after you.

1118
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,627
- Kind of.
- Kind of, yeah.

1119
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,004
Well, he called a few months ago.

1120
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,464
I think he was going through
one of those

1121
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,549
what-does-it-all-mean kind of things.

1122
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,636
He wanted to see me
and "rehash the past," as they say.

1123
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,181
Was I up for that? No. No.

1124
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,476
So, I don't know,
do all men go through that?

1125
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,061
I've never heard of it before.

1126
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,148
I'm sorry, Charlie, but what does
"Are you in or out" mean?

1127
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,818
Well, it means,
are we friends or aren't we?

1128
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,403
Because if we are,
that's great, that's great.

1129
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:22,324
But if we're not, I don't really want
to spend time playing catch-up.

1130
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,536
You know what I mean?
I'm just really busy, you know?

1131
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,788
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Of course.

1132
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,333
- So, are you in or out, Rob?
- I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

1133
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:36,004
Oh, yeah? Great. Do you want to come
for a dinner party tomorrow night?

1134
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,472
Can I help you?

1135
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:49,852
Hello, Rob.

1136
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:54,815
Remember me? Ray. Ian.

1137
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,484
I thought maybe we should talk.

1138
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,820
- No.
- Sort things out.

1139
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,656
- What needs sorting out?
- Ten phone calls a night.

1140
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,076
Hanging around outside my house.

1141
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,997
- I've stopped all of that now.
- You were there this morning.

1142
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,712
Obviously, I know
how special Laura is,

1143
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:22,718
And I know how much pain
you must be going through right now.

1144
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:26,179
I would hate it if I lost her.

1145
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:29,433
Guess who?

1146
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:32,477
But I'd like to believe that if she decided

1147
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,314
that she didn't
want to see me anymore,

1148
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,900
that I would respect those wishes.

1149
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,485
You know what I'm saying, G?

1150
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,905
- Yeah.
- Good.

1151
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,032
So, shall we leave it at that, then?

1152
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,534
I've already left it,

1153
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,245
you pathetic rebound fuck!

1154
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:53,832
Now, get your patchouli stink
out of my store!

1155
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,043
Move it, lard-ass!

1156
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,421
Dumb motherfucker.

1157
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,549
So, shall we leave it at that, then?

1158
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:05,802
- No.
- Don't! Don't!

1159
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,930
- He's not worth it!
- Leave town!

1160
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,515
Leave the country! You little bitch!

1161
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,437
'Cause you'll look back at 10
phone calls a night as the golden age!

1162
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,564
Get ready, motherfucker!

1163
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,025
So, shall we leave it at that, then?

1164
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,740
Get him!

1165
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:40,212
- Come on!
- Get him, man!

1166
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,925
Well, think about it, Rob.

1167
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,552
Okay?

1168
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,619
Hey, jelly bean.

1169
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:15,914
Charles.

1170
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,709
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

1171
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,216
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, this is Rob.

1172
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,719
Rob, this is everybody.

1173
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,721
- Hi.
- Hi.

1174
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,180
Come on in. Make yourself at home.

1175
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,515
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1176
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,350
Oh, it's a little warm.
I'll put it in the fridge.

1177
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,602
I think if you get a dog,
you've got to raise it yourself.

1178
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,355
You have to deal with a dog
from day one.

1179
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,606
Of course you do.

1180
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:45,027
You're gonna take care of him,
raise him.

1181
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,571
- Fine, thanks. Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, I would.

1182
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:51,575
I can see now
that I'm doomed to die

1183
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,579
a long, slow suffocating death,
and I try to figure out why.

1184
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:58,832
Of course there's envy.
Why isn't my life like this?

1185
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:03,462
Sure, I want their money
and clothes and jobs and opinions.

1186
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,673
And I'd like to have advice
on jet lag, but that's not it.

1187
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,592
I mean, they're not bad people,
and I'm not a class warrior.

1188
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,052
It's something else.

1189
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,928
- I never did.
- And I was very supportive.

1190
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,221
Then it dawns on me.

1191
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,182
It came down to me to tell him the truth.

1192
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,391
Charlie's awful.

1193
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,226
What was the truth?

1194
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,603
She doesn't listen to anyone.

1195
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,563
She says stupid things,

1196
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,608
and she apparently has
no sense of humor at all,

1197
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,402
and talks shit all night long.

1198
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:30,572
Maybe she's been like this all along.

1199
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,116
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.

1200
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:36,411
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- Call me. Promise to call me.

1201
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,497
Bye.

1202
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,836
How did I manage to edit all this out?

1203
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:49,841
How had I made this girl
the answer to all the world's problems?

1204
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,385
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Rob.

1205
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:00,560
So, Charlie,
why'd you dump me for Marco?

1206
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,439
Fuck! I knew it! I knew it!

1207
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:08,235
I knew it! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1208
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,737
- What?
- You are. You are going through

1209
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,615
one of those
what-does-it-all-mean things.

1210
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,742
I can't believe you, Rob.

1211
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,787
Yes, I am. Very much. Indeed so.

1212
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,705
Oh, God.

1213
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,874
Come on. Answer the question.

1214
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:26,461
Oh, come on, Charlie. Don't hold back.

1215
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,922
You can say whatever you like.

1216
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,299
Why'd you dump me for Marco?

1217
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:37,222
Marco just seemed to be
a bit more glamorous.

1218
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,892
You know? More sure of himself.

1219
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,603
Less hard work.

1220
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:48,692
A little sunnier.

1221
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,735
Sparkier.

1222
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,496
- You put that ad up?
- Yeah.

1223
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:02,873
What can you play?

1224
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:06,793
Nothin'. What kind of stuff are you into?

1225
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,212
The kind of stuff you mentioned.

1226
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,923
But we want to be
more experimental than that.

1227
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:16,178
We want to retain our pop sensibilities,
but, you know, go further out.

1228
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,181
- That sounds great.
- No gigs yet.

1229
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:22,767
We just got together.
Is Tuesday night cool for you?

1230
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,353
We'll just, you know,

1231
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,106
- jam.
- Yeah.

1232
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,609
All right.

1233
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,946
Later.

1234
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,873
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

1235
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,417
You've had that poster up on the wall
for, like, 17,000 years.

1236
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,586
And then some guy comes in
off the street.

1237
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,213
You act like it's no big deal.

1238
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,881
It's just a garage band.
It's nothing special.

1239
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,382
You don't play an instrument.

1240
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,675
I can sing.

1241
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,553
What, you think I'm gonna stick
around here the rest of my life?

1242
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,681
Hey, it's half past a monkey's ass.
Let's go.

1243
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:05,727
I can't meet you guys
at the club tonight.

1244
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,270
Why?

1245
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,274
- Who are you going to see?
- Nobody.

1246
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:15,237
Rob! Lookie, lookie!
Dick, are you getting some?

1247
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,990
Un-fucking-believable!

1248
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,618
Dick's got a hot date!
How did this happen?

1249
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:23,536
What rational explanation
can there possibly be?

1250
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:24,913
What's her name?

1251
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:28,124
- Anaugh.
- Anaugh? Anaugh Conda?

1252
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:31,169
- Anaugh Moss.
- Anaugh Moss?

1253
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:34,297
Is she all green and fuzzy and mossy?

1254
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,883
And you met this bruiser where,
exactly?

1255
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:40,053
The home for the mentally challenged
or the blind or the bus station?

1256
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:44,015
Um, here. She asked me about
the new Green Day album, and...

1257
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,018
Oh, man! Finally! Anaugh.

1258
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,730
That's great, Dick!
Really smoke that ass.

1259
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,732
Listen, Rob,
I can't go to the club, either.

1260
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,110
I gotta get some lyrics down on paper.

1261
01:16:55,194 --> 01:17:00,240
Oh, yeah, me, too.
Well, not lyrics to get down.

1262
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,995
But, um... So, I'll see you tomorrow.

1263
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,541
- Hi, Laura.
- "Top five dream jobs."

1264
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,418
- Hey, that's private.
- "Number one,

1265
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:58,256
"journalist for Rolling Stone
magazine, 1976 to 1979.

1266
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,926
"Get to meet the Clash, Chrissie Hynde,
Sex Pistols, David Byrne.

1267
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,845
"Get tons of free records.

1268
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,388
"Number two,

1269
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:09,809
"Producer, Atlantic Records,
1964 to 1971.

1270
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,604
"Get to meet Aretha,
Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke."

1271
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,022
- More free records.
- "More free records

1272
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,565
"and a shitload of money.

1273
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:19,361
- "Number three, any kind of musician."
- Besides classical or rap.

1274
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,154
"Settle for being one
of the Memphis Horns or something."

1275
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,364
Sure.

1276
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:26,034
"I'm not asking to be Jagger
or Hendrix or Otis Redding.

1277
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,036
"Number four, film director."

1278
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,580
Any kind except German or silent.

1279
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,625
And number five, we have "architect."

1280
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,544
- Yeah.
- Seven years' training.

1281
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,713
I'm not sure I even want
to be an architect.

1282
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:39,923
So you've got a list here

1283
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,550
of five things you'd do if qualifications,

1284
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,053
and time and history
and salary were no object?

1285
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,722
One of them you don't
really want to do anyway.

1286
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,516
Well, I did put it at number five.

1287
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,060
Wouldn't you rather own your own
record store than be an architect?

1288
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,646
- Yeah, I suppose.
- And you wouldn't want to be

1289
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,191
a 16th-century explorer
or the king of France?

1290
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,693
- God, no.
- All right. There you go, then.

1291
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:04,072
Dream job number five,
record store owner.

1292
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,959
I find it interesting that you
keep showing up here, Laura.

1293
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,586
Well, this is the last of it.

1294
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:22,507
Those bags look heavy. Where's lan?

1295
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,259
Or Ray or...

1296
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,470
What is his fucking name anyway?

1297
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,681
- What do you call him? Ian or Ray?
- Ray.

1298
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,225
- I hate lan.
- I hate him, too.

1299
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:36,855
Yeah, I'm sure.

1300
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,857
See ya.

1301
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,193
Goodbye.

1302
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:55,540
Top five thing I miss about Laura.

1303
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,252
One, sense of humor. Very dry,
but it can also be warm and forgiving.

1304
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,964
And she's got one of the best all-time
laughs in the history of all-time laughs.

1305
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,467
She laughs with her entire body.

1306
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,261
Two, she's got character.

1307
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,639
Or at least she had character
before the lan nightmare.

1308
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,433
She's loyal and honest,

1309
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:16,394
and she doesn't even take it out
on people when she's having a bad day.

1310
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,730
That's character.

1311
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,190
Three,

1312
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,238
I miss her smell

1313
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,241
and the way she tastes.

1314
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,411
It's a mystery of human chemistry,
and I don't understand it.

1315
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:38,750
Some people, as far as your senses
are concerned, just feel like home.

1316
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,299
I really dig how she walks around.

1317
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,427
It's like she doesn't care how
she looks or what she projects.

1318
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:54,224
And it's not that she doesn't care,
it's just, she's not affected, I guess.

1319
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,601
And that gives her grace.

1320
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,063
And five, she does this thing in bed
when she can't get to sleep.

1321
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,481
She kind of half-moans

1322
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,858
and then rubs her feet together
an equal number of times.

1323
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,610
It just kills me.

1324
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,114
Believe me, I could do a top five things
about her that drive me crazy,

1325
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,493
but it's just your garden-variety women,
you know, schizo stuff,

1326
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,454
and that's the kind of thinking
that got me here.

1327
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,711
Ah! Damn!

1328
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:27,340
- You maggots!
- Whoa, whoa! Toss it, man!

1329
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,176
- You're pretty when you're angry.
- Shit!

1330
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:36,057
Hey, Rob, Laura called.

1331
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,059
Really?

1332
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,104
What you gonna do

1333
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:45,858
The man's
gone out to get you

1334
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:49,070
How you gonna look

1335
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,073
- What is this?
- It's Vince and Justin.

1336
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,993
- Who's Vince and Justin?
- Those little skate fuckers.

1337
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,370
- No way.
- Way.

1338
01:21:58,664 --> 01:21:59,998
It's really...

1339
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,794
It's really fuckin' good.

1340
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,675
Hey, do you guys know
Vince and Justin,

1341
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:11,968
the guys that come in my store?

1342
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:14,262
- Yeah, they're right over there, man.
- Thanks.

1343
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:18,600
- Quit smoking. I'm telling you...
- Hey! Your tape.

1344
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,603
- It's good.
- I know. We made it.

1345
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,771
- Thank you.
- I mean, it's rough, but, unbelievably,

1346
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,148
it shows promise.

1347
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,026
I'll put out your record.

1348
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,779
Any profits we split down the middle
after I recoup expenses, okay?

1349
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,406
Recoup expenses?

1350
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,326
Man, you're gonna recoup a big,
fat Mercedes, is what you're gonna do.

1351
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,953
- We're not there yet, Justin.
- I'm Vince.

1352
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,414
Whatever.
What's the name of your band?

1353
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,833
- Uh, the Kinky Wizards.
- Nice.

1354
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,877
What's the name of your label?

1355
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,129
Top Five Records.

1356
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,505
What was that?

1357
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,633
You just told them you're gonna
put out a record with them?

1358
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,635
Yeah. So what?
You said yourself those guys are good.

1359
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,136
What are you getting hot about?

1360
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,971
Well, it just seems
that you think it would be wiser

1361
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:59,140
to start a record label
by putting out a record

1362
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
with business-crippling
Nazi youth shoplifters,

1363
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:04,854
than someone you know in your bitter,
jealous heart is a musical visionary.

1364
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,272
What do your songs sound like?

1365
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:08,983
Sex Pistols? Nirvana?
Pop Abrams and the Smurfs?

1366
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,818
You wouldn't be familiar
with our immediate influences.

1367
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,320
- Try me.
- They're mostly German.

1368
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,614
Kraftwerk? Falco? Hasselhoff?

1369
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,116
Hey. You called?

1370
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,663
Fuckin' asshole.

1371
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:25,750
Laura, are you all right?

1372
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,629
My dad, my dad died.

1373
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,226
- What's up?
- Laura's dad died.

1374
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,728
Oh, drag.

1375
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,565
I'm sorry, Rob.

1376
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:55,530
Hey, top five songs about death.

1377
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,658
A Laura's dad tribute list.

1378
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:02,328
Okay? Okay.

1379
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,747
Leader Of The Pack.

1380
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:09,001
The guy fuckin' beefs it
on his motorcycle and dies, right?

1381
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,170
Dead Man's Curve. Jan and Dean.

1382
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,922
Do you know that right after
they recorded that song,

1383
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,590
Jan himself crashed his...

1384
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,592
- It was Dean, you fuckin' idiot.
- It was Jan.

1385
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,137
- It was a long time after the...
- Okay, whatever.

1386
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,306
Tell Laura I Love Her.
That would bring the house down.

1387
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,642
Laura's mom could sing it.

1388
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,978
- You know what I'd want?
- Huh?

1389
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,522
One Step Beyond by Madness.

1390
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,442
No, no, no, no, no.
When are you going home?

1391
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:35,778
In a minute, when I get it together.

1392
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:38,948
And You Can't
Always Get What You Want.

1393
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,826
Immediate disqualification because
of its involvement with The Big Chill.

1394
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,579
Oh, God, you're right.

1395
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,081
Um, Mom wants you to
come to the funeral.

1396
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:51,669
- Oh. Me?
- Yes. My dad really liked you.

1397
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:55,089
And Mom never told him we'd split,
because he wasn't up to it.

1398
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,759
Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald.
Gordon Lightfoot.

1399
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,802
Bastard. That's so good,
that should have been mine.

1400
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:02,597
Do you want me there?

1401
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,600
I don't care, as long as you don't
expect me to hold your hand.

1402
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,019
- Is Ray going?
- No!

1403
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,066
The night Laura's daddy died

1404
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:17,528
Sha-na-na, na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na

1405
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,572
Brother, what a night it really was

1406
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:22,074
Mother, what a night it really...
Angina's tough

1407
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,452
Glory be

1408
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,579
Brother, what a night it really was

1409
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,664
Brother, what a night
Angina's tough

1410
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,420
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

1411
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:38,299
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

1412
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:41,302
- on Earth as it is in heaven.
- Songs at my funeral,

1413
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:45,431
Many Rivers To Cross by Jimmy Cliff,
Angel by Aretha Franklin,

1414
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:47,141
and I've always had this fantasy

1415
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,936
that some beautiful,
tearful woman will insist on

1416
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,606
You're The Best Thing That Ever
Happened To Me by Gladys Knight.

1417
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:57,401
- But who would that woman be?
- Amen.

1418
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,686
- Hey, Jo.
- Hi, Liz.

1419
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,729
Hey. How are you doing?

1420
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:37,149
I'm all right, I suppose.
Mom's not too bad.

1421
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,610
But Laura, I don't know.

1422
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:44,198
Yeah, well, she's had a rough time
of it already, without this.

1423
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:47,994
It's just so hard when you put all
of your efforts into one area of your life

1424
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,037
and it doesn't work out.

1425
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,623
Don't mind me, really.

1426
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,960
Just pretend like you're talking
about someone else. It's okay.

1427
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:59,463
Well, in fact,
we are talking about someone else.

1428
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,382
We're talking about Laura.

1429
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,301
- Oh.
- Oh?

1430
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:06,345
Don't fuckin' say "oh"
like that to me, Liz.

1431
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,765
I'm really sorry, Jo.
Look, I can either stick up for myself,

1432
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,935
or I can believe everything you say
about me and end up hating myself.

1433
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,354
But that's not much of a life, is it? Huh?

1434
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,274
Do you think this is really the time
to be talking about...

1435
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,444
Just because it's never the time, Liz?
I can't go on apologizing my whole life.

1436
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:24,238
I think just the once would do!

1437
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:32,204
- I'm very sorry, Laura.
- Thanks for coming.

1438
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:35,082
I'm so sorry, Laura.

1439
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,210
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1440
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:42,924
Laura, I'm sorry.

1441
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:04,320
Most ofthe time

1442
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:07,949
I'm clear-focused all around

1443
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,160
Most of the time

1444
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,497
I can keep both feet
on the ground

1445
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,834
I can follow the path

1446
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:22,338
I can read the signs

1447
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:26,884
Stay right with it
When the road unwinds

1448
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:30,346
I can handle whatever

1449
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,683
I stumble upon

1450
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:37,687
I don't even notice

1451
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,230
She's gone

1452
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,524
I can see now
I never really committed to Laura.

1453
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:45,653
I always had one foot out the door

1454
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,948
and that prevented me
from doing a lot of things.

1455
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:52,284
Like thinking about my future.

1456
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:56,038
I guess it made more sense
to commit to nothing.

1457
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,082
Keep my options open.

1458
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,837
And that's suicide.

1459
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,800
By tiny, tiny increments.

1460
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:11,429
I can make it all match up

1461
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,223
I can hold my own

1462
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:17,351
I can deal with the situation

1463
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:19,645
Right down to the bone

1464
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:23,190
I can survive

1465
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,776
And I can endure

1466
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,613
And I don't even think

1467
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,616
About her

1468
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,994
Most of the time

1469
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:41,208
Are you gonna lie
in that flower bed all night?

1470
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,882
No.

1471
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:50,676
- You're soaking.
- Yeah.

1472
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:52,553
You're also an idiot.

1473
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,725
Look, Laura, I'm really sorry.

1474
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,061
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1475
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,645
Why don't you just get back,

1476
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,481
and I'm just gonna
wait here for the bus.

1477
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,899
No, I don't want to be there.

1478
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:07,693
When I saw you leave,
I used it as an excuse to get out.

1479
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,281
Is there anything I can do?

1480
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,658
- Come on.
- Where?

1481
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:17,369
I'll show you. Let's go.

1482
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,914
Right.

1483
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:36,555
Dad used to bring us here
when we were kids.

1484
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:43,020
Listen, Rob,
would you have sex with me?

1485
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:49,360
'Cause I want to feel
something else than this.

1486
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:53,781
It's either that, or I go home
and put my hand in the fire.

1487
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:59,495
Unless you want to stub
cigarettes out on my arm.

1488
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,958
No. I only have a few left.
I've been saving them for later.

1489
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:08,087
Right. It'll have to be sex, then.

1490
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,339
Right. Right.

1491
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:15,803
I knew there was a reason
I wore a skirt today.

1492
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:19,932
- Just stay there.
- Okay.

1493
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,533
- Hi.
- Hi.

1494
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:42,163
It doesn't seem so long ago
that I looked at you from here.

1495
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:21,785
Hey, go be with your mom.

1496
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,080
I'm too tired.

1497
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,459
I'm too tired not to be with you.

1498
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:37,218
So if you had a bit more energy,
we'd stay split up?

1499
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,762
But things being as they are,
you being wiped out and all,

1500
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,805
you wanna get back together?

1501
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,892
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

1502
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,148
Mmm. What about lan?

1503
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,486
Well, Ray's a disaster.

1504
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:58,697
Look.

1505
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:02,576
I know it's not very romantic, Rob.

1506
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:05,412
But there will be romance again
at some stage, I'm sure.

1507
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,250
- I just...
- So, that's it?

1508
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:13,295
Well, you've made it clear
you want me back, so...

1509
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:17,091
Look, um, we can talk about it later
if you want to.

1510
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,219
Right now, I just...

1511
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:26,016
Right now, I just
want to go home with you.

1512
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:29,770
Okay.

1513
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,856
So, yeah.

1514
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:51,208
And so we got back together,
and it was great.

1515
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:54,211
She moved all her stuff back in,
all at once.

1516
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,505
When did you decide
to get back with me, exactly?

1517
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,632
I'm not telling you.

1518
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:02,219
See, that's not a nice way to play.

1519
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,556
We went out to dinner every night.

1520
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,808
What else?

1521
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:11,395
We stayed in
and made love all the time.

1522
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:14,440
We talked about the future.

1523
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:17,568
Important stuff. Issues.

1524
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:20,487
How can you like Art Garfunkel
and Marvin Gaye?

1525
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:23,490
That's like saying you support
the Israelis and the Palestinians.

1526
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:25,826
No, it's not like saying
that at all, actually, Rob.

1527
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,995
Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel
make pop records.

1528
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,372
Made. Made. Marvin Gaye's dead.
His father shot him.

1529
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:35,836
You could say it was everything
I ever wanted, really.

1530
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,963
- Marvin Gaye! Let's Get It On.
- I know.

1531
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:39,256
That's our song!

1532
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:41,175
Marvin Gaye is responsible
for our entire relationship.

1533
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:43,594
Oh, is that so?
I'd like a word with him, then.

1534
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:47,014
It was everything I ever wanted.

1535
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:50,100
Except, for some fucking reason,

1536
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:54,396
this...

1537
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:05,657
Excuse me. Is this Stereolab?

1538
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:07,868
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1539
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,704
I haven't heard this one. It's really good.

1540
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:12,831
Yeah, I know.

1541
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,917
Are you Bob?

1542
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,044
Rob.

1543
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:20,047
Oh, right. Yeah, Rob.
You used to deejay.

1544
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,217
I used to go to the Double Door
to hear you spin.

1545
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:27,179
- You were unbelievable.
- Really? Well...

1546
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:31,100
- I'm Caroline.
- Hi.

1547
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:32,559
What do you do?

1548
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,603
I work for The Reader.
I write a music column.

1549
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:38,273
You're Caroline Fortis?
I read your column.

1550
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,650
- It's great.
- Thanks.

1551
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:40,901
You really know
what you're talking about.

1552
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,070
- Rob, phone.
- Can you take a message?

1553
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,239
It's your girlfriend.

1554
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,827
Excuse me.

1555
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:57,376
Hey.

1556
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:13,475
Hey, what the fuck is this?

1557
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:17,146
- Talk to your woman.
- It was her idea.

1558
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,067
Laura!

1559
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,946
"Dance music for old people"?

1560
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:28,949
It's an idea I had
when I was with, um, lan

1561
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,492
and I thought it was such a good one,

1562
01:36:30,577 --> 01:36:33,036
that I was really annoyed
we weren't together anymore.

1563
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:35,205
- It may be why I came back.
- A record release party?

1564
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,207
What if I was doing something
that can't be canceled?

1565
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:39,126
What are you ever doing
that can't be canceled?

1566
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,545
That's not the point!
The single cannot be done.

1567
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,839
- There's a million things!
- It'll be done.

1568
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:46,300
Oh, guess what?
Barry said his band will play a set.

1569
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,635
Barry is playing at this thing?

1570
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,223
Fucking, what are you...
Are you insane?

1571
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:58,353
Barry, I'll give you 10%
of the door if you don't play.

1572
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,522
Rob, we're getting that anyway.

1573
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:03,984
- Twenty, 20%.
- No! Come on, Rob. We need the gig.

1574
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,819
110%.

1575
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:08,780
That's how much it means
to me not to hear you play.

1576
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:12,326
- Rob, we're called Sonic Death Monkey.
- Sonic Death Monkey?

1577
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,120
And if Laura and her bourgeois
lawyer friends can't handle it,

1578
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:16,997
fuck them. Let 'em riot.

1579
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,666
We're Sonic fucking Death Monkey.

1580
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:23,337
Let me get this straight.
We made the CD with you.

1581
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:25,297
Now your friends and your girlfriend

1582
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,759
are throwing some
kind of celebration party

1583
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,303
and you're asking us
not to come to the party?

1584
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:33,555
Exactly.

1585
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,975
I don't know, dude.
That just seems kind of stupid.

1586
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:41,647
It's just the whole thing
is just blown way out of proportion.

1587
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,858
It's just a three-song CD. It's a single.

1588
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:47,027
It's not a big deal.

1589
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:51,573
It's just that you're making something.

1590
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:55,118
You, the critic,
the professional appreciator,

1591
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,412
put something new into the world.

1592
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,706
The second one of those things
gets sold to someone,

1593
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,667
you're officially a part of it.

1594
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:04,127
Congratulations, Rob.

1595
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,009
You know, I guess I think I've always
been a professional critic,

1596
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:14,846
you know, or some sort of
professional appreciator or something.

1597
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,516
And I just wanted to, you know,
do something new,

1598
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,309
put something new out into the world,

1599
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,145
kind of really put my money
where my mouth is.

1600
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,856
Yeah. Wow. You know,
I would love to hear them.

1601
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,900
Why don't I send it over
to you when it's done?

1602
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:28,485
Really?

1603
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,947
- I will look forward to that.
- I will look forward to sending it.

1604
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:34,199
You know, we should
get back to the interview.

1605
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:35,742
Yeah, let's do that.

1606
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:40,831
Okay. What are your all-time
top five favorite records?

1607
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,418
In the club or at home?

1608
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:48,797
Listen. I'll tell you what.
Why don't I just make you a tape?

1609
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:56,888
Now, the making of a good
compilation tape is a very subtle art.

1610
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,016
Many dos and don'ts.

1611
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,519
First of all, you're using someone else's
poetry to express how you feel.

1612
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:04,896
This is a delicate thing.

1613
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:08,025
So, for this one, I'm thinking...

1614
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,820
I'm thinking...

1615
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,490
When is this gonna stop?

1616
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:17,492
When's what gonna stop?

1617
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:19,536
Uh, nothing.

1618
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,459
Who's the tape for?

1619
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:30,380
Just some girl who interviewed me
for The Reader.

1620
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:43,477
So what am I gonna do now?
Just keep jumping

1621
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,272
from rock to rock for the rest of my life
until there aren't any rocks left?

1622
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,566
Should I bolt every time
I get that feeling in my gut

1623
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,068
when I meet someone new?

1624
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,904
I've been thinking with my gut
since I was 14 years old,

1625
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,155
and, frankly speaking,

1626
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:58,575
I've come to the conclusion
that my guts have shit for brains.

1627
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:10,170
Hi. Drinking lunch on a school day.

1628
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,839
That's a nice surprise.

1629
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,596
Are you nervous about tomorrow night?

1630
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,765
Not really, no.

1631
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:28,689
Well, are you gonna talk to me,
or shall I get my paper out?

1632
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,148
- No, I'm gonna talk to you.
- Great.

1633
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:32,442
What are you gonna talk to me about?

1634
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:36,363
Um, I'm gonna talk to you
about whether or not

1635
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,409
you want to get married to me.

1636
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,706
- I'm serious.
- Yes, I know.

1637
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:48,208
Well, thanks a fucking bunch.

1638
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:51,378
I'm sorry. Two days ago,
you were making tapes

1639
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,547
- for that girl from The Reader.
- Yeah.

1640
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,883
Well, forgive me if I don't think
of you as the world's safest bet.

1641
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,344
Would you marry me if I was?

1642
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:02,055
- What brought all this on?
- I don't know.

1643
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,974
I'm just sick of thinking
about it all the time.

1644
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,601
- About what?
- This stuff.

1645
01:41:06,686 --> 01:41:10,564
Love and settling down
and marriage, you know?

1646
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,566
I want to think about something else.

1647
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:15,902
I changed my mind.

1648
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:18,405
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

1649
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,532
- I do. I will.
- Just shut up, please.

1650
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:23,577
I'm trying to explain, okay?

1651
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:26,538
That other girl,
or other women, whatever...

1652
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:30,834
I mean, I was thinking
that they're just fantasies.

1653
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:35,255
You know?
And they always seem really great

1654
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,592
because there's never any problems.

1655
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,094
And if there are, they're cute problems,

1656
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:44,264
like, you know, we bought each other
the same Christmas present,

1657
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,892
or she wants to go see a movie
that I've already seen, you know?

1658
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,436
And then I come home,
and you and I have real problems,

1659
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,856
and you don't even want to see
the movie I want to see, period.

1660
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,734
- There's no lingerie and...
- I have lingerie.

1661
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,027
Yes, you do. You have great lingerie.

1662
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:58,987
But you also have the cotton underwear

1663
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,449
that's been washed a thousand times,
and it's hanging on the thing and...

1664
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:05,118
And they have it, too.

1665
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,245
It's just I don't have to see it
because it's not in the fantasy.

1666
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,331
Do you understand?

1667
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:12,167
I'm tired of the fantasy

1668
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,878
because it doesn't really exist.

1669
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:18,799
And there are never really
any surprises, and it never really...

1670
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:21,259
- Delivers?
- Delivers.

1671
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:24,888
Right. And I'm tired of it.

1672
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:30,060
I'm tired of everything else,
for that matter.

1673
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,272
But I don't ever seem to get tired of you.

1674
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:36,399
So...

1675
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,652
I think I know what you mean.

1676
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:43,365
But were you really
expecting me to say yes?

1677
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:48,620
I don't know.
I didn't think about it, really.

1678
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:53,083
I thought asking
was the important part.

1679
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:59,214
Well, you've asked. Thank you.

1680
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:23,029
Uh, thanks for coming out here tonight.

1681
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:26,324
That was just a little bit
of I Sold My Mom's Wheelchair,

1682
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:28,577
the title track
from the album of same name,

1683
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:31,580
the record we're having
this record release party for.

1684
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:35,375
The two burgeoning criminals behind
this opus are standing by the bar.

1685
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,545
They're underage,
and we'll lose our liquor license.

1686
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:46,761
But we'll get to them in a moment.

1687
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:50,265
First, I have to introduce a band,
so please don't leave

1688
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:54,269
until after they finish
and we play the record.

1689
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:57,647
Right now,
it's my great, great pleasure

1690
01:43:57,732 --> 01:44:01,151
to introduce Sonic Death Monkey.

1691
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:12,245
I'm an idiot. I should've played
the whole album first.

1692
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,663
These people are gonna
burn the place down.

1693
01:44:13,748 --> 01:44:15,123
No, no, it's gonna be fine.

1694
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:17,584
These people are ready for anything.

1695
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:19,753
- It's gonna be fine. Watch.
- Thank you.

1696
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:24,215
You're so kind. Rob, thank you
for the enthusiastic intro,

1697
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,052
but we're no longer
called Sonic Death Monkey.

1698
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:31,056
We're on the verge of being called
Kathleen Turner Overdrive.

1699
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,808
However, this evening
we will be Barry Jive

1700
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,937
and the Uptown Five.

1701
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:45,403
I been really tryin', baby

1702
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:48,615
To hold on to this feeling

1703
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:51,743
For so long

1704
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:54,287
And if you feel

1705
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:57,791
Like I feel, sugar, come on

1706
01:44:57,875 --> 01:45:01,544
Oh, come on, oh

1707
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:04,381
Let's get it on

1708
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:10,011
Let's get it on

1709
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:12,097
Let's love, sugar

1710
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,768
Let's get it on

1711
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:19,187
Sugar

1712
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:22,232
Let's get it on

1713
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:25,318
Whoo-ooh-ooh

1714
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:30,824
We are all sensitive people

1715
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:34,411
With so much to give

1716
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:37,622
Understanding, sugar

1717
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:43,003
Since we got to be

1718
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,381
Let's live

1719
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:49,592
I love you

1720
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:53,680
There's nothing wrong

1721
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,182
With me loving you

1722
01:45:56,267 --> 01:46:00,186
Sha-na-na-na-na

1723
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,732
And giving yourself to me

1724
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:06,776
Could never be wrong

1725
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,196
If the love is true
Oh, baby

1726
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:18,538
Don't you know
how sweet and wonderful

1727
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:22,459
The making of a great compilation tape,

1728
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:23,918
like breaking up, is hard to do

1729
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:26,379
and takes ages
longer than it might seem.

1730
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:29,299
You gotta kick it off
with a killer to grab attention.

1731
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,469
Then you gotta take it up a notch,
but you don't want to blow your wad.

1732
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:36,473
So then you gotta cool it off a notch.
There are a lot of rules.

1733
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,476
Anyway, I've started to make a tape,

1734
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:43,021
in my head, for Laura.

1735
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:45,065
Full of stuff she'd like.

1736
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:47,817
Full of stuff that'd make her happy.

1737
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,822
For the first time,
I can see how that's done.

1738
01:46:57,787 --> 01:47:01,915
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1739
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:05,335
It will be forever

1740
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:08,671
I believe
when I fall in love

1741
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:12,884
This time it will be forever

1742
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:17,055
Without despair

1743
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,808
We will share

1744
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:22,560
And the joys of caring

1745
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:27,565
Will not be replaced

1746
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:32,153
What has been

1747
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:35,406
Must never end

1748
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:38,952
And with the strength
we have

1749
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:43,623
Won't be erased

1750
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,877
When the truth of love
all planned and firm

1751
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:51,589
They won't be hard to find

1752
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:55,802
And the words of love
I speak to you

1753
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,514
Will echo in my mind

1754
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:06,187
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1755
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,565
It will be forever

1756
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:13,987
I believe when I fall
in love this time

1757
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:17,031
It will be forever

1758
01:48:18,576 --> 01:48:20,785
- Ever
- Ever

1759
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:27,709
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1760
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:30,503
It will be forever

1761
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:35,508
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1762
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:38,636
It will be forever

1763
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:43,600
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1764
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:47,437
It will be forever

1765
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:51,357
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1766
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:55,069
It will be forever

1767
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:58,865
I believe when I fall
in love with you

1768
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:02,410
It will be forever

1769
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:05,747
- God answered
- I believe when I fall in love

1770
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:09,709
- My prayer
- With you it will be forever

1771
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:15,215
- God answered my prayer
- I believe when I fall in love with you

1772
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,926
- It will be forever
- Oh, baby

1773
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,984
ljust got out
my little red book

1774
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:37,528
The minute that
you said good-bye

1775
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:42,158
I thumbed right through
my little red book

1776
01:49:42,243 --> 01:49:44,535
I wasn't gonna sit and cry

1777
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:48,122
And I went from "A" to "Z"

1778
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:52,126
I took out every
pretty girl in town

1779
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:56,339
They danced with me
and as I held them

1780
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:58,758
All I did
was talk about you

1781
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:01,177
Hear your name
and I'd start to cry

1782
01:50:01,262 --> 01:50:05,098
There's just
no getting over you

1783
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:08,101
Oh, no

1784
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,728
There ain't no girl
in my little red book

1785
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:13,856
Who could ever
replace your charms

1786
01:50:15,693 --> 01:50:17,944
And each girl
in my little red book

1787
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,571
Knows you're the one
I'm thinking of

1788
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:23,908
Oh, won't you please
come back

1789
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:27,829
Without your precious love
I can't go on

1790
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:32,333
Where can love be
I need you so much

1791
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:34,711
All I did was talk
talk about you

1792
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:37,046
Hear your name
and I'd start to cry

1793
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:40,883
There's just
no getting over you

1794
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:43,761
Oh, no

1795
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:52,687
Oh, won't you please
come back

1796
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:56,816
Without your precious love
I can't go on

1797
01:50:56,900 --> 01:51:00,987
It's haunting me
I need you so much

1798
01:51:01,071 --> 01:51:03,448
All I did was talk
talk about you

1799
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:05,658
Hear your name
and I'd start to cry

1800
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:10,163
There's just
no getting over you

1801
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:12,790
All I did was talk
talk about you

1802
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,168
Hear your name
and I'd start to cry

1803
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:19,005
There's just
no getting over you

1804
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:21,924
Oh, no
