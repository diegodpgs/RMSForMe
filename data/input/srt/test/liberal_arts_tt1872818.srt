1
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,285
You know, high school to college,

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,578
it can be a big transition,

3
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,580
especially if you're not from the city,

4
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,250
so... so we try to help
out with that transition

5
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,751
in a number of ways.

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,419
That's a real accomplishment.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,754
Congratulations.

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,923
I mean, you're not in yet, but...

9
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,383
no, things are looking pretty good.

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,635
We do an all-campus
picnic, which is a nice way

11
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,806
for the incoming
students to acclimate themselves

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,349
to the college.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,269
For me, the most exciting thing
about this place is the classes.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,937
So you don't want to go to college?

15
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,357
You know, I'm not up to
date on the course catalog.

16
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,611
One of the great things about
this school is, you know,

17
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,030
you have a campus called New York City.

18
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,949
Greatest city in the world, they say.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,285
I thought your essay was...
was interesting.

20
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,870
A spell-check might be
nice on these essays.

21
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,455
Planning on taking your boards again?

22
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,873
Love those extracurriculars.

23
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,459
Have you heard about the meal plan?

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,877
Fantastic.

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,462
Where do you see things going, you know,

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,590
after... after college?

27
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,778

Mine.

00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,417
You can have it if you want, though.

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,463
Is that a new shirt?

40
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,507
Yeah, it is.

41
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,758
Do you like it?

42
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,176
Don't ask me that.

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,428
Why?

44
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,846
Because it's not my job

45
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,306
to make you feel good
about yourself anymore.

Anything else?

52
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,867
Oh, no, that's it.

53
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,749
That's a nice shirt.

Hello?

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,580
Jesse Fisher?

60
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,664
Yeah?

61
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,999
It's your favorite Communist.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,375
Professor Peter Hoberg?

63
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,211
Screw you. I'm not a Communist.

64
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,337
How you doing?

65
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,838
Oh, you know.

66
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,883
Listen, I don't want to take
up too much of your time,

67
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,176
but here's why I'm calling.

68
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,011
Ever since I announced that
I was packing it in,

69
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,222
it's funny, but this whole
place has finally decided

70
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,890
that they don't really hate me after all.

71
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,601
Now, I know Ohio is not
as glamorous as New York,

72
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,937
but they're throwing me
a retirement dinner thing

73
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,230
at the end of the month,

74
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,565
and they asked me to
invite any former students

75
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,859
that might want to lie and
say some nice things about me.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,570
And since you're one of the
great liars that I know...

77
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,738
When is it?

78
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,864
Weekend of the 25th.

79
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,616
You know, check your schedule.

80
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,618
Okay.

81
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,412
Checking now.

82
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:37,169
Looks like I'd have to
shift some things around, but yeah.

83
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,338
I'll be there.

84
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,582
Hi.

85
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,043
Look at this.

86
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,920
How are you?

87
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,091
- Jesse.
- Yeah, hi.

88
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,718
Hi, I'm David. This is Susan.

89
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,844
- Hi.
- Hey.

90
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,304
Peter warned you that we'd be here?

91
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,305
He did. He did, yeah.

92
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,725
We're making him take
care of us while we're here.

93
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,976
How was your drive?

94
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,686
It was good, yeah. Pleasant, actually.

95
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,396
Peter, Jesse's here!

96
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,606
So it's good to be back?

97
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,857
Yeah. Yeah, it's weird.

98
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,983
I drove up the hill.

99
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,401
I suddenly felt like I was seeing

100
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,736
an ex-girlfriend or something.

101
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,030
- The one that got away.
- Exactly.

102
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,782
Zibby loves it here so much,

103
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,158
she gets sad to come home on breaks.

104
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,242
Zibby?

105
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,661
Sorry. Elizabeth, our daughter.

106
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,787
She's a sophomore.

107
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,871
She's in the improv group.

108
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,331
We came up to see one of her shows.

109
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,958
- How was it?
- Hilarious.

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,460
Filthy but hilarious.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
So how do you guys know Peter?

112
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,713
He was my camp counselor.

113
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,215
No way.

114
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,426
He made us sing pro-union
songs around the campfire.

115
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>♪ You must stand up for your brother ♪</i>

116
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,014
<i>♪ So you won't die for the man ♪</i>

117
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,725
<i>♪ Stand up for your
brother so you won't die for... ♪</i>

118
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,519
He never writes. He never calls.

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,270
Oh, hey.

120
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,022
Let me look at you.

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,524
Not bad.

122
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,234
Who's hungry?

123
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,944
- I'm hungry.
- Okay, let's go.

124
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,362
We've got reservations.

125
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,324
Oh, man, 37 years.

126
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,701
Can you believe it?

127
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,163
Native New Yorker spends
37 years in a county

128
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,499
where the tallest building's nine stories.

129
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,377
Oh, my.

130
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,212
How are you feeling about it all?

131
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,338
- The retirement?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,132
Oh, I don't know.

133
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,009
Another year of faculty meetings,

134
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,220
I'd throw myself off
that nine-story building.

135
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,433
So how's the admissions game, buddy?

136
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,227
"How's the admissions game, buddy?"

137
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,022
Is that Professor Fairfield?

138
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,064
Yeah.

139
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,066
She looks fantastic!

140
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,443
Professor!

141
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,361
What is she like? Is she cool?

142
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,946
She's definitely not warm.

143
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,116
I loved her British Romantic lit class.

144
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,452
She was, like, the best teacher I had here.

145
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,663
She was, like, the second
best teacher I had here.

146
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,250
Unbelievable.

147
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,960
You are unbelievable.

148
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,170
What?

149
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,264
Tell her how you feel.

150
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,766
I will.

151
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,478
Jesse, this is my daughter, Zibby.

152
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,562
Hey.

153
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,439
Hi. Hello.

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,899
Peter, should we follow you?

155
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,650
If you think that's wise.

156
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,240
And he's like, "I had it
up to here with America"

157
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,409
and its repressive,
regressive, fascist", whatever.

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,952
I sound like that? That's how I sound?

159
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,120
You do. You sound like that.

160
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,497
And he gets up in front of the class.

161
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,290
He says, "I just... I
couldn't take it anymore",

162
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,294
so I picked up my
life, and I moved to France".

163
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,463
This is being ludicrously
misreported, by the way.

164
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,798
So I raised my hand.

165
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,633
I said, "Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Peter."

166
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,427
You're telling us you
got so angry at this country

167
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,305
"that you moved to France?"

168
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,141
And Peter says, "Yeah."

169
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,267
Well, I had a Fulbright".

170
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,312
Yeah, well, yeah, if I told you

171
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,939
what this putz was like when he was here,

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,148
he'd run out of the room crying.

173
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,399
That's probably true.

174
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,318
Well, what were you like
when you were here?

175
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,530
I was very handsome, wasn't I?

176
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,864
Am I remembering that correctly?

177
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,116
No, I don't remember that.

178
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,326
But what I do remember
is you being a real jerk

179
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,328
to your parents on graduation weekend.

180
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,704
He didn't want to leave.

181
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,956
It's true.

182
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,834
And I blamed my parents,
weirdly, all four of them.

183
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,794
Like it was their fault college was ending.

184
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,920
Don't do that to us.

185
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,089
- No, I won't.
- She says that now.

186
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,467
So your parents told me
you're in the improv group?

187
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,635
Yeah.

188
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,719
How's that?

189
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,471
It's the best. I love it.

190
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,764
What do you love about it?

191
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:45,352
I think I love how terrifying it is

192
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,689
and how you have to say
"yes" to everything.

193
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,691
Sorry, what does that mean?

194
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,317
It's, like, the only rule of improv.

195
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,610
You can never say "no".

196
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,697
You have to say "yes"
and then add something.

197
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,241
Like... like, look.

198
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,785
Okay, Mom, you and I

199
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,121
have been wandering in the desert for days,

200
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,039
and we're about to die, okay?

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,249
Okay.

202
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,254
Okay, and I say, "Hand me that lemonade".

203
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,050
So hand me that lemonade.

204
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,097
Jesus, Susan, hand her
the goddamn lemonade.

205
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,223
Never mind.

206
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,059
Jesse, hand me that lemonade.

207
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,979
Thank you.

208
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,567
Sweet, just the way I like it.

209
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,902
I nailed this.

210
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,240
It doesn't make sense.

211
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,575
We're in the desert.

212
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,036
I mean, where would we get lemonade?

213
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,207
It's great seeing you guys.

214
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
So what was your major?

215
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,044
I was English with a minor in history,

216
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,962
just to make sure I was fully unemployable.

217
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,422
- Right.
- What about you?

218
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,506
Drama.

219
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,925
I mean, not officially yet,

220
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,010
'cause my dad's not
totally thrilled with the idea,

221
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,763
so maybe also art history?

222
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,932
I'm just happy you go
to class occasionally.

223
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,017
I thought maybe you
just improvised all day long.

224
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,435
Nope.

225
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,811
I mean, I do, I guess.

226
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,230
Have you ever thought about that?

227
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,397
About what?

228
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,025
How everything in life is
basically improvised?

229
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,318
There's no script.

230
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,363
We're just making this up as we go.

231
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,697
That's true.

232
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,823
So yeah.

233
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,243
Well, improv is deep, man.

234
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,702
Well, we're about to head out.

235
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,788
- Pleasure to meet you, Jesse.
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

236
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,081
Take care. Bye.

237
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,666
So I'll... I'll see you around, I guess.

238
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,751
- Yeah, yeah, see you around.
- Okay.

239
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,877
It was nice to meet you.

240
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,462
Yeah, you too.

241
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,714
- See you later.
- Okay, bye.

242
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,262
Enjoy college.

243
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,604
You wearing a tie tonight?

244
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,694
What can you say, really?

245
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,573
People get up and say all
this great stuff about you.

246
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,992
You know, I'm thinking,

247
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,827
"Who in the hell are they talking about?"

248
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,795
It's just, where does the time go?

249
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,005
This seems impossible.

250
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,423
37 years.

251
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,758
37.

252
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,345
There comes a time in a man's life

253
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,639
when it hurts to do the math.

254
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,191
You know, I worry that
I've been here so long

255
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,029
that I'll be lousy being anyplace else.

256
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,701
Oh, well, I guess I'll
find out very shortly.

257
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,799
Hey, thanks for the chicken.

258
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,053
It was a little cold, but still I...

259
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,974
Think nice thoughts about me when I'm gone,

260
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,352
if you can.

261
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,027
No, they did it at Macalester.

262
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,403
I really think it could work here.

263
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,821
Well, it sounds great.

264
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,324
I tell you, let's talk about it on Monday.

265
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,493
Oh, sure.

266
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,786
Night, Jesse.

267
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,412
Yeah, good night.

268
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,916
It's a good idea, though.

269
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,544
It's a terrible idea.

270
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,008
Oh, what a disaster.

271
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,511
What... no, it was nice.

272
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,013
You're not half the liar you used to be.

273
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,936
You know, it really means a lot to me

274
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,145
that you came out for this.

275
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,438
How could I miss it?

276
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,148
You're the second best teacher I had here.

277
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,359
I'm serious.

278
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,448
I'm gonna take off.

279
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,616
Well, I'll come with you.

280
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,451
Oh, no, no, no, you stay.

281
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,578
I want to be alone for a bit.

282
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,232
I feel you, man.

283
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,485
A lot of information in trees.

284
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,325
How's your night going?

285
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,410
Fine.

286
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,663
Is your name...

287
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,790
Ethan?

288
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,334
No. Why?

289
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,836
You look like an Ethan to me.

290
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,671
My name's not Ethan.

291
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,840
How cool would that have
been if that was your name

292
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,383
and I just, like...

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,011
Knew it?

294
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,721
Are you a student here?

295
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,724
No, but thank you for thinking that.

296
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,808
You?

297
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,059
Nah, man.

298
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,187
I'm just here visiting a buddy of mine.

299
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,732
But it's not a bad place to
kill a little time?

300
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,567
I'm Nat.

301
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,694
I'm Jesse.

302
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,030
Do you hear that music, Ethan?

303
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,657
It sounds like a celebration.

304
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,910
I say we do a little sherlocking,

305
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,120
find out where it's coming
from and what's going on.

306
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,539
- No...
- Don't say no.

307
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,000
Fortune never smiles on those who say no.

308
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,050
<i>♪ Everybody get on the floor ♪</i>

309
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,219
<i>♪ Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh ♪</i>

310
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,721
<i>♪ Everybody get on the floor ♪</i>

311
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,681
<i>♪ Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh ♪</i>

312
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,183
<i>♪ Everybody get... ♪</i>

313
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,436
I would get you a beer,
but alcohol's for suckers, man.

314
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,812
Yeah.

315
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,898
Listen, Nat, this isn't
really my scene anymore.

316
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm gonna...

317
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,485
Give yourself five minutes
to adapt, my brother.

318
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,904
Change is never easy.

319
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,082
Tell me this.

320
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,252
What are your thoughts on crop circles?

321
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,337
I don't have any.

322
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,132
There's some seriously
weird shit going on, bro.

323
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,134
You think it's just a
bunch of drunk English guys

324
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,469
with planks and rope?

325
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,304
You're a fool.

326
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,224
Spend some time with those patterns.

327
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,101
You can feel it.

328
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,271
Something's trying to communicate with us.

329
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,692
It should be on the front
page of every paper every day.

330
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,194
Okay. Thanks.

331
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,320
Hey!

332
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,114
I thought that was you.

333
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,283
- Hi.
- How'd you end up here?

334
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,534
He made a friend.

335
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,786
Yeah, yeah, I... yeah.

336
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,204
Look at you.

337
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,790
You're, like, back in college.

338
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,874
Whee!

339
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,167
How does it feel?

340
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,670
Oh, this is Vanessa.

341
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,213
- Hey.
- Hi.

342
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,464
- I'm Nat.
- Hey.

343
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,507
Jesse's an alum.

344
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,800
We had brunch this morning.

345
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,969
I think my mom has a little crush on him.

346
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,178
You went here?

347
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,221
I did, yeah.

348
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,639
When'd you graduate?

349
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,517
Oh, man, it was the '90s.

350
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,646
That was when we were born.

351
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,773
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,483
I'm old.

353
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,319
But you look good.

354
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,656
And you're overdressed.

355
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>♪ Hotter, sweeter, taller... ♪</i>

356
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,048
That's better.

357
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,008
<i>♪ Hotter, sweeter ♪</i>

358
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,427
Why do I like this guy so much?

359
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,512
Because he's likable.

360
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,807
Hey, let's get you guys some drinks.

361
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,101
Yeah, no, I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off.

362
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,353
No, you should stay.

363
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,521
No, really, I should go.

364
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,899
- Do you drink coffee?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,859
What? That's crazy.

366
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,986
So does my friend here.

367
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,988
You two, tomorrow.

368
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,823
Shoop! Coffee.

369
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,159
Yeah, I could do that. You want to?

370
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,203
I... yeah... yeah.

371
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,038
That'd be... that's great.

372
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,498
9:00 okay?

373
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,087
Oh, you're serious.

374
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,715
Is 11:30 okay?

375
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,550
Yeah, that works.

376
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,135
Hey.

377
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,345
Hi.

378
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,721
Can we talk?

379
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,015
Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay.

380
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,642
See you tomorrow?

381
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,394
Yeah, yeah. See you then.

382
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,479
Okay.

383
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,232
Hey, Vanessa.

384
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,862
Don't sweat that guy.

385
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,032
She only had eyes for you.

386
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,909
Okay.

387
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,411
Good night, Nat.

388
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,705
Good night, Ethan.

389
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,091
Can I help you?

390
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,426
Sorry.

391
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,136
I just...

392
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,804
just the best book of all time.

393
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,141
I just like holding it, I guess.

394
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,851
Best book of all time?

395
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,352
Well, one of them, sure.

396
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,313
Have you ever noticed
how everyone around here

397
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,273
speaks in wild hyperbole?

398
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,608
Everything's the best.

399
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,818
Like, "He's the best professor ever",

400
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,446
or, "This is the best
patty melt on the planet",

401
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,281
as if they've sampled
every possible variety

402
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,991
of professor and patty melt,

403
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,244
which is, as we know, logistically
impossible.

404
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,959
Okay.

405
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,006
All right, do we have enough time for that?

406
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,178
- Hey.
- Hey.

407
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,179
Am I super late?

408
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,680
No. You want a coffee?

409
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,683
No, I'll just drink yours.

410
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,101
You okay?

411
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,437
I don't know yet.

412
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,444
I smell like beer. Do you smell that?

413
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,532
Yeah, actually, you do.

414
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,038
I... I need to excuse myself just...

415
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,249
just for a...

416
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,720
Sorry about that.

417
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,931
Back there.

418
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,724
You walked away, and I was just wondering

419
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,145
why I was being rude to
someone who loves the same writer I do.

420
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,232
And I don't have an answer for that.

421
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,316
Okay.

422
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,736
Okay, so yeah...

423
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,863
I'll just...

424
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,323
My grades tanked senior year.

425
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,076
That book was the only
thing I wanted to read.

426
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,369
You liking it?

427
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,622
Yeah.

428
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,499
It's my second time reading it, actually.

429
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,710
That's impressive.

430
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,836
It's not short.

431
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,045
Yeah, I know.

432
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,672
You know, he said the purpose of fiction

433
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,257
was to combat loneliness.

434
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,925
That's good.

435
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,302
I never heard that.

436
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,386
Yeah.

437
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,929
Well, on the other hand,

438
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,140
spending most of your
time with an 1,100-page book

439
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,100
tends to put a dent in your social life.

440
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,185
Yeah.

441
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,690
Loneliness
simultaneously increased and decreased.

442
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,525
Hey.

443
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,485
What, you guys know each other?

444
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,280
Yeah, we had Symbolic Logic first semester.

445
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,781
Zibby.

446
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,867
Right. Dean, hi.

447
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,619
- Hey.
- I'm Jesse, by the way.

448
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,120
Okay.

449
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,626
Interesting guy.

450
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,793
Yeah.

451
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,004
I can't believe he's even back here.

452
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,797
Why? What do you mean?

453
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,634
He had a manic episode last year.

454
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,928
Eventually, they took him to a hospital

455
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,805
and, I don't know, calmed
him down, I guess.

456
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,974
He's supposed to be,
like, the smartest guy ever.

457
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,645
Everything okay?

458
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,105
Yeah, everything's great.

459
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,607
I puked.

460
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,151
That's gross.

461
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,611
Sorry, you did not need to hear that.

462
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,571
Come on, let's... let's walk.

463
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,619
My parents really liked you.

464
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,912
That's nice.

465
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,039
I like them.

466
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,583
You're really lucky to
have parents like that.

467
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,126
Like what?

468
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,836
Like, I don't know.

469
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,005
Around, first of all.

470
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,758
Still together so they can
fret over you as a team.

471
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,343
Yeah, I guess.

472
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,012
I like them best when
they're not being so parental,

473
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,766
which is, like, 1% of the time.

474
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,435
Oh, I thought of this great trick

475
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,687
for having them annoy me less.

476
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,854
- Want to hear it?
- Okay.

477
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,690
Okay, I decided to treat my parents

478
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,149
like they're always drunk.

479
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,110
No, really, it works.

480
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,737
Any time they say
something irritating or offensive,

481
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,365
I'm just like, "Oh, I
can't get mad at them."

482
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,367
They're drunk. It's not their fault".

483
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,619
And why should I take advice
from drunk people seriously?

484
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,538
That's great.

485
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,456
Do you like classical music?

486
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,041
Yeah, sure.

487
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,211
Okay, I took this music
survey class last year.

488
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,046
Oh, my God!

489
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,007
It totally changed my life.

490
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,971
I'm really happy I ran into you last night.

491
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,764
Yeah, yeah, me too.

492
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,725
It's random.

493
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,187
Who was that guy?

494
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,731
What guy?

495
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,274
The... last night, that guy.

496
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:31,237
Oh, his name is Eric.

497
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,489
Eric.

498
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,075
Is Eric your fella?

499
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,037
No.

500
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,290
No.

501
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:46,836
You know, I think I like
almost everything about this place

502
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,630
but the dude situation.

503
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,049
Not great?

504
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,759
No one, like, dates.

505
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,388
Everyone's so casual about it all.

506
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,766
Same as when I was here.

507
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,894
Yeah.

508
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,440
I guess there's part of me that's
a little old-fashioned.

509
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,989
Well, on behalf

510
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,619
of all current and
former 18- to 22-year-olds,

511
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,288
I'd like to apologize.

512
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,040
Forgive us.

513
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,875
Seriously.

514
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,795
We know not what we do.

515
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,134
I think one of the things

516
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,345
I loved the most about being here

517
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,056
was the feeling that anything was possible.

518
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,309
It's just infinite choices ahead of you.

519
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,271
You'd get out of school,
and anything could happen.

520
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,691
And then you do get out, and...

521
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,943
life happens, you know?

522
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,402
Decisions get made.

523
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,447
And then all those many
choices you had in front of you

524
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,324
are no longer really there.

525
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,909
At a certain point, you just got to go,

526
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,495
"Oh, I guess this is how it's going down".

527
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:07,166
And there's just something a
little depressing about that.

528
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,462
Well, don't you think you're
romanticizing youth a bit much?

529
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,173
You know, 'cause it's just
as hard and annoying

530
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,718
to be young as it is to
be old, I'm assuming.

531
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,138
Not that you're old, 'cause,
you know, you're not.

532
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,684
Look, I get the whole "we're
all equal" argument,

533
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,436
and it's kind of true, but
it's also kind of not true.

534
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:32,358
Like, okay, I feel different
now than I felt when I was here,

535
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,320
and I hate to break this
to you, but so will you.

536
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,197
So you're saying things suck?

537
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,283
I should prepare myself for suckiness?

538
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,619
No, a liberal arts education
solves all your problems.

539
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,954
Thank God!

540
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,372
Worth every penny.

541
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,004
We should hug.

542
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,422
What?

543
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,299
I mean, we could keep talking,

544
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,304
but I think it would be
better if we hugged.

545
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,514
Come on.

546
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,891
Okay.

547
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,395
- Who starts?
- I do.

548
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,730
- Okay.
- Here we go.

549
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,786
God, so you were here a long time ago.

550
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,330
Okay.

551
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,540
- I mean...
- Enough, enough.

552
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,088
That's... I mean, I just
mean because I thought,

553
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,174
with the greenhouses...

554
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:42,428
Hey, before you go, I thought
you might like these,

555
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,847
'cause I don't really need
'em anymore and here.

556
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,642
Look at this one.

557
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,979
No?

558
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,314
Nah.

559
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,774
Oh, please, that's a great shirt.

560
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,692
You know the trouble I
caused in this shirt?

561
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,902
I can only imagine.

562
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,112
You got no taste on top of everything else.

563
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,989
Oh, my God, what a beautiful shirt.

564
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,616
- Not giving it to you anyway.
- All right.

565
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,784
Oh, it feels great!

566
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,957
Hello?

567
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,251
Oh, hi.

568
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,796
No, no, he's... he's still here.

569
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,005
Yeah, hold on.

570
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,802
Zibby.

571
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,429
Hello?

572
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,597
You haven't left yet.

573
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,974
- No.
- Good.

574
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,476
I need to see you before you go.

575
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,645
Will you meet me at the bookstore?

576
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,564
Say yes.

577
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,150
Yes.

578
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,403
Okay.

579
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,154
She's asking about a book I recommended.

580
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,365
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

581
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,783
Be a gentleman. Walk me to my car.

582
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,159
All right, all right.

583
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,328
Thanks for the shirts.
I'll get them next time, okay?

584
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,372
Yeah, you'll be on the road,
and you'll be saying,

585
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,533
"Oh, maybe I'll call him up".

586
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

587
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,509
Sorry, I don't want to
hold you up or anything,

588
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,636
but I...

589
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,929
I made this for you.

590
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,098
Burned it, whatever.

591
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,350
It's music from the survey class

592
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,518
I was telling you about.

593
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,021
Classical, baroque, opera.

594
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,482
This is great.

595
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,234
I know none of this.

596
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,403
Who says we always have to be listening

597
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,821
to obscure indie bands, right?

598
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,364
Right.

599
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,575
So yeah, I don't know.

600
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:31,704
This is all music I never thought
I'd like or care about,

601
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,706
and this class just...

602
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,167
well, you know how you can
be told something so many times

603
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,127
and it's like, "Whatever",

604
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,712
and then you have a great teacher

605
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,963
take you through it,

606
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:46,010
and suddenly it's like, "Beethoven, whoa".

607
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,970
Yeah.

608
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,472
This is really great. Thank you.

609
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,142
I wish I had come with something for you.

610
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:56,520
Well, you know what you could do?

611
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,441
You could write me a letter.

612
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,567
I could do that.

613
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,902
Handwritten, I mean,

614
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,278
like with a pen or something.

615
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,822
Yeah, paper.

616
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,075
Maybe seal it with some red wax.

617
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,826
I could listen to this while I'm writing.

618
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,454
Right, it'll be like full-on 17th century.

619
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,664
Right, right.

620
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,125
So I don't have your address.

621
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,710
Oh, 108 is my P.O. Box,

622
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,253
and you can figure out the rest, right?

623
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:27,176
I also... I put my number
on the inside of the case.

625
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,969
Yes, you did.

626
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,596
You know, in case you ever...

627
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,680
whatever.

628
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,475
Yeah, right.

629
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,643
Okay.

630
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,313
- Well...
- Well...

631
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,439
Yeah.

632
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,941
- Bye.
- Bye.

633
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,120
Professor Fairfield.

634
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,039
Jesse Fisher.

635
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,041
I...

636
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,127
I took your British
Romantic literature class

637
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,422
when I was here as a student.

638
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,299
And?

639
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,471
And I loved it.

640
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,439
Great.

641
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,159
Hey, Dean.

642
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,996
I know it's bad for you.

643
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,374
Just quit when you graduate,
like everyone else.

644
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,042
Sweet ride.

645
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,502
You jerk.

646
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,171
It's a rental.

647
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,507
I'm not the best at flying.

648
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,717
I can understand that.

649
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:50,759
Where you headed?

650
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,969
Back to my dorm.

651
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,180
Get in. I'll give you a lift.

652
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,942
So you went here, right?

653
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,027
I did.

654
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,069
You liked it?

655
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,696
A lot.

656
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,865
I mean, you block out the bad memories...

657
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,826
writing a senior thesis, February.

658
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,578
Yeah, February here sucks.

659
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,246
Yeah, it's horrible.

660
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:24,043
So other than February, things
are good for you here?

661
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,296
I wouldn't say that.

662
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,884
You want to... you can
tell me about it if you want.

663
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,556
Well it's not exactly a secret.

664
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:44,063
Last year, I kind of lost my mind a bit.

665
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,564
I don't really remember much of it,

666
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:50,361
but apparently I got up to
some pretty amusing antics.

667
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:55,241
So now they've got me on
this pretty heavy stuff,

668
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,244
which I guess allows me to function,

669
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,747
but it also makes
everything seem underwater,

670
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,792
which is not as pleasant as it sounds.

671
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,503
Why'd you come back?

672
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,798
My mom's a nurse.

673
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,967
She raised me on her own.

674
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,427
I got a full ride.

675
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,973
She's...

676
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,267
so proud I'm here.

677
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,984
Thanks for the lift.

678
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,851
<i>"Dear Zibby, I can't thank you enough"</i>

679
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,729
<i>for introducing me to this music.</i>

680
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,397
<i>Beyond just genuinely loving it,</i>

681
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,651
<i>I feel it's quietly altering
my feeling about New York City,</i>

682
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,110
<i>with which I've always had</i>

683
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,404
<i>a slightly conflicted relationship.</i>

684
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,074
<i>I've found that if you
replace the horns and the shouting</i>

685
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,993
<i>with, say, Schubert or Telemann,</i>

686
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>the city becomes unbearably beautiful.</i>

687
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,208
<i>After years of thinly
disguised rage on both our parts,</i>

688
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,878
<i>it's like the music has mediated
a truce between us.</i>

689
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,838
<i>Some early favorites.</i>

690
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,799
<i>Massenet's Meditation.</i>

691
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,259
<i>If a more beautiful piece of
music has ever been composed,</i>

692
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,886
<i>I don't know it.</i>

693
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,555
<i>That Brandenburg concerto is no joke,</i>

694
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,809
<i>and I echo your
sentiment regarding Beethoven.</i>

695
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,937
<i>I have no idea</i>

696
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,232
<i>what the Vivaldi piece from
Giustino is actually about,</i>

697
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,235
<i>but to me, it suggests deception,</i>

698
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,363
<i>some kind of elegant double-crossing.</i>

699
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,369
<i>It makes me feel like I'm a double agent</i>

700
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,706
<i>knee deep in some kind of sexy espionage.</i>

701
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,715
<i>I've decided the
Wagner overture you included</i>

702
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,550
<i>should come with a warning label.</i>

703
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,760
<i>According to some quick online research,</i>

704
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,220
<i>the opera deals with the struggle</i>

705
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,472
<i>between sacred and profane love,</i>

706
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,518
<i>which is arguably the
only struggle there is.</i>

707
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,979
<i>The other day, I was crossing the street,</i>

708
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,480
<i>lost in my head about something,</i>

709
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,191
<i>a not uncommon state of affairs.</i>

710
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,901
<i>I was listening to the overture,</i>

711
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,653
<i>and as the music began to swell,</i>

712
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:26,535
<i>I suddenly realized that I
had hands and legs and a torso</i>

713
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,413
<i>and that I was
surrounded by people and cars.</i>

714
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,226
<i>It's hard to explain exactly what happened.</i>

715
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,271
<i>But I felt in that moment that the divine,</i>

716
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,608
<i>however we may choose
to define such a thing,</i>

717
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,611
<i>surely dwells as much in
the concrete and taxicabs</i>

718
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,572
<i>as it does in the
rivers, lakes, and mountains.</i>

719
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:08,243
<i>Grace, I realized, is
neither time-nor place-dependent.</i>

720
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,205
<i>All we need is the right soundtrack.</i>

721
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,166
<i>I suppose this new
infusion of music in my life is,</i>

722
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,418
<i>at the very least, making me reconsider</i>

723
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,295
<i>"my hostility to dead, white males".</i>

724
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,507
<i>"And I've you to thank for that."</i>

725
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,550
<i>How's things, by the way?</i>

726
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,596
<i>"Your friend, Jesse Fisher".</i>

727
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,225
<i>Jesse, things is good.</i>

728
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,685
<i>So happy you're loving the music.</i>

729
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>I felt my whole life got an upgrade</i>

730
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,523
<i>when I took that class.</i>

731
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,316
<i>The thing that floors me most</i>

732
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,694
<i>is that human beings wrote that music.</i>

733
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,656
<i>Are people writing
music like that nowadays?</i>

734
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,033
<i>If they are, I don't know about it.</i>

735
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,202
<i>I hope you've fallen in love with the piece</i>

736

757

14th and staying at the inn,</i>

790

<i>but I will be available for
walks, strolls, saunters,</i>

791
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,880
<i>ambles, and promenades.</i>

Hey.

795
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,581
So, Bob...

796
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,669
I've been asking myself a
lot of tough questions lately.

797
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,754
Everybody knows I made a whole stink

798
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,965
about leaving this
place, you know, how it's time...

799
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,049
How if you'd look back,

800
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,426
you'd turn into a pillar of salt.

801
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,262
Yeah, all that. That's...

802
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:06,226
I think I may have spoken too soon.

803
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,274
I think... I think I still
got a little gas in the tank is all.

804
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,692
I just...

805
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,403
Well, Peter, you have no bigger
fan around here than me.

806
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,780
Thank you.

807
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,200
When you announced your
plans, we were all sad to see you go,

808
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,702
but you insisted that it was time.

809
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,288
Right, which I thought it was.

810
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,374
We hired someone,

811
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,668
young guy out of UVA.

812
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,087
Very impressive candidate.

813
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,381
He was our first choice, actually.

814
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,384
We didn't think we would
get him, but we did.

815
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,888
You said you wanted nothing
to do with the search.

816
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,432
Right, right. No, I...

817
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,560
I just...

818
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,687
I just didn't think it would move so fast.

819
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,649
Well, there was unanimous
enthusiasm for the candidate,

820
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,278
so things just moved
along faster than normal.

821
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,407
Bob.

822
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,533
Give me this one.

823
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,495
Peter, we can't.

824
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,456
The department has spent
thousands of dollars

825
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,582
on this search.

826
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,334
He's turned down other offers.

827
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,252
You know what goes into this sort of thing.

828
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,297
I hired you, Bob.

829
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,424
You don't have to tell me how this w...

830
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,136
And let me tell you,

831
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,432
there was not unanimous enthusiasm
for you back then.

832
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,100
It took a lot of arm-twisting on my part

833
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,519
to get people to come around.

834
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,774
And now, 20 years later, the only reason

835
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,943
that you're the chairman
of this goddamn department

836
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,611
is 'cause I loathe politics!

837
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,156
And you, for reasons which
I cannot fathom, do not.

838
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:49,371
In fact, you seem to
have a real taste for it.

839
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,969
I'm asking...

840
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,391
I'm asking a favor.

841
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,642
Listen.

842
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,853
Just give me this one, Bob, okay?

843
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,231
I need three more years.

844
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,820
I'm sorry.

845
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,989
There's nothing I can do.

846
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,502
Hey.

847
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,796
Hi.

848
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,006
Oh, hey.

849
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,590
Jesse, you remember Vanessa, right?

850
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,343
- Yeah, hi.
- You're back.

851
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,469
Yeah.

852
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,599
So I should...

853
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,603
yeah, I got some stuff to do.

854
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,944
So this is your room.

855
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,070
Yeah. Fancy?

856
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,196
Yeah.

857
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,157
Forgot how small these are.

858
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,742
Good training for living in New York.

859
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,912
So are you gonna see Professor Hoberg

860
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,706
while you're here?

861
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,374
You know, probably not.

862
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,462
And, you know, if you...
if you run into him,

863
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,213
maybe don't mention that I'm here.

864
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,051
- Okay.
- Okay.

865
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:29,471
Do you want to sit?

866
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,931
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,231
So I should tell you,

868
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,567
I feel a little weird about being here.

869
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,985
Why? Don't.

870
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,904
Well, I don't know if you know this,

871
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,074
but I'm a few years older than you.

872
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,533
You are?

873
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,077
Just a few, yeah,

874
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,787
and I'm not necessarily saying...

875
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,413
I don't want to get ahead of myself here.

876
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,539
It's just...

877
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,874
Oh, wait, sorry.

878
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,920
You... did you think this
was, like, a romantic thing?

879
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,633
Just kidding.

880
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,302
Oh, my...

881
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,429
Come here.

882
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,815
Try not to overthink things, okay?

883
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,274
You're talking to the wrong guy.

884
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,569
Well, look.

885
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,613
We connect really well, don't you think?

886
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,408
We do, yeah.

887
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,743
I just can't figure out if
it's because you're advanced

888
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,829
or because I'm stunted.

889
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,331
It's because I'm advanced.

890
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,125
Maybe.

891
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,669
But I'm also a little stunted.

892
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,842
Look, I want to take things slowly, okay?

893
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,593
Yeah, okay.

894
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,138
Me too. Me too.

895
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,807
But I would like to kiss you

896
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,976
on your forehead.

897
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,020
Can I kiss you on your forehead?

898
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,523
Say yes.

899
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,233
Yes.

900
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,242
And your chin?

901
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,660
May I kiss your chin?

902
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,138
Sorry. Hi, sorry.

903
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,515
Just need to grab something.

904
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,899
Roommates.

905
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,735
Can we... are you hungry?

906
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,028
I could eat.

907
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,362
Yeah?

908
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,990
Maybe we could go into
town and grab something?

909
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,074
That'll take too long.

910
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,243
I have class at 2:00.

911
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:03,541
But I know a place
that's good and even closer.

912
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,574
Hey, Dean.

913
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,204
You get a job here?

914
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,288
I wish.

915
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,290
Hey, I seem to have lost my friend.

916
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,500
You mind if I...

917
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,131
What are you working on?

918
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:56,052
Yeah, it's this...

919
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,762
novel.

920
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,097
Good for you.

921
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,181
I guess.

922
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,266
You happy with it?

923
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,433
Not really.

924
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,772
How you been? Any better?

925
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,275
No.

926
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,610
I kind of just wish this would all be over

927
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,070
as soon as possible.

928
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:20,326
Why did you love it here so much?

929
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,167
It's the only time you
get to do this, you know?

930
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,461
You get to sit around
and read books all day,

931
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,631
have really great
conversations about ideas.

932
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,885
People out in the world, they're
not really doing that.

933
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,262
Think about it.

934
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,431
You could go up to everyone
here and say, "I'm a poet",

935
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,350
and no one will punch you in the face.

936
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,811
I mean, that's something.

937
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,396
Yeah.

938
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,816
I get that.

939
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,235
I just can't get around the fact

940
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:58,406
that I'm, like, aggressively unhappy here.

941
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,033
Jesse.

942
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,993
Jesse!

943
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,922
That's my number, if you ever want to talk.

944
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

945
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,327
Please tell me this is Vanessa's.

946
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,454
Nope, that's mine.

947
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,705
Wait, you actually read this?

948
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,831
Yeah.

949
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,124
All of it?

950
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,376
Yep.

951
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,087
Unironically?

952
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,215
Very sincerely.

953
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,842
What is it with you girls and vampires?

954
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:02,887
What's it about?

955
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,180
Vampires.

956
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,891
No, what's it about?

957
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,059
Vampires.

958
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,061
I don't understand. Is it good?

959
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,104
No.

960
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,398
I mean, yeah. But no.

961
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,399
Well, then why read it?

962
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,733
'Cause I like it.

963
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,361
That's no reason to read something.

964
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,697
Why else would you read something?

965
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,864
Seriously.

966
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,200
Many amazing books in the world.

967
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,618
Why would you read this?

968
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,079
Okay, I hate this conversation.

969
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,580
Can we stop?

970
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,915
Wait, this is a trilogy, right?

971
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,668
I'm afraid to answer that.

972
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,503
You've read three of these?

973
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,796
Have you ever read one of them?

974
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,214
What do you think?

975
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,134
How can you hate something
if you've never read it?

976
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,679
I mean, isn't that like what
repressive regimes do?

977
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,764
You want to burn books you don't like?

978
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,183
You're right. You know what I'm gonna do?

979
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,102
I'm gonna read this book, all of it.

980
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,146
And then we can discuss it.

981
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,231
- Right now?
- Yeah, why not?

982
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,233
I mean, how long can it take, really?

983
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,319
This is great, a little book club.

984
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,698
Seriously?

985
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,533
Yup.

986
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,452
See ya soon.

987
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,782
Oh, no, this isn't what it...

988
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,658
I'm reading it as a dare.

989
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,495
It's a bet, actually.

990
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,124
I loved your class!

991
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,198
Should I start?

992
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,033
Please.

993
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,118
Okay.

994
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,496
I liked it.

995
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,873
It was fun and stupid.

996
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,500
And it passed the time.

997
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,837
And it's not Tolstoy, but
it's also not television.

998
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,965
And it made me happy.

999
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,050
Now you.

1000
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,388
Thank you.

1001
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,183
This...

1002
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,394
is the worst book

1003
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,146
ever written

1004
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,440
in English.

1005
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:05,987
So there are worse books
written in other languages?

1006
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,655
Probably not,

1007
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,241
unless this book is
translated into other languages.

1008
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,909
Okay, we really...

1009
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,035
we don't need to do this.

1010
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,620
No, please, let's.

1011
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,790
I need to know how you read these...

1012
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,459
I guess you call them sentences...

1013
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,753
close the book, and feel anything

1014
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,880
other than offended and sad?

1015
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,256
Well, millions of people like it.

1016
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,049
So when millions of people like something,

1017
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,217
that means it's good?

1018
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,844
No, it means millions of people like it.

1019
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,139
These books make people happy.

1020
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,474
We don't always have to
be thinking about poli-sci

1021
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,768
or reading Chaucer, which,
by the way, I hated.

1022
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,645
You're not supposed to like it.

1023
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,230
But then why read it?

1024
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,774
You love college so much, right?

1025
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,193
Isn't it all about
understanding different points of view?

1026
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,945
It's also about developing taste.

1027
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,780
That was snobby. You're a snob.

1028
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,948
No, I'm not.

1029
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,116
Yes, you are.

1030
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,618
You think it's cool to hate things.

1031
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,453
And it's not. It's boring.

1032
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,704
Talk about what you love,

1033
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,623
and keep quiet about what you don't.

1034
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,750
Look, I know how this
sounds, but trust me.

1035
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,460
This is a big deal, okay?

1036
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,920
This country is in bad shape,

1037
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,505
and it has to do, in large part, I think,

1038
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,550
with people liking
things that are very, very bad.

1039
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,385
But according to you.

1040
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,763
Why are you the one who gets to
decide what's good and bad?

1041
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,473
And do you only want to surround yourself

1042
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,391
with people who've
read the same books as you?

1043
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,645
I guess we're gonna have to
move on to a specific example...

1044
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,857
Where are you?

1045
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,150
What do you mean?

1046
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,152
I mean, you are somewhere,

1047
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,487
but it's not here.

1048
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,198
No, I'm... I'm here.

1049
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,492
So why are we spending all our time

1050
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:37,036
having a stupid argument about a book?

1051
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,008
Hey, Peter.

1052
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,843
Zibby.

1053
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,565
Peter.

1054
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,692
Peter.

1055
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,237
What the hell are you doing here?

1056
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,032
I don't know.

1057
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,666
You know how old I am?

1058
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,001
No, how old are you?

1059
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,044
It's none of your goddamn business.

1060
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:31,173
Do you know how old I feel like I am?

1061
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,884
19.

1062
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:38,222
Since I was 19, I have never felt not 19.

1063
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,059
But I shave my face, and
I look in the mirror,

1064
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,394
and I'm forced to say,

1065
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:46,564
"This is not a
19-year-old staring back at me".

1066
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,944
Teaching here all these years,

1067
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,239
I've had to be very clear with myself

1068
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,533
that even though I'm
surrounded by 19-year-olds

1069
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,077
and I may have felt 19,

1070
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,371
I'm not 19 anymore.

1071
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,290
You follow me?

1072
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,793
Yeah.

1073
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:13,132
Nobody feels like an adult.

1074
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,468
It's the world's dirty secret.

1075
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,941
How perfect is the universe?

1076
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,360
You're still here?

1077
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,196
Lucky for you,

1078
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:38,949
'cause you look like you
could use a friend.

1079
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,165
Did you know there's so many preservatives
in the food we eat

1080
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,875
that they're finding it's taking longer

1081
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:52,004
for our bodies to decompose once we die?

1082
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,297
No way. Really?

1083
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,467
Preservatives, man. It's messed up.

1084
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,305
Want some good news?

1085
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,808
Please.

1086
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,936
Caterpillars... give me my hat.

1087
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,730
They're just scooting along, right,

1088
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,690
being caterpillars.

1089
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,777
At some point, these cells show
up called imaginal cells.

1090
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,487
Scientists don't know where they come from

1091
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,822
or why they appear,

1092
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:21,200
but these imaginal cells
show up inside the caterpillar

1093
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,160
and say, "Get psyched, caterpillar!"

1094
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,663
It's
butterfly-turning-into time".

1095
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,958
And what do all the
other caterpillar cells do

1096
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,960
when these imaginal cells show up?

1097
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,545
I have no idea.

1098
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:33,671
They attack 'em!

1099
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,339
Try to kill 'em!

1100
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,342
They're like, "Screw you, imaginal cells."

1101
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,136
We're happy being a caterpillar.

1102
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,887
"Get lost!"

1103
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,975
But eventually, the
imaginal cells keep growing

1104
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,853
and overtake the destiny of the caterpillar

1105
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,188
and will it into this cocoon.

1106
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,065
And then guess what happens next.

1107
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,026
The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

1108
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,029
The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

1109
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,197
That's awesome.

1110
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,532
I know it is!

1111
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,242
Yeah, that's good.

1112
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:07,746
And that is why there
is no reason to be afraid,

1113
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:11,750
because everything is okay.

1114
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,671
Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.

1115
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,967
It has to be true.

1116
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,720
There can be no other way.

1117
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,018
You know, I'm not
even sure if you're real.

1118
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,811
I mean, seriously.

1119
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,814
It's all true, brother.

1120
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,399
Whatever you believe.

1121
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,569
What is that?

1122
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,612
What are you drinking?

1123
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,114
H to the 2 to the O.

1124
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,657
You should have some.

1125
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,910
Got to stay hydrated.

1126
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,288
All right.

1127
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,216
Oh, thanks.

1128
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,401
You with me, bro?

1129
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:24,490
Yeah.

1130
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:28,577
I like you, Nat.

1131
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,830
Thanks for being my friend.

1132
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,124
Easiest thing in the world.

1133
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,461
I enjoyed this.

1134
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,463
I'm off.

1135
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,134
You go get her, man.

1136
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,350
Okay.

1137
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,148
Be love, man.

1138
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,608
Be love!

1139
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,038
You seem happy.

1140
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,165
I am.

1141
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,501
What happened?

1142
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,586
I don't know.

1143
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,964
Something.

1144
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,091
Can I tell you some things?

1145
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,426
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1146
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,430
Okay, well, except for the book thing,

1147
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:33,267
which was genuinely super annoying,

1148
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:38,856
I... I feel really good about you.

1149
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:44,695
It's been a while since I
felt that way about someone.

1150
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:48,324
And I like it.

1151
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,784
Yeah, me too.

1152
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:54,079
I want you to stay here with me tonight.

1153
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,042
You have a roommate.

1154
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:01,545
She's sleeping elsewhere.

1155
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,425
So will you stay here?

1156
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,888
Yes.

1157
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,599
Good.

1158
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,392
But I have to tell you something.

1159
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,734
This... it would be my...

1160
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,403
first time.

1161
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,576
But I want to.

1162
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,870
With you.

1163
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:41,168
Okay...

1164
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,961
I have to...

1165
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,254
hold on.

1166
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,965
I'll... I'll be back in a second, okay?

1167
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,967
Okay.

1168
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,163
I should never have told you that.

1169
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,748
No, no, it's good.

1170
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:24,545
I'm... I'm glad you did.

1171
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,922
So is that a problem?

1172
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,384
Well, yeah, it is.

1173
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,469
Why?

1174
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,682
Okay, well, first of all, I'm 35.

1175
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,600
- You don't look it.
- Thank you.

1176
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,810
Plus, it doesn't bother me.

1177
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,145
Well, it bothers me.

1178
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,312
Well, it shouldn't.

1179
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,399
Age is a stupid thing to obsess over.

1180
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,860
What if reincarnation is real?

1181
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,361
Think about that.

1182
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,823
What if I'm, like,
thousands of years older than you?

1183
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,492
Okay, that's not really a sound argument.

1184
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,827
Why not?

1185
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,620
Because it's like saying,

1186
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,373
"What if reality is all an illusion?"

1187
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,375
Then there are no consequences to anything.

1188
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,252
We're completely off the hook.

1189
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:08,380
And I believe in consequences.

1190
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,507
No, you believe in guilt.

1191
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,843
Maybe.

1192
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:18,265
But guilt before we act is called morality.

1193
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,689
Why did you come back here?

1194
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,025
To see you, but I didn't know that you...

1195
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,359
Why should that matter?

1196
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,945
I mean, isn't it, I don't know, flattering?

1197
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,072
Listen.

1198
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,866
Elizabeth.

1199
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,538
Sex is really complicated, okay?

1200
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,875
I didn't quite understand
that when I was younger,

1201
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,335
but I do now.

1202
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,587
Okay, look, I didn't
sign one of those contracts

1203
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,464
when I was in high school, okay?

1204
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,300
I'm not a prude or whatever.

1205
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:57,721
It's just, I never met
anyone that I trusted

1206
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:02,100
or even liked enough

1207
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,102
until now.

1208
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,233
I can't.

1209
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,407
Are you not attracted to me?

1210
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,618
No. I mean, yes, I am.

1211
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,079
It's just,

1212
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:28,335
I also care about you a
lot already, somehow.

1213
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:31,922
So essentially,

1214
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,257
you don't want to sleep with me

1215
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:37,386
because you like and respect me too much.

1216
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,391
Basically.

1217
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,851
Yeah.

1218
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,271
That's, like, the saddest thing ever.

1219
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,689
Look, I want to be in your life.

1220
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,898
I do.

1221
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,693
Yeah, I already have
an older brother, okay?

1222
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,653
And I don't need some mentor.

1223
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,452
I can't just say yes to everything.

1224
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,416
Elizabeth.

1225
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,334
Stop calling me that.

1226
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,419
What?

1227
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,628
No one calls me that.

1228
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,088
You need to leave right now.

1229
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,340
I'm really upset, and you need to go.

1230
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,301
Okay.

1231
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,098
Get out!

1232
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:37,029

1236

01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,420
You do?

1238
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,339
Not really.

01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,183
Yeah.

1243
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:12,105

01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:41,009

1255
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,441
Hey.

1256
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,486
Can you get me a beer?

1257
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,862
Yeah, have mine.

1258
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,533
Of course, I'm thrilled.

1259
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,451
Newly minted PhD.

1260
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,994
I'm feeling very fancy

1261
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:11,665
and officially teaching
Ode on a Grecian Urn

1262
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,041
for the first time.

1263
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,376
It's like heaven, right?

1264
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,627
Right. Right, right, right.

1265
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,462
And I decide to be a little dramatic.

1266
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,714
I'm really gonna go for it

1267
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,382
and just recite the whole thing out loud.

1268
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,425
What the hell, right?

1269
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:22,843
Sure.

1270
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,972
And it's going very
well, if I do say so myself.

1271
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,642
And as I reach the immortal final lines

1272
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,104
of one of the great
poems ever written in English,

1273
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,566
I hear myself say the following:

1274
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,361
"Beauth is trudy, trudy beauth".

1275
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,781
"That is all ye know on
Earth and all ye need know".

1276
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,491
That is great.

1277
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,785
Great story.

1278
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,662
When did you fall for the Romantics?

1279
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,164
Was it, like... I'm just curious,

1280
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,499
but was it in college or grad school?

1281
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,460
'Cause I knew almost
nothing about those guys

1282
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,295
before your class.

1283
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,629
Your class.

1284
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,715
I can gush, right?

1285
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,341
I mean, I still think about it.

1286
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,760
It's just...

1287
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,222
What?

1288
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,808
You're very enthusiastic.

1289
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:15,353
I guess.

1290
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,992
I have a car.

1291
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,580
Okay.

1292
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:40,796
I would like for you to get in it with me,

1293
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,925
and I would like to drive us somewhere.

1294
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,846
Where?

1295
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,397
Don't worry about the fries.

1296
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,817
They know me here.

1297
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,699
Yo, Eric, what's up?

1298
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,243
Oh, hey, man.

1299
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,141
Okay, you got to go.

1300
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,977
What?

1301
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,312
Out. Go, now.

1302
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,398
Are you serious?

1303
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,941
Yep.

1304
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:47,195
Yeah, I don't have to
stay the night or anything,

1305
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,573
but could I... could I
at least catch my breath?

1306
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:52,075
Sure.

1307
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,744
How long do you think that'll be?

1308
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,665
- What?
- No, no.

1309
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,167
It's just funny to me all of a sudden.

1310
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,212
What about it is amusing to you?

1311
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:08,592
Your post-coital cigarette,
for one, is amusing to me.

1312
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,176
What, you never smoked?

1313
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,178
- No, I did.
- But you quit.

1314
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,555
- Yeah.
- Pussy.

1315
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,058
Okay, you are the same Judith Fairfield

1316
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,935
I took British Romantic literature from?

1317
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,313
"From whom I took British
Romantic literature",

1318
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,023
and yes, that's me.

1319
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,442
But just because we screwed,
don't assume we're suddenly...

1320
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,777
what is it you kids say nowadays?

1321
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,154
BFFs?

1322
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,447
Yeah, that's not really...

1323
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,365
I mean, what do we really
know about each other?

1324
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,034
You're a nonsmoker. Congratulations.

1325
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,702
You're going to live to be a hundred.

1326
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,787
But what does it matter
if your life is joyless?

1327
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,373
And it will be. Trust me.

1328
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,958
What's happening here?

1329
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,002
You're getting your
clothes and you're leaving,

1330
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,962
and I'm going to take an Ambien.

1331
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,047
No, I meant, what is hap...

1332
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,298
I mean, seriously.

1333
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,008
You weren't thinking we were gonna cuddle

1334
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,886
the rest of the night as
I read you Wordsworth?

1335
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,888
Not anymore.

1336
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,640
Good.

1337
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,767
I've taught at this
school for over 20 years.

1338
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,020
I've seen the emergence of
your kind like an infection...

1339
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:05,148
all these effete, overarticulate man-boys

1340
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,942
who never learned to toughen up.

1341
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,485
Don't be one of them.

1342
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:09,611
Go work with your hands.

1343
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:10,654
Build something.

1344
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,489
Punch someone in the face.

1345
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,241
Too bad Norman Mailer's dead.

1346
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,160
You guys would have been
perfect for each other.

1347
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,328
Shall I count to ten?

1348
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,329
Wait, just, can...

1349
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,915
hold on just one second, okay?

1350
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,088
You don't seem very happy.

1351
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,509
Your powers of deduction are stunning.

1352
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,928
You must have gone to a very good college.

1353
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,305
I'm just confused how...

1354
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,932
I mean, you're a tenured professor

1355
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,685
in one of the most
prestigious English departments

1356
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:42,727
in the country.

1357
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,562
That's not fulfilling?

1358
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,856
Sit through a faculty
meeting at a liberal arts college,

1359
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,316
Mr. Young Person.

1360
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,652
I assure you, you will
lose all faith in humanity.

1361
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,904
Okay, but what about the classroom?

1362
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,739
There had to have been some joy there.

1363
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,117
I mean, you were such a good teacher.

1364
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,202
Thank you.

1365
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,162
I like to teach.

1366
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,831
I used to love it.

1367
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,374
What happened?

1368
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:08,294
Life happened.

1369
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,672
Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit more.

1370
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,257
Well, that's all you're gonna get.

1371
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,385
Unlike you, I'm not from
the "let me tell you"

1372
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,096
"every sick, sordid
detail of my life" generation.

1373
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,723
I value discretion.

1374
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,766
I loathe self-pity.

1375
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,685
So let's just leave it at this:

1376
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,647
People are disappointing.

1377
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,399
Yeah, it's just, I would think...

1378
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,942
- Don't get comfortable.
- Sorry.

1379
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,152
I would just think

1380
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,571
that spending so much time with those poems

1381
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:38,241
would make you more, you
know, optimistic and hopeful.

1382
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,617
Nonsense.

1383
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,952
They were miserable men

1384
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,912
who were granted a few
moments of transcendence,

1385
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,414
and they had the talent and foresight

1386
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,583
to grab pen and paper and write it down.

1387
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,752
Byron was probably the happiest of the lot,

1388
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,921
only because he put his dick in everything.

1389
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,799
This is the saddest evening of my life.

1390
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,092
Get used to it.

1391
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:59,721
My advice to you is this:

1392
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:03,975
Put some armor around that
gooey little heart of yours.

1393
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:14,527
Well, at least I appreciate the irony.

1394
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,821
I just had the least
romantic night of my life

1395
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,573
with a Romantics professor.

1396
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,467
For what it's worth,

1397
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,637
I meant everything I said about your class.

1398
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:45,809
It opened something in me,

1399
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,812
and I'm grateful for it.

1400
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,898
And if my heart is gooey,

1401
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,819
you're at least
partially responsible for that.

1402
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,925
So you're still uninspired by admissions.

1403
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,802
Yeah, pretty much.

1404
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,138
No little Jesse Fishers out there?

1405
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,723
Well, if there are, I'm not meeting them.

1406
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,686
Well, maybe you're
just not recognizing them.

1407
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,813
Anyway,

1408
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,274
I do appreciate you coming by.

1409
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,692
I really do.

1410
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,152
It's great to see you one last time

1411
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,946
before I get the hell out of here.

1412
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:42,365
You feeling any better about things?

1413
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,450
Well,

1414
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,494
I tried to turn the clock back.

1415
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,873
It doesn't work.

1416
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:52,709
No, it doesn't.

1417
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,920
Now I just...

1418
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,299
I keep waiting to feel
more resolve somehow.

1419
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,886
What if I'm like one of those prisoners

1420
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,387
that gets paroled

1421
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,222
and finds he can't handle
life on the outside

1422
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,891
so he commits a petty crime

1423
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:12,937
so he can go back to what he knows?

1424
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,732
You think this place is a prison?

1425
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,653
Well, any place you
don't leave is a prison.

1426
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,578
Well, whatever.

1427
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:32,749
- Okay.
- Okay.

1428
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,544
Hey.

1429
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,005
You know why you're my second favorite
professor of all time?

1430
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,590
I have no idea.

1431
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,927
Because you had us read
books by authors you hated.

1432
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,933
Feel good about what you did here.

1433
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,979
Thank you.

1434
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:05,615
Get in your car now, and leave me be.

1435
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,344
<i>"Dear Zibby, even after all these months,"</i>

1436

1442
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:44,237

1446

1452
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:19,981
Hey.

1453
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,190
Hi.

1454
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,573
Are you here for this?

1455
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,870
I always notice you reading
it when you're in here.

1456
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,039
Yeah.

1457
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,790
Any bookstore I'm in, I have to read the...

1458
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:38,958
Last three pages.

1459
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,376
I know. They're devastating.

1460
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,005
Yeah.

1461
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:49,719
I'm Jesse.

1462
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,887
I'm Ana.

1463
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,139
- Hi.
- Hi.

1464
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,226
I love books.

1465
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,854
I do in, like, the dorkiest way possible.

1466
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,980
Oh, me too.

1467
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,357
It's a problem.

1468
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,444
Like, I love trees 'cause
they give us books.

1469
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,447
It's super cool of the
trees to do that, right?

1470
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,574
I'm actually...

1471
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,034
this is weird.

1472
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,286
I'm actually trying to read less.

1473
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,621
Why?

1474
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,998
I felt like I wasn't
watching enough television.

1475
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,836
No, I just... I started to
feel like reading about life

1476
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,923
was taking time away from
actually living life,

1477
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:30,426
so I'm trying to, like, accept
invitations to things,

1478
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,261
say "hi" to the world a little more.

1479
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,264
That sounds scary.

1480
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,599
It's going well?

1481
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,768
It's... okay.

1482
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,103
Most of the time when I'm out,

1483
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,646
I keep thinking I'd be so much happier

1484
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,356
in bed with a book,

1485
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:48,277
and that makes me feel not super cool.

1486
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,488
I still read tons.

1487
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:54,117
I just feel like I'm more
aware of a book's limitations.

1488
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,952
Does that make sense?

1489
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:59,205
Yeah, totally.

1490
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:00,540
How am I doing here?

1491
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,417
What? Here in this conversation?

1492
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,501
Yeah.

1493
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,838
Very well. You are doing great.

1494
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,804
So you maybe want to
get away from these books

1495
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,140
and walk somewhere?

1496
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,599
Yeah, okay.

1497
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,977
- Really?
- Sure, let's do it.

1498
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,020
Great. Great.

1499
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,398
And feel free to invite your
husband or boyfriend.

1500
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,316
They're both pretty busy right now, so...

1501
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,651
Probably just be us, then.

1502
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,195
Yeah. Just us.

1503
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,019
Hello.

1504
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,813
Oh, hi.

1505
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,857
It's Dean.

1506
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,526
Franzen? We like the same writer.

1507
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,904
Right, hey. Dean, what's up?

1508
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:16,949
You gave me your number,
and you told me to call you.

1509
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,494
Yeah. No, it's good to hear from you.

1510
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,870
How are you doing?

1511
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:25,291
I'm pretty good, yeah.

1512
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,168
Things...

1513
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:29,086
I've been...

1514
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,343
Dean?

1515
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,137
I just took a bunch of pills.

1516
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:40,765
What?

1517
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,059
I just took a lot of pills.

1518
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:46,354
How many?

1519
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,397
I don't know.

1520
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,736
I'm really scared.

1521
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,363
- Where are you?
- In my dorm.

1522
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,323
Stay... stay there, okay?

1523
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,991
Stay right there.

1524
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,910
Okay, yeah, just stay
ri... I'm gonna make a call,

1525
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,245
and I'm gonna call...

1526
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,038
I need you to stay by
the phone, though, okay?

1527
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,122
Dean?

1528
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:10,044
Miss Hanson to reception area, please.

1529
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,129
Miss Hanson.

1530
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,894
Hey.

1531
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,439
Hey, man.

1532
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,735
How you feeling?

1533
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:38,281
Kind of ridiculous.

1534
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,825
You didn't have to
drive all the way out here.

1535
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,161
I flew, you bastard.

1536
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,956
Thanks.

1537
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:51,294
For picking up the phone.

1538
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:54,297
I didn't know who else to call.

1539
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,635
Can I make a suggestion?

1540
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:00,970
Yeah.

1541
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,555
Stop reading this.

1542
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:04,140
Why?

1543
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:08,144
Because he killed himself,
and you're not gonna do that.

1544
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:11,063
You need to read something else.

1545
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:14,483
Listen, don't be a genius who dies young.

1546
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:15,985
Be one who dies old.

1547
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,987
Being old is cool.

1548
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,323
Grow old and die old.

1549
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,617
It's a better arc.

1550
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,327
Listen to me, man.

1551
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:29,665
This right now, all this
stuff you're feeling,

1552
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,917
this is a footnote, okay?

1553
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,794
You're gonna graduate,

1554
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,047
and you're gonna get out in the world

1555
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,507
and stumble into something
like contentment.

1556
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,761
I know it.

1557
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,846
Is that how it's been for you?

1558
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,890
Hell, no.

1559
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:51,354
But some days are all right, you know?

1560
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:54,607
Some days are like a gift,

1561
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,942
and some days suck.

1562
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,695
But all of that's okay.

1563
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,575
So I'm taking you off post-modernists.

1564
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,622
What are you prescribing?

1565
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,042
There are these vampire books.

1566
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:15,336
The kids love 'em.

1567
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:20,257
Trust me, they will
empty your mind completely.

1568
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,014
Why are you being so nice to me?

1569
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,394
You flew all the way back here to see me,

1570
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:34,605
and we had, like, two conversations.

1571
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:38,484
I have a soft spot for good readers.

1572
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,277
They're hard to find these days.

1573
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:04,969
I really did miss you.

1574
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:07,054
You know, we had this thing happening,

1575
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:12,017
and it was so exciting, and
then you were just gone.

1576
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,938
But it's okay now.

1577
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,065
I get it.

1578
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:28,200
I sometimes feel like I'm
looking down on myself,

1579
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:32,872
like there's this older, wiser me

1580
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:36,876
watching over this
19-year-old rough draft

1581
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:40,963
who's full of all this potential

1582
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:44,300
but has to live more

1583
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:48,763
to catch up with that other self somehow.

1584
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,766
And...

1585
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,142
I know I'll get there.

1586
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,145
It's just sometimes I think

1587
01:27:56,146 --> 01:28:00,775
I want to rush the process, you know?

1588
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,359
And I don't know.

1589
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:09,033
Maybe... maybe I thought you
were some sort of shortcut.

1590
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,164
Does that make any sense?

1591
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:22,963
If I wrote you, I would be like,

1592
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,883
"This is the best rough draft ever".

1593
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:38,145
Seriously?

1594
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:41,023
Roommates.

1595
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:49,949
Well, I should get back to adulthood.

1596
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,158
Yeah.

1597
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,078
See you there soon, I guess.

1598
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,875
Bye, Zibby.

1599
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,961
Bye, Jesse.

1600
01:29:56,266 --> 01:30:00,853
You're so beautiful and fascinating

1601
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:01,979
and age-appropriate.

1602
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,063
What?

1603
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,441
Oh, nothing.

01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,484
Look, you're getting wise.

1613
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,653
I'm getting old.

1614
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:54,990
Not the same thing.
I say you're getting wise.

1615
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,493
You worry about getting old?

1616
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:01,455
I think being old's gonna be okay.

1617
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,166
It's just the getting there that
kicks your ass, you know?

1618
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,460
You're gonna be a great old guy.

1619
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,753
Really?

1620
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,213
I feel like that's the nicest thing

1621
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,631
anyone's ever said to me.

1622
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,299
Unless it's a criticism,

1623
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,802
like, "You're already
judgmental and racist."

1624
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,679
You're gonna be a great old guy".

1625
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,140
No, I mean you'll wear baggy pants,

1626
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,017
and you'll have a little belly.

1627
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,979
And when you want more
coffee, you'll say to the waitress,

1628
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,356
"Could you warm this up for me, dear?"

1629
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:29,191
You're right.

1630
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,694
I will say that.

1631
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:34,238
I think you're gonna
be a great old person too.

1632
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,782
Thanks.

1633
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:43,205
I want to be an old lady with
long, gray hair in a ponytail.

1634
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,082
I can see it.

1635
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,875
You're still foxy. You still got it.

1636
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,544
That's what they're gonna say about you.

1637
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:49,586
"She's still got it".

1638
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,046
They're saying it now.

1639
