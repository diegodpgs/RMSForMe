1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:11,946
<i>Come to me</i>

2
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:15,177
<i>Come lie beside me</i>

3
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:20,216
<i>And don't deny me your love</i>

4
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:27,416
<i>Make sense of me</i>

5
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,903
<i>Walk through my doorway</i>

6
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:34,946
<i>Don't hide in the hallway
oh, love</i>

7
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,784
<i>Step over</i>

8
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:51,577
<i>I'll follow you down</i>

9
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:17,904
<i>In the name of whisky</i>

10
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,424
<i>In the name of song</i>

11
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,944
<i>You didn't look back</i>

12
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,783
<i>You didn't belong</i>

13
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,458
<i>In the name of reason</i>

14
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:31,098
<i>In the name of hope</i>

15
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,778
<i>In the name of religion</i>

16
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,218
<i>In the name of dope</i>

17
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:38,579
<i>In the name of freedom</i>

18
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,817
<i>You drifted away</i>

19
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:44,660
<i>To see the sun shining</i>

20
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,977
<i>On someone else's day</i>

21
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,818
<i>In the name of United</i>

22
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,378
<i>And the BBC</i>

23
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:04,978
<i>In the name of Georgie Best</i>

24
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,624
<i>And LSD</i>

25
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:10,775
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

26
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,903
<i>And His wife, the Spirit</i>

27
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:15,423
<i>You said you did not</i>

28
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,063
<i>They said you did</i>

29
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,578
<i>In the name of justice</i>

30
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:23,138
<i>In the name of fun</i>

31
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,858
<i>In the name of the Father</i>

32
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,418
<i>In the name of the Son</i>

33
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:43,136
<i>Call to me</i>

34
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:46,577
<i>No one is listening</i>

35
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:51,536
<i>I'm waiting to hear from you, love</i>

36
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,822
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

37
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:09,059
<i>Good. I never said "thank you"
for taking up our case.</i>

38
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,342
<i>Never thought I'd trust
an English person again...</i>

39
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,463
<i>especially a lawyer.</i>

40
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:17,904
<i>Anyhow, I'll be as accurate as I can
with names, dates and places...</i>

41
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:20,706
<i>anything that might help
in our defense.</i>

42
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,460
<i>To explain how I happened
to be in England in 1974...</i>

43
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,060
<i>at the time of the bombing...</i>

44
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:28,378
<i>I'd better take you back
to Northern Ireland, where I come from.</i>

45
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:32,221
<i>Belfast in the early '70s was chaos.</i>

46
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:34,148
<i>It was strange to see
soldiers on the street...</i>

47
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:37,219
<i>all of them terrified
of the civilian population...</i>

48
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,377
<i>any one of whom could be
an IRA gunman.</i>

49
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,738
<i>I was just a petty thief...</i>

50
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,863
<i>stealing scrap metal.</i>

51
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:47,415
<i>In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.</i>

52
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,503
Get down, Gerry,
for fuck's sake.

53
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,736
Tommo!

54
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,422
<i>The IRA had already
given me three warnings...</i>

55
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:59,977
<i>and when a British patrol mistook me for
a gunman, that got me into real trouble.</i>

56
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,944
Is he trying to fucking shoot us?

57
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:13,021
There's a sniper! He's up there!

58
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,020
I can't get a bead on him.

59
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,382
Shoot him
before he fucking kills us!

60
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,985
Fucking bastards!

61
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,980
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr Kelly, love.

62
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:52,741
Two suspects proceeding
back west...

63
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:54,781
Mr Kelly!

64
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:57,300
Bastards!

65
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,265
We have to move the guns.
You go and move the gear.

66
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,417
Right. Everyone out now!
Come on!

67
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,180
Get out of the fucking way.
The Brits is after us!

68
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,704
The Brits is after us!
The Brits are after us!

69
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,745
- In here, in here!
- Gerry!

70
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,897
Come on, come on.
This way, lads.

71
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,585
Go! Go! Go, go!

72
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,541
Go on, Gerry!

73
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:46,663
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

74
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,337
They're right in front of us, boys.

75
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:56,065
- Who is it?
- It's Conlon.

76
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,216
Grab him!

77
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:18,306
It's your brother!
Your brother Gerry!

78
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,495
Oh, my God!

79
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:40,659
Fucking English bastards!

80
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,415
They've started a riot
to cover the sniper.

81
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,304
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him.

82
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:49,661
Let's go, lads.

83
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,017
Let's go, let's go! Move it!

84
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:00,940
Get that child out of here now!

85
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,098
Move that child!

86
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:15,021
Shoot that fucking gas now!

87
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:25,975
Come and fucking get us now,
you bastards!

88
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,256
Let him go, you bastards!

89
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,224
Fucking bitch!

90
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:54,299
You okay?

91
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,378
- I got a friend wants to talk to you.
- Oh, fuck's sake.

92
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,265
Hey, come on. We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, all right?

93
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,338
Let's be smart. Come on.

94
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:04,986
They're taking
your brother away!

95
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,985
Where are you going now?

96
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,864
- We weren't robbing no houses.
- Don't fuck with me.

97
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,585
Suddenly you're a good boy?

98
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,101
- Have you been robbing houses again?
- We weren't robbing houses.

99
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,496
Search him.
Did you get away all right?

100
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,418
- Aye.
- Who was it?

101
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,145
- It was those two.
- Those two?

102
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:24,503
- That isn't mine. It isn't.
- Peter?

103
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,260
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

104
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:28,496
Fuck you!

105
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,946
Daddy, Daddy,
the IRA has our Gerry.

106
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,778
Go on, show me.

107
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,256
Yo, give him that.

108
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,497
Right, Tommo, lad.

109
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:55,544
Tommo, get their trousers down.
I fucking warned you, Danny.

110
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,743
- Peter, we didn't do nothing, honestly.
- Give you a break?

111
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:00,136
What's she saying?
What are we supposed to have done?

112
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,377
This is what I'm gonna give you.
Now get your trousers down.

113
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,856
You just ran into the house
where we had all that gear.

114
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,507
What was I supposed to know?
I was trying to get away from the Brits.

115
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,339
'Cause you were
stealing lead again, weren't you?

116
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:10,860
You were stealing lead.

117
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,142
- Shut up, Danny!
- They were shooting at us.

118
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,979
- Get the strides down now.
- Why?

119
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,865
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound
and lose your leg, that's why.

120
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:21,063
Come on, Peter. Give us a few slaps.
You don't have to shoot us.

121
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,978
- Fuck's sake.
- Fucking Tarzan.

122
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,785
Look at the balls on him!

123
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:29,896
Jesus! Christ! Peter! Peter!

124
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,501
They're only young.
Give 'em a chance.

125
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,101
We were just trying
to scare some sense into them.

126
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:36,984
He was stealing lead again.

127
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,183
He ran through one of our houses
and started all this shit.

128
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,905
Did you start all this?

129
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:45,785
He'll never survive
in this town. Never.

130
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,744
This is the last time.
You two blow!

131
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,419
And, Danny, it's the last time.

132
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,225
- The same for you, Conlon.
- Pull up your trousers.

133
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,945
Come back here!

134
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,703
- We've never had a thief in our family.
- We've never had nothing in our family.

135
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:01,177
- Will you get a job?
- You know we can't get jobs.

136
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,424
I have a job.

137
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:06,623
Do you want me to work
as a bookie's clerk?

138
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,985
- I want you to have some respect.
- Aye, respect for who?

139
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,620
For yourself.

140
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,136
We're getting you out of here.

141
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:30,138
He'll do no growing up
in England, Giuseppe.

142
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,582
No family life there.

143
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,942
Oh, give over, Ma.

144
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,746
I'm gonna miss the boat.
What's that?

145
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:40,387
- Sausages for your Aunt Annie.
- Jesus Christ, Ma!

146
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,264
- Here you are, son.
- Here, let me do that.

147
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,057
All right, I'm ready.
Where are you going?

148
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,296
I'll walk with you.

149
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,025
Do you not trust me
to get on the boat?

150
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,901
I'm sure I'll be back
when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

151
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,898
Good luck. God bless.

152
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,739
I love you, son.

153
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,102
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Behave yourself, Ann.

154
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,586
Cheerio, Gerry.

155
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,941
Bye, Bridie.

156
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,978
He's gone now forever.

157
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,627
I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

158
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:27,017
Did I ever tell you
the time I jumped ship?

159
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:30,502
Jumped overboard
about 200 yards out to sea...

160
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,737
swam back to this
godforsaken place.

161
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,862
Why did you swim back?

162
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:41,858
There was a woman involved.

163
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:44,900
Oh, aye?

164
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:49,384
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

165
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,818
What was her name?

166
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:04,375
Aye, you know her name.
You know your own mother's name.

167
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,221
Sarah. Sarah Maguire she was.

168
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,105
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

169
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,816
<i>Boarding all passengers.</i>

170
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,705
<i>All second-class passengers
boarding now.</i>

171
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:41,742
Go and live. Go and live, son.

172
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,704
That's the best advice
I can give you.

173
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,623
Remember,
honest money goes further.

174
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,385
<i>Honest money goes further.</i>

175
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,187
<i>A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.</i>

176
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,536
<i>Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.</i>

177
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:03,141
<i>He'd a cliche
for every occasion.</i>

178
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,385
I'll give you a call.

179
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,059
Right, son.

180
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:14,104
<i>I ran up the gangplank
to get away from him...</i>

181
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:16,417
<i>and then I suddenly
felt bad about it.</i>

182
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:18,338
<i>I decided to turn back...</i>

183
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:21,976
<i>to call him Giuseppe
for the first time in my life.</i>

184
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:25,416
<i>When I turned around,
he had already walked away.</i>

185
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,456
<i>- I just called after him.
- Good-bye, Da!</i>

186
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:38,385
<i>Then I met my old schoolmate,
Paul Hill.</i>

187
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:42,221
<i>Little did I know that after meeting him
my life would change forever.</i>

188
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,819
You're under arrest.

189
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,703
Fuck's sake, Gerry!

190
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:58,097
- Still a head case.
- James Bond, license to kill.

191
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,778
Look at you... you're a fucking nervous
wreck. What's the matter with you?

192
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,505
I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

193
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,984
Where're you going?

194
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,865
- I'm going to London. What about you?
- The same.

195
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,983
I need a drink.

196
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:19,503
Aye, I'm skint.
I'll let you buy me one.

197
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:34,140
<i>Once upon a time
you dressed so fine</i>

198
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:36,866
<i>You threw the bums a dime
in your prime</i>

199
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,539
<i>Didn't you</i>

200
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,385
<i>I arrived in London
on the 26th of June.</i>

201
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,061
<i>My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie...</i>

202
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:50,219
<i>but I had an invitation to a hippie
commune from my old friend...</i>

203
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,457
<i>Paddy Armstrong.</i>

204
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,856
Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.

205
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:57,302
- It's only that big on the map.
- But it's a map, Gerry.

206
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,343
London's a big place, you know.

207
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:07,223
<i>What I was really looking for
was free love and dope.</i>

208
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:11,217
I think it's this way.

209
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:28,457
Paddy?

210
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,701
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

211
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:34,176
- Paddy who?
- Paddy from Belfast. Paddy Armstrong.

212
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:41,065
- There's some people here to see you!
- Who is it?

213
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:42,466
Some Irish boys.

214
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,617
Jesus! Gerry Conlon.

215
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:46,265
What about you, Paddy?

216
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,224
Thought you was the drug squad.
Come on in.

217
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,341
There you go.

218
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,144
Welcome to Xanadu.

219
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,101
Hi.

220
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,378
Jesus fucking wept.

221
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,617
Neat, ain't it?

222
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,379
Deptford Jim.

223
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,822
- Paul Hill. Gerry Conlon from home.
- Right.

224
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,818
Before you can enter the circle...

225
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:23,616
you have to have
the rite of passage.

226
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,504
Open your mouth.

227
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,143
I enjoyed that.

228
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,425
They can't stay.

229
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,418
- There's not enough room.
- Jim!

230
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:49,342
Our rule: No property. No law.

231
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:51,383
- Just love.
- All right, let's vote on it.

232
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,741
If you want Gerry and...

233
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,704
- What's your name?
- Paul.

234
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,902
We're gonna call you
"Saddest Moon".

235
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,217
- Fuck off.
- Right?

236
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:06,946
If you want Gerry and Saddest Moon
to stay, raise your hands.

237
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,063
Four, five, six...

238
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:12,502
- Put your hand up, Paddy.
- Right.

239
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:15,021
- Eight.
- Looks like we're staying then.

240
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,580
What shall we call you then?

241
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,701
You can call me "Wild One."

242
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,301
Here, hold on. Come here.

243
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,059
Get off, all right?

244
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:34,138
What's the fucking problem?

245
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:37,703
They have dead pig in here.

246
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,066
Just some sausages.

247
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:42,297
We're all vegetarians here.

248
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,537
I am a vegetarian.
We're both vegetarians.

249
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:47,061
I was just taking them sausages
to me Auntie Annie's.

250
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:50,696
I have to be around there now. I'll be
back in a few minutes, all right?

251
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,345
Be back in a few minutes.

252
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:56,415
Piggy.

253
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,099
And Porky.

254
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,221
Is she related to the
Royal Family or something?

255
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,218
Aye, she's fifth in line
to the throne.

256
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:14,383
Ferguson's sausages... only good thing
that came out of that godforsaken place.

257
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,059
- Would you like some more?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

258
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,264
- We better make tracks.
- Won't you stay? I've the bed made up.

259
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,781
You're very kind, but we need
a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

260
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,778
We're forming a band
and that there.

261
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,062
Aye. A rock band.

262
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,895
Where are you staying?

263
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,546
The address, you mean?

264
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,776
- Fillmore.
- Fillimore.

265
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,257
Fillimore Road.
It's number 60...

266
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:44,657
something...
the number dropped off the door.

267
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,307
What do you mean,
the number dropped off the door?

268
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:53,501
Well, would you let me have it
when you find out what it is?

269
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:56,420
- Aye.
- And would you phone your mother?

270
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:59,146
Aye. There's only one problem.

271
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,419
It doesn't have a phone.

272
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,784
Hello, Marian. Any problems?

273
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,664
- Is it all there?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,737
Okay. We're in business.

275
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,500
Watch the cracks.
Watch the cracks.

276
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,340
It's not fair.
Their skirts are covering the cracks.

277
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,099
He's cheating!

278
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:25,467
- I'm a referee!
- He's cheating.

279
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,423
- That wasn't too far away, was it?
- Is that a bomb, Paddy?

280
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,498
It's getting more like home.

281
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,380
Hello? Hold on, hold on.

282
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:23,822
Giuseppe. Giuseppe.
Long-distance call.

283
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,818
- What?
- Long-distance call.

284
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,146
- Go ahead.
- Hello?

285
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,104
- Ask him for the money.
- Hey, Da.

286
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,825
<i>- It's Gerry speaking.
- Son.</i>

287
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,898
<i>- Hi. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?</i>

288
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:38,103
It's been six weeks
since you've been in touch.

289
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,223
<i>I know. Sorry about that.
I've been a bit busy.</i>

290
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:43,663
It's just your ma's a bit worried,
you know. You still going to Mass?

291
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,739
<i>- Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork.
- Good.</i>

292
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:50,502
<i>- Are you working?
- I have a couple of things going here.</i>

293
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:52,179
Good. And are you safe?

294
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:55,100
<i>- How do you mean?
- From all the bombs.</i>

295
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,940
Aye, you could just hear them
in the distance like, but...

296
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:00,780
Sorry about that.

297
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,142
<i>- Are you stuck?
- How do you mean, Da?</i>

298
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,706
Are you short of cash?

299
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,347
No. No, I'm flush
at the moment.

300
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:09,941
No problem.
No, I have plenty of money.

301
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:12,302
All right.
And, Gerry, keep in touch.

302
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,697
<i>- Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.
- All right, son. I'll tell your ma...</i>

303
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,059
Bye.

304
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,739
Sorry about that.

305
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,295
We've enough for chips.

306
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:30,463
Sorry, we'd only
enough money for two chips.

307
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,060
Are you all right?

308
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:33,865
What?

309
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,827
There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

310
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,904
There they are. It's the Irish.

311
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,818
Bringing all their troubles
over here again.

312
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:45,537
Aye, it's all right when it happens
over in Belfast. You fucking prick!

313
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:49,302
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

314
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:52,982
- You stupid fucking prick!
- Go home! Fuck you!

315
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,217
I don't fucking believe this.
I'm getting out of here.

316
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,616
- Are you coming, Paddy?
- Where are you gonna sleep?

317
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,460
No problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

318
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,187
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Take care.

319
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:07,946
- Mind your fucking manners!
- Prick.

320
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,383
<i>Troops have entered
the Ardoyne area of West Belfast...</i>

321
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:14,982
<i>since the collapse of the provisional
IRA cease-fire over the weekend.</i>

322
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,217
Yeah, I'm watching it.

323
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:21,983
<i>Civilians have been evacuated, and there
are reports of casualties in many areas.</i>

324
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:24,865
<i>- Both sides are blaming each other...
- Okay, I'll take care of it.</i>

325
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,898
That's it. 8:00 tonight.

326
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,020
No warning.

327
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,901
That's my place.
Youse are sitting there too long.

328
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,663
CB... Charlie Burke. That's me.

329
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,500
I carved my initials
with this penknife.

330
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:55,102
No problem, Charlie.
No problem. Whatever you say.

331
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:58,384
Closing the park.
Park closing now.

332
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,981
- Easy with the feet there, Charlie.
- It's a big bench, you know?

333
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,183
There's room for three of us here.

334
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,338
You're Irish too, aren't you?

335
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:11,539
I come over here
when I was about your age.

336
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:14,061
Did you ever think
of going home, Charlie?

337
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:16,217
Shit.

338
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,060
There's nothing for me
over there now.

339
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:26,384
- Closing the park!
- Could you lend us a few shillings?

340
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,264
I was gonna ask you the same.

341
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,742
- Gerry, we've no money left.
- It's all I have.

342
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,660
Well, now, like I wouldn't like
to take all your money.

343
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:43,738
No problem.
Catch you again, Charlie.

344
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:47,103
- Come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.
- All right, all right.

345
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:02,219
<i>We must'vejust said good night
to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.</i>

346
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,936
<i>All we were concerned about was
where we were gonna sleep that night.</i>

347
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,018
<i>We'd no money in our pockets.</i>

348
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:11,179
<i>We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford
even if we'd known where it was.</i>

349
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:16,265
No fucking way I'm going
back to Belfast.

350
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:17,939
I tell you that.

351
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:24,100
- Hey, blondie.
- Hey, sexy.

352
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,257
- You dropped something.
- Back off, paddy.

353
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:28,224
She's outta your league.

354
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:29,581
Here.

355
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,935
It's her fucking keys.
I'm going in.

356
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:42,700
We should give 'em back, Gerry.
Put 'em through the letter box.

357
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:44,982
Put the keys back
in the letter box, Gerry.

358
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,698
Jesus Christ,
how much money is there?

359
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:48,538
<i>I got £700 from
the hooker's apartment.</i>

360
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,266
<i>I did feel a little bit
guilty about that.</i>

361
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:55,346
<i>We spent that night in a hotel.</i>

362
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:59,579
<i>The next day we went and bought
the same clothes... the same trousers...</i>

363
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:02,306
<i>samejackets,
even the same shoes.</i>

364
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,827
Hey, mister,
has your coat got fleas?

365
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:44,216
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

366
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:50,542
- Did you miss me, Bridie?
- Look at Gerry. He's a hippie!

367
00:26:50,627 --> 00:26:51,696
Daddy, look at the money!

368
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,743
- Do you want it?
- Oh, my God!

369
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,863
Do you wanna be in my gang?

370
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,223
Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang.
I wanna be in your gang.

371
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,377
- Over here.
- Take it easy.

372
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:04,982
Steady. Calm it down.
Just calm it down.

373
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,786
It's my money! It's mine!

374
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,619
Calm it down. Stop it.

375
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,379
- It's my money! He gave it to me!
- Stop that!

376
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,786
Stop that!

377
00:27:18,307 --> 00:27:20,901
And they were always talking about
the troubles, were they?

378
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,020
Yeah. Especially Paul Hill.

379
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:29,066
He was always talking about Belfast,
the IRA, all that stuff.

380
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,867
Look, all I'm saying is this:

381
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:37,656
They had a lot of money,
and Conlon went back to Belfast.

382
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:40,341
- Come along, into the car.
- What the fuck is going on?

383
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:44,458
That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.

384
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,822
- Aye.
- Did it hurt you, Danny?

385
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:50,217
It wasn't too bad. The bullet bounced
off the kneecap and out the other side.

386
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:51,740
<i>Five people are dead...</i>

387
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:55,137
<i>and 75 seriously injured
as a result of the IRA 's...</i>

388
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:58,742
<i>no-warning bomb attack
on a Guildford pub.</i>

389
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:02,217
<i>Parliament has passed
the Prevention of Terrorism Act...</i>

390
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:05,902
<i>which allows terrorist suspects to be
held by police for up to seven days.</i>

391
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:08,660
Seven days. Geez.

392
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,625
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

393
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:15,825
<i>Around London
and arrested 19 suspects.</i>

394
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,023
Gerry, there's your shoes.

395
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:20,667
<i>Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert
Dixon of the antiterrorist squad...</i>

396
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:22,465
<i>about those arrests.</i>

397
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,822
<i>We can't pretend
people won't be inconvenienced.</i>

398
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:26,784
<i>Some of them may not deserve it.</i>

399
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:30,416
<i>That's why we shall use these powers
as selectively as possible.</i>

400
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,627
Get up out of bed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!

401
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:41,981
Hands above your head!

402
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:45,903
I don't know what the fuck youse are
looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

403
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:49,502
Gerry, your coat.
He's done nothing.

404
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:50,987
- Inside, sir.
- He's not political.

405
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,864
I have a right to speak to my son.

406
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,341
Keep calm, Gerry.

407
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,015
Get back in. Get back inside.

408
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:06,425
It's all right. It's all right.

409
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,535
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out soon enough.

410
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:29,422
- Where'd he get this money?
- I don't know.

411
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,140
They have no right
to take him to England.

412
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:38,379
Slow down a bit.

413
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,980
Look, I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about.

414
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,823
I've done nothing wrong.

415
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:59,663
When can I go back to Belfast?

416
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:02,545
Next time you see Belfast, they'll be
flying day trips to the moon.

417
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:05,462
I always wanted
to be an astronaut.

418
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,578
What are you charging me with?

419
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,340
You're being held
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

420
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:22,496
What?

421
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:26,182
We can hold you for seven days
and seven nights without charging you.

422
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,657
- When was I a fucking terrorist?
- Were you part of that, Gerry?

423
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:34,859
And that. You proud of that?

424
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:39,179
- And that.
- Why are you showing me these people?

425
00:31:40,987 --> 00:31:43,706
No marks!
Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

426
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:45,379
Are you fucking proud of that?

427
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:49,579
Look at that young,
pretty girl there!

428
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:52,977
- Now look at her!
- You're out of your fucking minds!

429
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,864
- Do you?
- You're out of your fucking minds!

430
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:59,667
The children know there's
something terrible going on.

431
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:03,586
- And you're not making it easier.
- I haven't the strength for this.

432
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,658
If he killed innocent people,
I haven't the strength for it.

433
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,022
Listen, I know that child.
I carried that child.

434
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,098
If you're not gonna
believe in him, I will.

435
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:12,939
You think he's innocent?

436
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,382
When your son walked through that door
looking like a bloody circus clown...

437
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,423
do you think he had murder
in his eyes?

438
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,423
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

439
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:23,624
- It's a surprise.
- Shut up. Shut up!

440
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:40,337
When will Daddy be back?

441
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:42,383
He'll be back
in a couple of days.

442
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:46,098
Why did they put Gerry in jail?

443
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:47,779
It's a mistake.

444
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:51,946
I'm on my way over
to bring him back home.

445
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:54,222
Why are you getting
narky again?

446
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,738
Are we touching a sore spot?

447
00:32:57,827 --> 00:33:00,068
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England.

448
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:02,825
I told you about 100 times.

449
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:04,181
Then tell us again!

450
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:10,786
I stayed at the squat
most of the time.

451
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,664
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's...

452
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:15,261
and one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

453
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:33,467
Male. Late forties.

454
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:35,936
Who taught you
how to make the bomb, Gerry?

455
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:39,302
I never made any bombs.

456
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:40,945
Did Annie make the bomb, Gerry?

457
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:45,026
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

458
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,381
Is Annie Marian?

459
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:52,461
- Annie who?
- Annie Maguire!

460
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:55,505
My Aunt Annie?

461
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:58,545
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

462
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:00,822
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

463
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:02,977
Are you Marian?

464
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,702
What?

465
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,015
Are you Marian?

466
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:13,702
She had nothing to do with it.

467
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:20,420
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

468
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,418
He says I done Guildford.

469
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:27,261
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

470
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:30,896
Show me what you want me to sign.
I have an alibi for that night.

471
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,747
What are you showing me
these for?

472
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:43,339
Gerry told us you did it.

473
00:34:43,427 --> 00:34:45,338
Then he's a fucking liar.

474
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:49,705
Armstrong drove the car.
Who was the woman in the back?

475
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,504
I don't know.

476
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:57,738
But you were
in the Ford Cortina.

477
00:34:57,827 --> 00:35:00,705
But you were
in the red Ford Cortina.

478
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,948
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

479
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:08,497
I told you I was in the Cortina.
I told you it was a taxi.

480
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:10,862
No. The taxi was
a Toyota Corolla.

481
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:13,222
When can I ring home?

482
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:17,744
- Let's start again. Who's Marian?
- Was it someone Irish?

483
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:21,422
Why are you getting narky again?
Touching a sore spot? What was her name?

484
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:25,056
- Nothing to do with what, Gerry?
- Talk to me.

485
00:35:25,147 --> 00:35:26,705
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

486
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:31,303
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?"

487
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:33,378
Who taught you how
to make the bomb, Gerry?

488
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:38,941
Talk to me.

489
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:47,458
He'll do what he's told.

490
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,578
Look at him.
He's a lying bastard.

491
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:53,386
He's a right fucking comedian.
Aren't you, Gerry?

492
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,856
- Who's Marian?
- I don't know what...

493
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:59,064
I'm getting fucking bored with this.
Who is Marian?

494
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:03,220
I'm gonna keep on asking until
you give me a fucking answer!

495
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:04,786
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know!

496
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,506
Yes, you fucking do!
Bollocks! Who is Marian?

497
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,299
We know who Marian is.

498
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:27,501
- Are you the man in charge?
- Yes, I am.

499
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:30,340
For fuck's sake,
tell 'em to stop hurting me.

500
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:36,738
I swear to God...

501
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,705
I know where I was
at the time of the bombings.

502
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:47,859
I was with a madman
called Charlie Burke.

503
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,619
Have you any other alibis?

504
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:53,938
I have told youse before...

505
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:56,541
I was with Paul Hill
most of the day.

506
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,817
Tell Gerry Conlon
like you said you would.

507
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:17,341
- Who's this?
- Gerry Conlon.

508
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,939
Have you anything
to say to him?

509
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,465
I've cleared my conscience.

510
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,697
I advise you to do the same.

511
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:46,779
There's your statement.

512
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,218
I didn't do this.

513
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:54,901
I didn't fucking do this!

514
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:02,426
Please believe me.

515
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:05,624
What are you doing to me?

516
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:13,137
They wouldn't hold him
if he hadn't done something.

517
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:17,458
- Gerry is no angel.
- I know that.

518
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,458
He needs a strong hand.

519
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:26,899
You're all under arrest.

520
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:29,421
- No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child!
- Put your hands up!

521
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,624
You're all being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

522
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:43,939
- Is Hill leading us up the garden path?
- I don't know.

523
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:52,217
I can make him confess.

524
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,059
Why don't you have
a word in his ear?

525
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:56,980
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

526
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,978
Will you have the bomber?

527
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,217
Our job is to stop the bombing.

528
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,743
I'm gonna shoot your da.

529
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:10,302
What did you say to me?

530
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:15,666
Little Bridie'll have no daddy.

531
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,897
I'm gonna shoot Giuseppe.

532
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:29,898
He's threatening to shoot my da!

533
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,899
He's threatening to kill my da!

534
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,705
Look at him! Look at him!

535
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:37,745
He's a madman!

536
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:41,615
I think you're hallucinating.
Nobody's gonna harm your father.

537
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:45,901
Get him back. Get him back.

538
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,865
He threatened to kill my da.

539
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,903
Nobody's gonna kill your father.

540
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:54,945
- You mad bastard!
- Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

541
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,538
He's not gonna harm your father.

542
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:02,581
Come on, let it all out.

543
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,578
Let it all out...
all that hatred.

544
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:11,257
You hate us, don't you?

545
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:13,941
You hate us enough
to bomb and maim.

546
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:17,144
That is the trouble.
You let it all out. Come on.

547
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,139
- I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.

548
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,617
I can see it in your face.
I can see all that hatred.

549
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:26,175
So why don't you just
let it off your chest...

550
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,701
before it starts to mess up
with your mind?

551
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,744
Give me the fucking statement.

552
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,945
For fuck's sake,
give me the statement.

553
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:44,900
Give me a fucking pen.

554
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:56,538
Right, that's my fucking name there.
You can write what you like.

555
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:01,020
All right, nice and easy.
Come on.

556
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:04,656
- Paul! What's going on?
- Gerry!

557
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:07,261
They stuck a fucking gun
in my mouth!

558
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:09,065
So I told 'em
a lot of bullshit!

559
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:12,219
- Why did you give 'em my fucking name?
- I'm sorry!

560
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:16,744
It's fucking mad!
It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

561
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,182
It'll be laughed
out of fucking court!

562
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,986
<i>The four of us were split up.</i>

563
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:24,820
<i>I was taken to
South London Remand Centre.</i>

564
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:27,421
<i>You can check the dates, Gareth.</i>

565
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,664
Kill that fucker!

566
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:43,106
You fucking son
of an Irish cow!

567
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,105
Kick that Irish fucking ass!

568
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:52,138
- What is that?
- Delousing.

569
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:53,984
I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.

570
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:55,978
You have no choice, mate.

571
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:58,456
You'll never clean the scum
off that...

572
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,698
Okay, Conlon.
Go see the room, shall we?

573
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:08,943
Come on, Mr Conlon.

574
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:16,138
We got your son.

575
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,466
Let's go.

576
00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:24,146
Da!

577
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:25,899
Is that you, son?

578
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:30,663
- Da, here!
- Where are you?

579
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:36,701
Don't harm my father.
Don't harm my father!

580
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:38,467
- Are you all right, son?
- Don't kill him!

581
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,146
Come on, move along.
Move along. Come on, you.

582
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:49,820
- Fuck you!
- Shut up, you!

583
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:53,183
- Shut up!
- On the floor!

584
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:57,142
You look fucking brave now.

585
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:07,146
What the fuck
are you doing here, Da?

586
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,457
I come over to your Aunt Annie's
to get you a lawyer.

587
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,146
They arrested everybody
in the house.

588
00:44:12,147 --> 00:44:14,146
What?

589
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:17,146
- What for, fuck's sake?
- Conspiracy to murder.

590
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:19,536
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck's sake, no. Geez.

591
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:28,896
Did you do it?
Did you do it, son?

592
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:30,500
No, I did not!

593
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:37,945
Of course I fucking
didn't do it, fuck's sake!

594
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:51,136
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What?

595
00:44:55,507 --> 00:44:57,782
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

596
00:44:57,867 --> 00:44:59,823
Why do you always follow me?

597
00:45:02,907 --> 00:45:05,819
Why do you always follow me
when I do something wrong?

598
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:08,660
Why can't you follow me
when I do something right?

599
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,136
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

600
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:13,695
- I'm talking about the medal.
- What medal?

601
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:16,506
What fucking medal?
What fucking medal?

602
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:20,865
The only fucking medal that was ever
in our house. That fucking medal.

603
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:23,666
The medal I won at football.

604
00:45:23,747 --> 00:45:26,102
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions...

605
00:45:26,147 --> 00:45:27,580
like you could only see
what I was doing...

606
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:30,146
you couldn't even
fucking play football...

607
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,866
and you could only see
what I was doing wrong.

608
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:35,017
I could never do anything
good enough for you.

609
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,905
And after the game,
you came up to me and said...

610
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:41,024
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

611
00:45:41,107 --> 00:45:44,543
And I walked away from you, remember?
I walked away into the dressing room.

612
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:47,903
You followed me in there and said again,
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

613
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:50,217
All the other fathers were in there
laughing at you...

614
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:52,146
calling you "Poor Giuseppe."

615
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:55,856
And I ran out, and I hid,
and I wrote your name on the ground...

616
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:57,539
your stupid Giuseppe fucking name...

617
00:45:57,627 --> 00:46:00,061
I wrote it in the dirt,
and I fucking pissed on it!

618
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:04,146
I pissed on it...

619
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:06,866
because I did foul the ball.

620
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:10,860
What did it matter? We won.
For once in our lives, we won.

621
00:46:10,947 --> 00:46:13,825
You ruined that medal for me! I took it
to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

622
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:16,467
- They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.
- This is shock.

623
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:20,825
And that's when I started to rob,
to prove that I was no good.

624
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:23,146
- Delayed shock.
- Never mind delayed shock.

625
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,139
I've been like this
since I was seven.

626
00:46:26,187 --> 00:46:28,940
I remember Mammy said to me,
"Don't upset Giuseppe. He's not well."

627
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:32,146
Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

628
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:36,538
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.
"Not well, you know. He's not well."

629
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,146
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

630
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:42,025
Is it my fault you weren't well?

631
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:44,746
Why did you have to be sick
all your life, Giuseppe?

632
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:46,943
What'd you have to be sick
all your life for?

633
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:50,576
When that mad bastard out there
threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

634
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,737
I swear to God.
Honest to God, I was happy.

635
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,500
I was delighted! You know why?
Because finally it was all over.

636
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:58,704
It was over! You see?

637
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:01,062
And then I knew I was bad.

638
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:04,025
I knew I was bad then, you see,
so I started to cry.

639
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:06,146
I started to tell lies...
the same fucking lies...

640
00:47:06,147 --> 00:47:09,139
I've been telling
all my gobshite fucking life.

641
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:18,146
- That means words don't mean nothing.
- Stop this.

642
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:20,820
Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

643
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:23,865
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
no good anyhow. It doesn't matter.

644
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:26,620
Keep away from me. You've been
following me all your life.

645
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:30,905
- Are you here deliberately?
- No. Stop it.

646
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:33,899
You call that a fucking dig?

647
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:38,105
Do you call that a fucking dig?
Hit me harder. Hit me fucking harder!

648
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,138
- Stop it. Calm down.
- For once in your fucking life!

649
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:42,457
- Hit me like a real father!
- Just calm down. Stop it.

650
00:47:51,027 --> 00:47:52,983
Just relax.

651
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:56,145
Try to relax.

652
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:05,815
It's okay.

653
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,865
It's not your fault,
son, all right?

654
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:15,984
Everything's gonna be
all right.

655
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:18,865
Okay. All right, son.

656
00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:22,703
Visitor for Conlon!

657
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:27,103
Two on for visit!

658
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:37,898
No touching.

659
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:42,503
- Everybody else was allowed to touch.
- IRA, closed visits. No contact.

660
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:55,663
Why are you doing this to us?

661
00:48:57,907 --> 00:49:00,705
You have your father
locked up in prison for murder.

662
00:49:00,787 --> 00:49:02,186
Speak up, please.

663
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:06,506
- It's not my fault, Ma.
- Take it easy, Sarah.

664
00:49:10,787 --> 00:49:13,779
I swear to God,
I've done nothing wrong.

665
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,142
Why did you sign
a confession, son?

666
00:49:16,227 --> 00:49:19,025
He did it to protect me, love.

667
00:49:19,107 --> 00:49:21,985
You have a good son there.
That's all you need to know.

668
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:24,979
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Giuseppe?

669
00:49:25,067 --> 00:49:28,025
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

670
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:31,816
Look, they've no statement
nor evidence against me.

671
00:49:31,907 --> 00:49:36,139
I'll be out and home soon.
Sure I'm only visiting here myself.

672
00:49:37,587 --> 00:49:39,737
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

673
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:44,464
Danny's dead, Gerry.

674
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:46,856
What?

675
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:52,139
They found his body
on waste ground.

676
00:49:52,227 --> 00:49:55,219
The IRA said he was
an incurable thief.

677
00:49:58,227 --> 00:50:01,583
I sent a Mass card
from the family.

678
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:08,024
This one'll not go to school
since you've been away.

679
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:09,904
Hey, you go to school
for your mammy.

680
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:11,659
Yes, Daddy.

681
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,136
Daddy, when will you be home?

682
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,457
I've pressed your Sunday suits
for the trial.

683
00:50:20,547 --> 00:50:22,742
You make sure
and look your best now, son.

684
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,776
But is there nitro
or was there not nitro?

685
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,939
Yes, there are traces of nitro.

686
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:34,143
But are they all positive?

687
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:37,623
Well, yes, on six of them.

688
00:50:37,707 --> 00:50:41,746
- Who'd we miss?
- The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

689
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:44,466
But her rubber glove
showed a faint trace.

690
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,145
And the children?

691
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:49,580
Positive.

692
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:54,460
The results may not
be good enough for court.

693
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:57,823
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

694
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:01,506
Yes, sir.

695
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,056
Kill the bastards! Kill 'em!

696
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,739
Shoot the bastards!

697
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,142
Call number one.

698
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,777
- Let's go.
- Jesus, it's a nightmare, Giuseppe.

699
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:41,701
Just stay calm, be on your best
behavior, and this'll be behind us soon.

700
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,025
That's it, come on.

701
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:50,739
It'll be all right.

702
00:52:00,587 --> 00:52:03,101
<i>All rise.</i>

703
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:26,144
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the Crown.

704
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:34,541
There are two series of charges here,
ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:37,937
The four defendants in front...

706
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:43,021
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub...

707
00:52:43,107 --> 00:52:45,177
and the murders of five people.

708
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,459
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

709
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:50,697
The seven defendants behind...

710
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:55,178
are charged with the possession
of explosives, not charged with murder.

711
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,776
The Crown's case
against them is...

712
00:52:57,867 --> 00:53:01,064
that they are a support network
for the bombers, and as such...

713
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:05,140
- should be considered independent.
- Control yourself. Pay attention.

714
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:09,624
My first witness is
Inspector Robert Dixon.

715
00:53:09,707 --> 00:53:13,146
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give shall be the truth...

716
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:15,138
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

717
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:22,626
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

718
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:29,016
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson...

719
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:30,984
confessed to the bombing.

720
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,739
They are the IRA's ASU.

721
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:35,500
Can you explain ASUs for us?

722
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,499
Active Service Unit.
They are the elite of the IRA...

723
00:53:38,587 --> 00:53:40,498
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings.

724
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:44,500
Often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers...

725
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:46,737
and planting explosives.

726
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:49,819
And the others...
Annie Maguire and her family?

727
00:53:49,907 --> 00:53:52,057
They are the IRA's support network.

728
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:57,016
Their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives...

729
00:53:57,107 --> 00:54:00,782
and they provide
what we call "safe houses."

730
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,142
Thank you, Inspector.

731
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:07,137
These people were arrested
two days...

732
00:54:07,187 --> 00:54:10,145
after the Prevention
of Terrorism Act was introduced.

733
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:12,138
That's correct.

734
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:15,179
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

735
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:18,146
It permits us to hold
suspected terrorists...

736
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:20,900
for a period of up to seven days.

737
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:23,057
Quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy.

738
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:26,105
Quite difficult, I would think for
the police to resist the temptation...

739
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:28,502
- to deal forcibly with people.
- Objection.

740
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:32,146
People they suspect of the biggest
bombing campaign on British mainland...

741
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:35,139
- since the Second World War.
- Objection. My lord, I really must...

742
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:38,862
- Get to the point!
- Now, this bombing campaign...

743
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:42,781
struck deep into the British people's
sense of security.

744
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:46,064
The people looked to you,
Inspector, to find those responsible.

745
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:47,136
Yes.

746
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:50,103
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

747
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:52,138
That's my job.

748
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:55,145
Now, all of the defendants claim...

749
00:54:55,227 --> 00:54:58,981
including young Patrick Maguire,
aged just 14...

750
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,058
Patrick,
would you stand up, please?

751
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:05,615
Thank you.
All of the defendants claim...

752
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:09,746
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody.

753
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,056
They were never harmed
in any way.

754
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:16,786
He's fucking lying!
They beat the shite out of us!

755
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:20,136
Silence!

756
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,982
Please believe us!
They beat us!

757
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:27,106
Just be quiet.

758
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:29,146
Sit them down!

759
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:31,103
Silence in the court!

760
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:36,217
Mr Conlon says...

761
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:39,943
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

762
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:42,666
I never even spoke to Mr Conlon.

763
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:44,738
I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

764
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:46,545
Silence!

765
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:50,779
Mr Hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth.

766
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,456
There was no pressure of any kind.

767
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:57,220
You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!

768
00:55:57,507 --> 00:55:58,735
Order! Order in court!

769
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:02,183
Inspector, in the case
of the four main defendants...

770
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,583
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind.

771
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:08,023
I have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists. What more do you want?

772
00:56:08,107 --> 00:56:11,702
Well, nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance.

773
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:13,823
It's when the substance
to be tested...

774
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:16,467
<i>After a few weeks,
we were bored out of our minds...</i>

775
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:18,458
<i>just messed around
and that there.</i>

776
00:56:19,987 --> 00:56:22,626
<i>They must've been
desperate for evidence.</i>

777
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:27,019
<i>They produced Annie's washing-up gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.</i>

778
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:29,985
<i>Then it was my turn
to take the stand.</i>

779
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:33,104
Mr Conlon,
did you bomb Guildford?

780
00:56:34,147 --> 00:56:36,103
No, I didn't.

781
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:38,987
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night of the bombing.

782
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,864
Can you tell us where you were?

783
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:43,939
I was in a park in London
at that time.

784
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:46,825
- Who with?
- With Paul Hill sitting there.

785
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,456
You met somebody else that night,
about 8:00 p.m.

786
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:55,146
- Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.
- And who is he?

787
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:59,504
He was just a fellow,
a homeless guy that we met in the park.

788
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:01,817
Why do you remember
this man so clearly?

789
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:06,855
I was thinking that if I didn't get out
of London fast, I would end up like him.

790
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:10,146
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

791
00:57:10,147 --> 00:57:13,184
- What did they say?
- They said he didn't exist.

792
00:57:13,467 --> 00:57:17,904
Mr Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

793
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:22,146
They beat me...

794
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,058
and then they threatened
to kill my father.

795
00:57:24,147 --> 00:57:28,823
- Will you repeat that please?
- They terrorized me for seven days.

796
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:31,182
After that,
they threatened to kill my father.

797
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:34,027
I'd have fucking signed anything
after that.

798
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:37,581
- Excuse my language.
- Thank you.

799
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:43,536
You expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers...

800
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,858
would risk their career
and their reputation...

801
00:57:46,947 --> 00:57:49,146
by threatening your father?

802
00:57:49,147 --> 00:57:51,707
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them...

803
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:53,823
but it happens to be truth.

804
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:56,137
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr Conlon?

805
00:57:57,147 --> 00:57:58,739
I like to think so.

806
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:03,059
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

807
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:05,779
Aye.

808
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:09,621
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

809
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,586
Let me refresh your memory.
You told Inspector Dixon...

810
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:16,181
that you had committed
a robbery on that night.

811
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:18,537
Now do you remember?

812
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:23,026
Aye.

813
00:58:23,107 --> 00:58:27,817
- Who did you rob?
- Robbed a hooker.

814
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:31,138
- You robbed a prostitute?
- Aye.

815
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:35,180
And we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute...

816
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:39,146
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath...

817
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:40,944
and called you a liar?

818
00:58:41,027 --> 00:58:44,736
That was the truth.

819
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:48,146
I'm bound to say I don't find
you very convincing.

820
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:50,138
Thank you, Mr Conlon.

821
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:57,903
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd stole from that woman?

822
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:02,143
You should've called me.
I would've sent the money.

823
00:59:09,507 --> 00:59:12,624
Are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life?

824
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:19,140
Standing up in that witness box,
making faces to your mates.

825
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:34,863
At least you told the truth
in there. That'll stand you.

826
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:43,143
Are you not going
to eat that sausage?

827
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,501
They put a gun in my mouth...

828
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,978
and made me confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

829
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:57,706
So I said I did the big bombing...

830
00:59:57,787 --> 01:00:01,146
and named anybody I knew
who was not in the IRA.

831
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:03,146
Not in the IRA?

832
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:06,139
- Definitely not in the IRA.
- Why?

833
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:09,140
You know why.

834
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:16,900
I just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was.

835
01:00:16,987 --> 01:00:20,866
Inspector, the defendant Conlon
presented an alibi...

836
01:00:20,947 --> 01:00:23,146
One Charlie Burke.

837
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:26,617
That name did appear in Mr Conlon's
statement. We investigated it.

838
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,505
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

839
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:32,021
And there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

840
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:35,144
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

841
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:38,617
At the start of this trial,
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

842
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:43,146
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked
when a fellow attorney came to me...

843
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:45,707
and asked me if I was now
going to wash my hand.

844
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:50,025
In my long legal career,
I cannot remember a case...

845
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:52,143
where emotions have
been so charged.

846
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:55,146
It falls to me now
to appeal to you...

847
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:58,146
the members of the jury,
not to get caught up in this...

848
01:00:58,147 --> 01:01:00,866
tide of mass hysteria.

849
01:01:00,947 --> 01:01:06,146
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

850
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:09,503
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess...

851
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:12,818
through brutality
and intimidation.

852
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:16,146
Now, they may be foolish...

853
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:20,220
petty thieves,
even drug abusers...

854
01:01:20,507 --> 01:01:25,820
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

855
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:30,986
You should find these young people
not guilty.

856
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:34,184
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

857
01:01:34,467 --> 01:01:36,981
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Move it!

858
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:38,944
- Move it!
- Hands off!

859
01:01:45,147 --> 01:01:46,705
Ladies and gentlemen...

860
01:01:48,907 --> 01:01:51,944
like my learned colleague
in the defense...

861
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:55,815
I would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions.

862
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:59,946
The four people
you see in the front...

863
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:03,940
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies...

864
01:02:04,027 --> 01:02:07,146
ever to set foot on English soil.

865
01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:10,776
Now, here are the facts
of this case:

866
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:12,823
Inspector Dixon...

867
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:15,102
a decorated officer
of great expertise...

868
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:18,146
acting on reliable information
and good detective work...

869
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:21,146
arrested Paul Hill...

870
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:25,777
who, guilt-ridden by the shame
of his crime, confessed.

871
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:29,701
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon...

872
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,146
and his terrorist family...

873
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:37,016
his aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker...

874
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:39,780
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives...

875
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:42,779
in the kitchen
of her home in Harlesden.

876
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:45,665
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives...

877
01:02:45,747 --> 01:02:48,819
Vincent, aged 16, Patrick, 14...

878
01:02:48,907 --> 01:02:53,742
who did not... could not...
know any better.

879
01:02:53,827 --> 01:02:55,863
Giuseppe Conlon,
her brother-in-law...

880
01:02:55,947 --> 01:02:58,825
the courier who arrived
with more explosives.

881
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:03,105
Armstrong and his dupe
Richardson, who carried the bomb.

882
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:05,581
Now, these are the people who,
in a panic...

883
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:09,899
had to dispose
of the nitroglycerine...

884
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:12,820
and that is what sealed
their fate.

885
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:17,139
How do we know this?
Because the truth was on their hands.

886
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:25,462
It is a story written
in the blood of their victims.

887
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,505
You have seen some of those
who survived...

888
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:31,659
their callous disregard
for human life.

889
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:36,059
It is now your duty
to protect society from them.

890
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:40,140
I am confident that
that is what you will do.

891
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:18,058
Have you reached a verdict?

892
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:21,020
Yes, we have, my lord.

893
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:26,616
- How do you find the defendants?
- Guilty as charged.

894
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,938
Hang the Irie bastards!

895
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:36,941
Order! Silence!

896
01:04:38,827 --> 01:04:40,579
String 'em up!

897
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:50,147
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

898
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:53,179
Stand up.

899
01:04:55,787 --> 01:04:59,780
I feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud...

900
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:04,657
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

901
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:08,865
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging...

902
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,496
a sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing...

903
01:05:12,587 --> 01:05:15,181
in this case.

904
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:18,543
I sentence you
to life imprisonment...

905
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:22,058
and I instruct
that you shall serve...

906
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:25,139
a minimum of 30 years.

907
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:28,140
Take him down.

908
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,540
Help me.

909
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:53,137
Paul Michael Hill.

910
01:05:55,907 --> 01:06:00,105
In my view, your crime
is such that...

911
01:06:00,147 --> 01:06:02,502
life shall mean life.

912
01:06:02,587 --> 01:06:06,978
<i>Annie Maguire,
I recommend you serve 14 years!</i>

913
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:09,228
- What have I done, for Christ's sake?
- Take her down!

914
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:13,856
<i>- Giuseppe Conlon, 12 years.
- No, my husband's innocent!</i>

915
01:06:13,947 --> 01:06:15,146
Lord have mercy on you!

916
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:18,139
<i>Patrick Joseph Armstrong,
30 years.</i>

917
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:27,662
Carole Richardson, 30 years.

918
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:27,621
<i>Our case was so insane that if you
made it up, nobody would believe it.</i>

919
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:30,824
<i>Look, Gareth, I know people say
that I'm a compulsive storyteller...</i>

920
01:07:30,907 --> 01:07:33,146
<i>and nobody believed
a word I said in court...</i>

921
01:07:33,147 --> 01:07:36,822
<i>but Charlie Burke did exist... he's not
just a figment of my imagination.</i>

922
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:43,695
Sorry.

923
01:07:55,787 --> 01:07:58,146
<i>We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison...</i>

924
01:07:58,147 --> 01:08:02,663
<i>an old Victorian fortress where the
most dangerous criminals were held...</i>

925
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:05,146
<i>in the maximum-security wing.</i>

926
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,138
- Place of birth.
- Belfast.

927
01:08:07,187 --> 01:08:08,905
Then you're British.

928
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:10,146
This is your home
for the rest of your life.

929
01:08:10,147 --> 01:08:12,786
So accept it and get on with it.
Right, come this way.

930
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:14,141
<i>The chief warder, Barker...</i>

931
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:17,583
<i>gave us blue denim uniforms
with yellow stripes.</i>

932
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,225
<i>We were Category A...</i>

933
01:08:19,507 --> 01:08:22,704
<i>the highest-security class along
with the rapists and murderers.</i>

934
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:25,142
<i>My father said
we'd fight for an appeal...</i>

935
01:08:25,187 --> 01:08:27,223
<i>but I didn't want to know
about the legal system.</i>

936
01:08:28,827 --> 01:08:30,943
- I'm going back to the cell.
- Come on. Follow me.

937
01:08:42,147 --> 01:08:43,216
Come on, Gerry.

938
01:08:45,147 --> 01:08:48,617
Hey, Ronnie.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.

939
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:51,821
Irish scum.

940
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:54,705
My name's Giuseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man.

941
01:08:54,787 --> 01:08:57,062
So is my son.

942
01:08:57,147 --> 01:08:58,785
We shouldn't even be in here.

943
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:00,937
Get that fucking scum
off my floor.

944
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:06,458
I said, knock it off!

945
01:09:25,147 --> 01:09:28,457
- They must know they've made a mistake.
- No, they don't.

946
01:09:28,547 --> 01:09:32,222
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

947
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:34,225
We have to fight 'em
to get an appeal.

948
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:39,935
- I'll speak to Father Wilson.
- Speak to everybody.

949
01:09:40,027 --> 01:09:42,700
We'll write letters from in here.
Start a campaign.

950
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:45,142
Have they been
treating you all right?

951
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:47,018
Aye, fine. Fine.

952
01:09:47,787 --> 01:09:49,140
Have they, son?

953
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,983
Aye. No problem.

954
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:07,581
<i>Landing officers, exercise.</i>

955
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:12,183
Forgot the dessert spoons.

956
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:15,819
There we go.

957
01:10:26,227 --> 01:10:28,218
These chips are not bad.

958
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:38,178
- Now don't you despair, son.
- Never mind about "don't despair."

959
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:39,866
What?

960
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:42,700
I mean, we're innocent,
we can't even go out of the cell.

961
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:49,096
You're better off being guilty.
At least you get some respect.

962
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:52,741
<i>Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.</i>

963
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:55,022
You can have my chips.

964
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:40,146
Gerry, man.

965
01:11:40,147 --> 01:11:42,183
Problem? You all right?

966
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:47,146
How you like your new home?

967
01:11:47,147 --> 01:11:50,139
Bombing of pillar-box,
Kensington High Street.

968
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:52,146
Bombing of pillar-box,
Talbot Lodge.

969
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,058
Bombing of naval club.

970
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:57,146
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.
Attempted murder of Edward Heath.

971
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:59,661
Murder of Ross McWhirter.

972
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:03,786
Possession of firearms,
Balcombe Street, December 6, 1975.

973
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:05,937
And the Guildford pub bombings.

974
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:10,984
You have innocent people
in jail for that.

975
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:15,140
Take him out.

976
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:40,619
He did it.

977
01:12:40,707 --> 01:12:43,699
Where's all the missing pieces?

978
01:12:47,707 --> 01:12:50,585
We eat it up, man.

979
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:54,097
Before my woman
send it in here, right...

980
01:12:54,147 --> 01:12:56,900
she have it dipped
in liquid acid...

981
01:12:56,987 --> 01:12:59,706
LSD, man.

982
01:12:59,787 --> 01:13:03,143
We've been dropping the British Empire
for the last six months.

983
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:05,787
You want to fly?
Pick a country.

984
01:13:05,867 --> 01:13:09,064
Fuck's sake, don't give me Northern
Ireland. I don't want a bad trip.

985
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:12,184
Try Nepal, man.
Take you to the Himalayas.

986
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:31,780
See the dragon.

987
01:13:57,547 --> 01:14:00,664
<i>Lights out in 15 minutes.
15 minutes.</i>

988
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,015
Are you praying
for the Seventh Cavalry?

989
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:18,146
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

990
01:14:18,147 --> 01:14:21,856
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

991
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:23,744
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

992
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:26,102
now and at the moment of our death.
Amen.

993
01:14:26,147 --> 01:14:28,058
That's not funny, Gerry.

994
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:34,577
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

995
01:14:36,147 --> 01:14:38,138
Blessed art thou among women...

996
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:40,946
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

997
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,978
Holy Mary, mother of God...

998
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:49,457
pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

999
01:14:58,147 --> 01:15:00,138
Are you on drugs?

1000
01:15:12,147 --> 01:15:16,698
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
now when I get out of this place.

1001
01:15:18,187 --> 01:15:20,018
If I get out.

1002
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:27,500
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not talking to you.

1003
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:29,703
Now who's being childish?

1004
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:34,620
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1005
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:38,140
That stuff'll kill you.

1006
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,504
Sure I'm dead anyway.

1007
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:50,504
Look, I'm sorry. I'll not
take it again so long as you live.

1008
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,783
Are you happy now?

1009
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:57,498
No.

1010
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,543
Why not?

1011
01:16:02,507 --> 01:16:04,975
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1012
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,785
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:19,018
All right. I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1014
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:23,018
Now are you happy?

1015
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:26,137
Is that a promise?

1016
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:30,136
Aye.

1017
01:16:31,907 --> 01:16:33,135
Maybe.

1018
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:43,904
Gerry, man,
check out your friend.

1019
01:16:46,107 --> 01:16:48,063
He look like the real thing.

1020
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:52,626
Come on.

1021
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:07,146
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1022
01:17:11,547 --> 01:17:13,503
Let's have a talk.

1023
01:17:16,827 --> 01:17:18,943
We have to eat in the cells.

1024
01:17:20,027 --> 01:17:21,779
See ya later.

1025
01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:26,143
Gerry, come on.

1026
01:17:51,507 --> 01:17:53,737
Morning, paddy.

1027
01:17:58,707 --> 01:17:59,981
Yes!

1028
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:08,941
Come on!

1029
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,141
Yes, man, Gerry!

1030
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:25,901
This one, this one, this one,
14 days solitary! Lock up!

1031
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:28,540
Lock up!

1032
01:18:28,627 --> 01:18:32,063
He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1033
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:43,698
I'm worried about Bridie.

1034
01:18:46,467 --> 01:18:47,695
Why?

1035
01:18:49,187 --> 01:18:51,906
She's dyed her hair blonde.

1036
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:56,139
Well, she's only young.

1037
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,541
She's wearing a dog collar.

1038
01:19:08,587 --> 01:19:11,943
There's a fella chained to it.
He's got one on too.

1039
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:17,498
Well...

1040
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:20,055
as long as she's happy.

1041
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:32,625
Lunch break.

1042
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:37,458
Yes, Gerry, man! That's right!

1043
01:19:37,547 --> 01:19:39,742
Gerry's a bad boy!

1044
01:19:39,827 --> 01:19:42,216
Put the Englishman
under heavy, heavy manners.

1045
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:46,898
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1046
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:50,218
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1047
01:19:50,507 --> 01:19:51,940
Hello, Mr Conlon.

1048
01:19:54,507 --> 01:19:56,498
I'm watching you.

1049
01:20:07,827 --> 01:20:10,057
What is it?

1050
01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:12,900
I'm the one who planted
the Guildford bomb, Mr Conlon.

1051
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,857
Did you tell the police that?

1052
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,984
Yes, I did.

1053
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:26,140
- But we haven't heard a thing.
- See what he has to say, Da.

1054
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:28,621
Go on.

1055
01:20:28,707 --> 01:20:32,859
I told them.
They know the truth.

1056
01:20:32,947 --> 01:20:35,700
They can't afford to face it.

1057
01:20:35,787 --> 01:20:38,984
It's a war.
You're one if its innocent victims.

1058
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,146
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1059
01:20:41,147 --> 01:20:43,217
Don't be sorry for us.

1060
01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:45,782
You should be sorry
for the people you killed.

1061
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:50,584
It was a military target,
a soldier's pub.

1062
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:55,146
They were innocent people,
God's children.

1063
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:59,777
Look, I'll do all I can
to help you while you're in here.

1064
01:20:59,867 --> 01:21:01,141
We don't need your help.

1065
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:05,495
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us alone.

1066
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,220
Whatever you say.

1067
01:21:11,147 --> 01:21:13,138
I'm sorry about that.

1068
01:21:17,107 --> 01:21:19,143
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1069
01:21:19,187 --> 01:21:23,863
What? Manners to him? I don't want
any part of him, or his ways.

1070
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:27,146
At least he fights back, which is
more than you ever did in your life.

1071
01:21:27,147 --> 01:21:29,741
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember Lydon Hill?

1072
01:21:29,827 --> 01:21:32,625
You used to ride me up
on your bike up Lydon Hill.

1073
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:34,707
And then one day
you couldn't make it to the top...

1074
01:21:34,787 --> 01:21:39,146
and I hopped off and looked back,
and your face was all red.

1075
01:21:39,147 --> 01:21:41,183
- Remember that?
- Aye.

1076
01:21:44,147 --> 01:21:46,456
It was working in the paint shed
done that to you.

1077
01:21:46,547 --> 01:21:47,821
What?

1078
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:51,502
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you.

1079
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:54,055
Never mind jumping off the ferry,
swimming back to Mammy.

1080
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:57,662
It was the one job a Catholic can get,
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1081
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:02,867
Go on outside.
Play with your newfound friend.

1082
01:22:02,947 --> 01:22:07,099
All I'm saying is that you've been
a victim. It's time you fought back.

1083
01:22:07,147 --> 01:22:08,899
- Get out of my sight.
- I'm going.

1084
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:15,137
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternative.

1085
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:35,184
- Well, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1086
01:22:36,747 --> 01:22:39,545
- They didn't do it.
- They all did it.

1087
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:45,138
I'm going back to Belfast.

1088
01:22:51,707 --> 01:22:55,541
<i>After the fight, nobody stopped us
going out in the yard to exercise.</i>

1089
01:22:55,627 --> 01:22:58,983
<i>I felt brilliant.
Joe explained things to me.</i>

1090
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:02,059
<i>He explained how the Brits
never left anywhere without a fight...</i>

1091
01:23:02,147 --> 01:23:05,537
<i>how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied...</i>

1092
01:23:05,627 --> 01:23:08,983
<i>how this prison was just
an extension of their system.</i>

1093
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,501
<i>Calling for work on the threes.</i>

1094
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:14,624
<i>We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.</i>

1095
01:23:14,707 --> 01:23:16,146
Mr Smalls.

1096
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:19,146
<i>But to do that,
we had to take care of Ronnie Smalls.</i>

1097
01:23:19,147 --> 01:23:22,139
Can I have a word
about 54 Halsley Road?

1098
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:27,784
Take a walk.

1099
01:23:35,147 --> 01:23:38,856
If anything happens to me
or Gerry...

1100
01:23:39,627 --> 01:23:42,146
or any other Irish prisoner...

1101
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:46,504
we'll have 54 Halsley Road
blown to smithereens...

1102
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:49,465
with your family in it.

1103
01:23:50,787 --> 01:23:53,699
Threaten my family
and I'll cut your fucking head off.

1104
01:23:57,147 --> 01:23:59,058
I don't make threats.

1105
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:03,140
I just carry out orders.
I don't want to hurt your family.

1106
01:24:08,147 --> 01:24:11,139
Your trouble is, Joe,
you want to rule the fucking world.

1107
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:15,060
Paddy's all right.

1108
01:24:26,587 --> 01:24:28,145
<i>Soon, we were all
one happy family.</i>

1109
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:29,979
Again!

1110
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:33,025
<i>Even Kojak was ready to forgive.</i>

1111
01:24:33,107 --> 01:24:36,146
<i>- Live and let live.
- Barker began to panic.</i>

1112
01:24:36,147 --> 01:24:39,059
<i>He told us to take our socks
out of the window.</i>

1113
01:24:39,147 --> 01:24:41,741
<i>He thought we were signalling
to other prisoners.</i>

1114
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:45,058
We're not signalling.
We're drying our socks out.

1115
01:24:45,147 --> 01:24:46,546
- Take the socks out of the window.
- Who says?

1116
01:24:46,627 --> 01:24:47,742
Mr Barker.

1117
01:24:47,827 --> 01:24:51,786
<i>- That was all the excuseJoe needed.
- Give us two minutes.</i>

1118
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:54,176
<i>- Up and away we went.
- Are you with me?</i>

1119
01:24:54,467 --> 01:24:55,900
What's he up to now?

1120
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:02,497
All prison officers
to vacate the wing.

1121
01:25:02,587 --> 01:25:04,782
<i>All officers vacate the wing!</i>

1122
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,498
This'll damage the whole campaign.

1123
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:15,021
Look, you do it your way,
and we'll do it ours, all right?

1124
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:18,861
<i>- You can read our demands.
- Go back to your cells.</i>

1125
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,585
Blankets!

1126
01:25:21,467 --> 01:25:24,937
- For God's sake, put a stop to this.
- You're weakening my position.

1127
01:25:25,027 --> 01:25:26,824
- It will end in violence.
- Good.

1128
01:25:26,907 --> 01:25:29,216
- What's good about it?
- It's all they understand.

1129
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:34,219
<i>Barker refused to negotiate.</i>

1130
01:25:34,507 --> 01:25:36,543
<i>But with the screws gone,
we'd a brief taste of freedom.</i>

1131
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:37,946
Check out Ronnie!

1132
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:42,137
Him swallow half Africa.

1133
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:44,784
I give him about an hour.

1134
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:53,980
<i>We found out later
our protest got on TV.</i>

1135
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,581
<i>And that's when
the riot squad was ordered in.</i>

1136
01:26:11,587 --> 01:26:14,147
<i>We were singled out
as the ringleaders.</i>

1137
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:15,455
Now!

1138
01:26:41,147 --> 01:26:43,536
You just signed
your own death warrant, Barker.

1139
01:26:48,027 --> 01:26:49,176
Are you happy now?

1140
01:26:53,587 --> 01:26:56,055
<i>And then you arrived, Gareth.</i>

1141
01:26:56,147 --> 01:27:00,146
<i>That's the first time I saw you,
under a raining shower of sparks.</i>

1142
01:27:00,147 --> 01:27:04,146
<i>It was the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.</i>

1143
01:27:04,147 --> 01:27:07,503
<i>But to me, you were a lawyer first.
And I hated lawyers.</i>

1144
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:13,059
- Do you have a new isolation...
- Prisoners: Barth, Andrew.

1145
01:27:13,147 --> 01:27:16,146
Bailey, Benjamin.
McAndrew, Joseph.

1146
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:19,059
- Sorry. Can you... I can't hear.
- Conlon, Gerard.

1147
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:22,105
O'Brien, John.

1148
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:25,662
Lynch, Bernard. Crisp, Quincy.

1149
01:27:25,747 --> 01:27:28,136
Lyon, Richard. Burns, Delrow.

1150
01:27:28,227 --> 01:27:32,140
What about Conlon?
Sorry. Giuseppe Conlon.

1151
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:34,582
He's on the third floor.

1152
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:39,024
He has difficulty
getting down the stairs.

1153
01:27:39,107 --> 01:27:42,146
Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.

1154
01:27:42,147 --> 01:27:45,025
- The delegation has seen enough.
- Right-o. Sorry.

1155
01:27:45,107 --> 01:27:48,144
Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just...
Is that all right? Sorry.

1156
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:51,742
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Sorry.

1157
01:27:57,867 --> 01:27:59,346
Sorry, I can't...

1158
01:27:59,427 --> 01:28:01,463
Pulmonary thrombosis.

1159
01:28:01,547 --> 01:28:04,505
- And he's getting proper medication?
- Aye.

1160
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:10,461
Son?

1161
01:28:13,227 --> 01:28:15,218
That's... Is it Gerry?

1162
01:28:15,307 --> 01:28:16,706
That's Gerry.

1163
01:28:16,787 --> 01:28:19,506
He's had a spot of bother
with lawyers in the past.

1164
01:28:23,347 --> 01:28:26,259
He's all yours.
Fifteen minutes.

1165
01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:28,144
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

1166
01:28:35,147 --> 01:28:37,138
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1167
01:28:57,867 --> 01:29:00,540
Why are you giving
my father false hope?

1168
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,299
Sorry?

1169
01:29:02,387 --> 01:29:05,345
He's been up and down
these stairs to see you.

1170
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:07,543
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1171
01:29:07,627 --> 01:29:10,460
I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1172
01:29:10,547 --> 01:29:12,777
Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1173
01:29:12,867 --> 01:29:14,778
You don't know the half of it.

1174
01:29:17,307 --> 01:29:19,218
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1175
01:29:19,307 --> 01:29:22,146
It's not the stairs that
are killing your father.

1176
01:29:22,147 --> 01:29:25,583
- What is it, then?
- It's your lack of faith.

1177
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:28,386
Lack of faith? Faith in what?

1178
01:29:28,467 --> 01:29:30,185
In yourself.

1179
01:29:30,267 --> 01:29:32,861
No, I have faith in myself.

1180
01:29:34,307 --> 01:29:37,936
Gerry Conlon, lifer,
30-year sentence.

1181
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:40,217
And I know how to survive it.

1182
01:29:41,707 --> 01:29:43,140
At what price?

1183
01:29:43,227 --> 01:29:45,582
I'll pay the fucking price.
Don't you worry about it.

1184
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:48,386
The price for what?

1185
01:29:50,147 --> 01:29:53,662
You're very good at the English,
aren't you?

1186
01:29:53,747 --> 01:29:56,466
You see, I don't understand
your language.

1187
01:29:58,467 --> 01:30:02,146
"Justice." "Mercy." "Clemency."

1188
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,776
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1189
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,904
I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1190
01:30:09,147 --> 01:30:13,186
That way I could put my fist in my mouth
and never speak another word of English.

1191
01:30:13,267 --> 01:30:15,827
Do you see what I'm saying?
Mrs Peirce, is it?

1192
01:30:15,907 --> 01:30:18,546
Are you trying to impress me?

1193
01:30:20,387 --> 01:30:21,786
Visit's up.

1194
01:30:21,867 --> 01:30:24,825
Don't give my father
false hope, all right?

1195
01:30:28,267 --> 01:30:30,337
You've got to help him!

1196
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:35,744
<i>In prison, you pray for anything
to break the monotony.</i>

1197
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:38,705
<i>A snowstorm is like
a present from God.</i>

1198
01:30:49,147 --> 01:30:50,944
Prison officers are not to be hit!

1199
01:30:51,867 --> 01:30:53,539
You've asked for it.

1200
01:30:53,627 --> 01:30:55,424
Come along!

1201
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:59,136
<i>After the riot, my father's
health deteriorated badly.</i>

1202
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:02,623
<i>He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.</i>

1203
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:06,336
<i>I waved up to him, but he
was looking at something else.</i>

1204
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:18,825
<i>My da always saw the good
in people.</i>

1205
01:31:18,907 --> 01:31:22,456
<i>He recognized it in you
the minute he saw you, Gareth.</i>

1206
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:26,859
Guv, guv, where you going?
Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1207
01:31:30,307 --> 01:31:31,899
Thank you.

1208
01:31:36,427 --> 01:31:39,146
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Giuseppe.

1209
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,660
What's that?

1210
01:31:46,907 --> 01:31:48,818
How'd you come by that name?

1211
01:31:50,747 --> 01:31:52,544
An Italian ice cream maker.

1212
01:31:52,627 --> 01:31:55,744
Had a shop on the corner
of the street where I was born.

1213
01:31:55,827 --> 01:31:57,943
Giuseppe Fusco.

1214
01:31:58,147 --> 01:32:00,581
My mother fell in love
with the name.

1215
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:02,146
Were they...

1216
01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:05,220
- You know.
- What?

1217
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:08,344
- Lovers.
- Who?

1218
01:32:08,427 --> 01:32:10,224
My mother and the ice cream maker?

1219
01:32:11,267 --> 01:32:12,859
Oh, no, God.

1220
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:15,142
Jesus, no. No, they were not.

1221
01:32:17,187 --> 01:32:19,223
No, she just liked the name.

1222
01:32:19,307 --> 01:32:22,504
But it made my life hell.

1223
01:32:22,587 --> 01:32:26,626
All the other children laughing at you.
You have any kids yourself?

1224
01:32:31,187 --> 01:32:32,461
He's talking to Barker.

1225
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,937
Forget it. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1226
01:32:38,707 --> 01:32:40,186
Two.

1227
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:43,782
Flown the nest now.

1228
01:33:00,507 --> 01:33:02,463
<i>Whether Barker was
responsible or not...</i>

1229
01:33:02,547 --> 01:33:05,664
<i>for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.</i>

1230
01:33:07,267 --> 01:33:09,303
<i>Joe was still at war...</i>

1231
01:33:09,387 --> 01:33:11,821
<i>and to him,
Barker was the enemy.</i>

1232
01:33:13,787 --> 01:33:15,266
Number?

1233
01:33:15,347 --> 01:33:17,144
The name is McAndrew.

1234
01:33:19,147 --> 01:33:21,263
Get out. Get out of the light!

1235
01:33:23,147 --> 01:33:24,705
- Get out of the light.
- Number?

1236
01:33:24,787 --> 01:33:26,505
Name's Gerry Conlon.

1237
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,787
Piss off out of the light.
Get out of the light!

1238
01:33:30,867 --> 01:33:32,698
You're 136.

1239
01:33:38,307 --> 01:33:39,899
There's someone sitting there.

1240
01:33:42,827 --> 01:33:44,579
Move when you're told.

1241
01:33:51,227 --> 01:33:52,740
Put it out.

1242
01:34:22,667 --> 01:34:25,261
<i>- How's your boy?
- He's good.</i>

1243
01:34:25,347 --> 01:34:28,225
<i>You know, he looks
more like you every day.</i>

1244
01:34:28,307 --> 01:34:30,946
<i>He's smarter than I am.</i>

1245
01:34:31,147 --> 01:34:33,146
<i>Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.</i>

1246
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:35,146
There's a hair
in the fucking projector!

1247
01:34:35,147 --> 01:34:38,457
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out the projector, will you?

1248
01:34:39,627 --> 01:34:42,539
- Come on. Get it out!
- Get it out!

1249
01:34:44,787 --> 01:34:46,584
We're going fucking blind up here.

1250
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:48,146
Lively.

1251
01:34:54,587 --> 01:34:56,259
<i>- We'll get there, Pop.
- Quiet.</i>

1252
01:34:56,347 --> 01:34:58,224
- I didn't say a fucking thing.
- You're blocking.

1253
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:00,537
Shut it.

1254
01:35:02,307 --> 01:35:04,696
<i>Now, listen.
Whoever comes to you...</i>

1255
01:35:04,787 --> 01:35:06,379
<i>with this Barzini meeting...</i>

1256
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:16,503
<i>I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this.</i>

1257
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:18,384
<i>And Fredo, well...</i>

1258
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,865
<i>Fredo was wrong.</i>

1259
01:35:24,307 --> 01:35:27,219
<i>And I never wanted this for you.</i>

1260
01:35:30,627 --> 01:35:31,298
For you!

1261
01:35:45,227 --> 01:35:47,263
To the floor, mate! Get down!

1262
01:35:54,427 --> 01:35:58,261
Come on, mate, get a blanket!
For God's sake, he's burning!

1263
01:35:59,147 --> 01:36:01,661
Barker! Move back, Barker!

1264
01:36:01,747 --> 01:36:03,305
Get in there!

1265
01:36:04,747 --> 01:36:06,738
Get it out!

1266
01:36:28,267 --> 01:36:30,940
- Stretcher!
- Let's check it out.

1267
01:36:31,147 --> 01:36:32,944
All right, mate.
You're with us.

1268
01:36:33,147 --> 01:36:34,626
All right. Stretcher!

1269
01:36:36,227 --> 01:36:37,546
Gently.

1270
01:36:37,627 --> 01:36:39,140
All right, up!

1271
01:36:40,307 --> 01:36:43,219
That was a good day's work,
McAndrew.

1272
01:36:43,307 --> 01:36:44,786
That was a good day's work.

1273
01:36:44,867 --> 01:36:47,301
Get away from me.

1274
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:49,742
Will you not look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you?

1275
01:36:52,387 --> 01:36:56,141
I know how to look at people
without blinking as well.

1276
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:02,181
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known...

1277
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:05,498
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1278
01:37:07,907 --> 01:37:10,899
You're a brave man, Joe,
a brave man.

1279
01:37:13,747 --> 01:37:16,146
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1280
01:37:16,147 --> 01:37:19,696
- Stand your ground.
- Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1281
01:37:19,787 --> 01:37:22,585
Benjamin Bailey, back to him cell!

1282
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:24,737
Burns, returning to his cell.

1283
01:37:24,827 --> 01:37:27,739
7445, Casey, back to his cell.

1284
01:37:27,827 --> 01:37:30,387
6309, Johnston, level three.

1285
01:37:30,467 --> 01:37:33,265
Regis, 113,
going up to number two.

1286
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:53,381
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1287
01:37:54,387 --> 01:37:56,298
<i>Barker was maimed for life...</i>

1288
01:37:56,387 --> 01:37:58,855
<i>and Joe was sent
to another prison.</i>

1289
01:37:58,947 --> 01:38:00,858
<i>He's in solitary confinement
somewhere.</i>

1290
01:38:00,947 --> 01:38:03,461
<i>We've had no news of him
since then.</i>

1291
01:38:03,547 --> 01:38:05,777
<i>The new chief screw
had the yard painted...</i>

1292
01:38:05,867 --> 01:38:07,778
<i>and I was back
walking in circles again.</i>

1293
01:38:07,867 --> 01:38:09,539
Back to the cells.

1294
01:38:12,227 --> 01:38:14,536
Come on. Move.

1295
01:38:42,147 --> 01:38:45,139
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da...

1296
01:38:46,347 --> 01:38:49,259
if that's all right with you.

1297
01:38:49,347 --> 01:38:50,939
Do you mean it?

1298
01:38:51,147 --> 01:38:52,580
Aye.

1299
01:38:53,507 --> 01:38:55,338
That's great.

1300
01:38:55,427 --> 01:38:58,897
What I need from you is
the whole story, your whole story...

1301
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:01,615
in as much detail
as you can remember.

1302
01:39:01,707 --> 01:39:05,302
<i>And I need you to write it down.
It's really important.</i>

1303
01:39:11,667 --> 01:39:13,464
I can't do this.

1304
01:39:15,347 --> 01:39:17,383
I can't write this, Da.

1305
01:39:17,467 --> 01:39:19,856
Could your son
not give you a hand?

1306
01:39:19,947 --> 01:39:22,666
He's up in his cell writing away.

1307
01:39:34,627 --> 01:39:36,538
Tape recorder.

1308
01:39:36,627 --> 01:39:38,504
You're a good talker.

1309
01:39:38,587 --> 01:39:40,145
Talk.

1310
01:39:41,747 --> 01:39:43,703
<i>The strange thing is...</i>

1311
01:39:44,787 --> 01:39:47,146
<i>the strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a littlejealous...</i>

1312
01:39:47,147 --> 01:39:49,741
<i>of me taking over the campaign
and that there.</i>

1313
01:39:49,827 --> 01:39:52,944
<i>Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.</i>

1314
01:39:53,147 --> 01:39:55,217
That's something
I never thought about Giuseppe:

1315
01:39:55,307 --> 01:39:57,138
<i>That he could bejealous.</i>

1316
01:40:00,147 --> 01:40:04,146
<i>Anyhow, the main thing is
to get the case reopened...</i>

1317
01:40:04,147 --> 01:40:07,822
<i>because I don't know how long
he can survive in here.</i>

1318
01:40:24,627 --> 01:40:28,586
- I'm tired of this.
- Come on. We have to do this.

1319
01:40:28,667 --> 01:40:30,180
You behave yourself.

1320
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:35,624
Get your head down.

1321
01:40:42,907 --> 01:40:46,138
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1322
01:40:46,227 --> 01:40:49,663
One day when you and Ma were out,
I got a big bowl of boiling water...

1323
01:40:49,747 --> 01:40:53,146
whacked a big drop of Vick
and put the towel over my head.

1324
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:56,822
I sat there trying to figure out what it
was about 'cause nothing was happening.

1325
01:40:56,907 --> 01:40:58,818
I figured you
must've been drinking it.

1326
01:40:58,907 --> 01:41:00,827
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1327
01:41:04,547 --> 01:41:06,503
How could I forget?

1328
01:41:07,347 --> 01:41:10,225
And your tongue
swelled up like a football.

1329
01:41:11,307 --> 01:41:13,423
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1330
01:41:13,507 --> 01:41:15,657
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1331
01:41:19,267 --> 01:41:20,700
Give us that.

1332
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:24,295
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1333
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:33,463
Was I always bad, was I?

1334
01:41:34,747 --> 01:41:36,180
Not always.

1335
01:41:36,267 --> 01:41:39,145
I don't deserve to spend
the rest of my life in here, do I?

1336
01:41:40,147 --> 01:41:42,615
All they've done
is block out the light.

1337
01:41:42,707 --> 01:41:44,618
They can't block out
the light in here.

1338
01:41:44,707 --> 01:41:46,504
Listen.

1339
01:41:46,587 --> 01:41:48,225
Every night...

1340
01:41:48,307 --> 01:41:50,741
I take your mother's
hand in mine.

1341
01:41:50,827 --> 01:41:54,900
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street...

1342
01:41:55,147 --> 01:41:58,298
down to Falls Road,
up the Antrim Road...

1343
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:01,778
to Cave Hill.

1344
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:03,505
We look back down...

1345
01:42:05,907 --> 01:42:07,943
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1346
01:42:11,347 --> 01:42:14,146
I've been doing that every night...

1347
01:42:14,147 --> 01:42:15,944
for five years now.

1348
01:42:18,147 --> 01:42:20,217
As if I never left your mother.

1349
01:42:30,147 --> 01:42:32,707
What I remember most
about my childhood is...

1350
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:34,778
holding your hand.

1351
01:42:34,867 --> 01:42:37,427
My wee hand in your big hand.

1352
01:42:37,507 --> 01:42:40,146
And the smell of tobacco.
I remember that...

1353
01:42:40,147 --> 01:42:43,344
I could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand.

1354
01:42:46,747 --> 01:42:50,581
When I want to feel happy, I try
to remember the smell of tobacco.

1355
01:42:54,307 --> 01:42:55,899
Hold my hand.

1356
01:42:56,147 --> 01:42:57,944
Get the fuck...

1357
01:42:59,147 --> 01:43:01,217
Don't go sentimental on me now.

1358
01:43:02,627 --> 01:43:06,381
Don't be upset, Da. Look,
I'll hold your hand if you like.

1359
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:10,699
I'm going to die.

1360
01:43:11,947 --> 01:43:13,858
Don't be saying that.

1361
01:43:14,787 --> 01:43:16,220
I'm scared.

1362
01:43:18,387 --> 01:43:20,378
You've no reason to be scared.

1363
01:43:20,467 --> 01:43:25,143
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1364
01:43:25,227 --> 01:43:28,902
I'm scared I'm gonna die here
among strangers.

1365
01:43:29,147 --> 01:43:30,466
You're not fucking dying.

1366
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:34,222
Can I not say a thing
without you fucking contradicting me?

1367
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:40,781
I'm scared to leave
your mother behind.

1368
01:43:42,787 --> 01:43:46,143
Look, you are not going to die,
all right, Da?

1369
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:51,942
Even if you do, sure I can
look after Ma all right.

1370
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:55,219
You think I'd leave
Sarah in your care?

1371
01:43:56,747 --> 01:43:58,419
What do you mean?

1372
01:43:58,507 --> 01:44:02,466
You haven't the maturity to take care
of yourself, let alone your mother.

1373
01:44:09,507 --> 01:44:12,146
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs Peirce.

1374
01:44:12,147 --> 01:44:14,342
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1375
01:44:14,427 --> 01:44:18,146
I'm the solicitor for the Conlons,
Chief Inspector.

1376
01:44:18,147 --> 01:44:21,901
Giuseppe Conlon is critically ill,
as you may know.

1377
01:44:22,147 --> 01:44:24,377
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1378
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:26,139
They want your clearance.

1379
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:29,146
That'll be difficult, Mrs Peirce.

1380
01:44:29,147 --> 01:44:32,537
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1381
01:44:32,627 --> 01:44:34,936
Society demands
that they serve their time.

1382
01:44:36,147 --> 01:44:38,456
But they didn't do it,
Chief Inspector.

1383
01:44:38,547 --> 01:44:40,146
Says who?

1384
01:44:40,147 --> 01:44:42,456
Say the real bombers.

1385
01:44:42,547 --> 01:44:45,186
They told you they did it,
Mr Dixon.

1386
01:44:45,267 --> 01:44:47,827
Gerry Conlon told me he did it,
Mrs Peirce.

1387
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:50,501
These people are liars.

1388
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:53,147
They're liars for a cause.
That's the worst kind.

1389
01:44:53,187 --> 01:44:55,417
But he's dying.
Giuseppe's dying.

1390
01:44:55,507 --> 01:44:58,544
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1391
01:45:03,147 --> 01:45:05,146
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1392
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:07,183
Is this your family, Mr Dixon?

1393
01:45:08,387 --> 01:45:10,343
That's my wife and my son.

1394
01:45:10,427 --> 01:45:12,861
You have another appointment.

1395
01:45:12,947 --> 01:45:14,266
Yes.

1396
01:45:15,627 --> 01:45:18,699
I'll see you again, Mr Dixon.

1397
01:45:54,707 --> 01:45:56,584
Are you all right, Da?

1398
01:46:10,187 --> 01:46:12,382
Are you all right?

1399
01:46:15,187 --> 01:46:16,620
Wake up, Da.

1400
01:46:17,667 --> 01:46:20,943
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Giuseppe?

1401
01:46:22,147 --> 01:46:24,067
Come on, dear God in heaven,
don't do this to me.

1402
01:46:24,147 --> 01:46:25,421
Come on. Wake up.

1403
01:46:25,507 --> 01:46:27,737
Wake up! Fuck's sake, come on!

1404
01:46:27,827 --> 01:46:31,376
There you go. Thank you.
You're all right, Da.

1405
01:46:31,467 --> 01:46:33,423
I'm going to get some help.

1406
01:46:33,507 --> 01:46:36,146
Number 73! Number 73!

1407
01:46:36,147 --> 01:46:38,707
Please come quickly!
My father's sick!

1408
01:46:38,787 --> 01:46:40,379
Benbay, Giuseppe's taken bad!

1409
01:46:40,467 --> 01:46:42,146
Put your arms around me.

1410
01:46:42,147 --> 01:46:45,264
I'm getting you out of bed.
Put your arms around me.

1411
01:46:48,147 --> 01:46:50,786
- Open the fucking door!
- He's number 73!

1412
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:52,619
- Open the fucking door!
- Giuseppe!

1413
01:46:53,827 --> 01:46:56,500
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1414
01:46:57,347 --> 01:47:00,817
He can't breathe!
Look, my father's fucking dying!

1415
01:47:00,907 --> 01:47:03,899
- He needs oxygen!
- Give him a fucking break!

1416
01:47:04,147 --> 01:47:06,866
Open the fucking gate!
I'm right here, Da.

1417
01:47:06,947 --> 01:47:08,858
Get him in here!

1418
01:47:08,947 --> 01:47:11,336
What the fuck is going on?

1419
01:47:15,747 --> 01:47:17,339
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1420
01:47:17,427 --> 01:47:19,179
I want to go with him.

1421
01:47:20,427 --> 01:47:23,544
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1422
01:47:23,627 --> 01:47:25,822
You're gonna be all right, Da!

1423
01:47:25,907 --> 01:47:29,138
- I'll be with you as soon as I can.
- Take him back to his cell.

1424
01:47:34,707 --> 01:47:39,146
Leave him alone, you bastards!
Just let him be!

1425
01:47:39,147 --> 01:47:42,146
Stay strong, Gerry!
Stay strong, mate!

1426
01:47:42,147 --> 01:47:44,146
Keep your chin up, mate!

1427
01:47:44,147 --> 01:47:45,865
We're with you, Gerry!

1428
01:47:45,947 --> 01:47:48,142
We're with you all the way, mate!

1429
01:48:01,227 --> 01:48:02,819
He's still awake.

1430
01:48:17,747 --> 01:48:20,136
Your father passed away
an hour ago.

1431
01:48:21,227 --> 01:48:22,819
Thank you very much.

1432
01:48:25,347 --> 01:48:27,144
I'm sorry.

1433
01:48:58,587 --> 01:49:00,578
Giuseppe is dead, man!

1434
01:49:01,547 --> 01:49:03,617
They kill Giuseppe!

1435
01:49:09,387 --> 01:49:10,820
Gerry, man!

1436
01:49:15,867 --> 01:49:17,664
They killed Giuseppe!

1437
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:09,145
Well, I think they ought to take
the word "compassion"...

1438
01:50:09,187 --> 01:50:11,143
out of the English dictionary.

1439
01:50:14,227 --> 01:50:16,297
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1440
01:50:19,267 --> 01:50:22,942
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1441
01:50:24,147 --> 01:50:27,139
Believe me, if there's one thing
I know about, it's guilt.

1442
01:50:28,507 --> 01:50:32,182
Keep looking 'em in the eye,
and it's gonna reveal itself.

1443
01:50:32,267 --> 01:50:34,337
You have to keep up the pressure.

1444
01:50:37,387 --> 01:50:39,343
Do what you have to do.

1445
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:44,146
Free the Four! Free the Four!

1446
01:51:03,267 --> 01:51:05,940
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1447
01:51:09,147 --> 01:51:12,583
"The Parade of Innocence."
What do you think?

1448
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:15,146
<i>Thousands of people
lined the streets of Dublin...</i>

1449
01:51:15,147 --> 01:51:16,739
<i>London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations...</i>

1450
01:51:16,827 --> 01:51:18,863
<i>demanding the release
of the Guildford Four.</i>

1451
01:51:18,947 --> 01:51:22,146
<i>- Questions have been raised...
- Say good night to Daddy.</i>

1452
01:51:22,147 --> 01:51:24,581
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, son.

1453
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:26,498
Free the Four! Free the Four!

1454
01:51:39,467 --> 01:51:41,503
This was a mistake.

1455
01:51:42,467 --> 01:51:44,742
Why don't we let her
see the files?

1456
01:51:44,827 --> 01:51:47,136
What harm could it do?

1457
01:51:47,187 --> 01:51:49,781
- Mr Dixon!
- Yes?

1458
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:51,778
Don't you get tired of this?

1459
01:51:51,867 --> 01:51:54,947
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Giuseppe Conlon case files.

1460
01:51:58,467 --> 01:52:01,220
- Good morning.
- There are a few rules to be observed.

1461
01:52:02,947 --> 01:52:05,307
Here's a complete list of
the Conlon, Giuseppe case files...

1462
01:52:05,347 --> 01:52:07,258
the only files you'll need to see.

1463
01:52:07,347 --> 01:52:09,577
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1464
01:52:09,667 --> 01:52:12,386
You take a page at a time,
read it and then return it.

1465
01:52:12,467 --> 01:52:15,265
Sorry. Is there a problem,
Mr Dixon?

1466
01:52:15,347 --> 01:52:17,224
Problem?
Not at all, Mrs Peirce.

1467
01:52:17,307 --> 01:52:20,777
Our chief archivist, Mr Jenkins,
is here to assist you.

1468
01:52:21,787 --> 01:52:24,221
If you want to make a photocopy,
I alone will do it.

1469
01:52:24,307 --> 01:52:27,140
Use this pen at all times
for any notes.

1470
01:52:27,227 --> 01:52:30,776
If you deface any document, we can
trace it through the ink in this pen.

1471
01:52:30,867 --> 01:52:35,463
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs Peirce.

1472
01:52:35,547 --> 01:52:37,503
We wouldn't want
police intelligence files...

1473
01:52:37,587 --> 01:52:40,818
leaked to the IRA now, would we?

1474
01:52:43,467 --> 01:52:45,264
Conlon, Giuseppe file.

1475
01:52:45,347 --> 01:52:47,258
Yes, sir.

1476
01:53:00,147 --> 01:53:02,615
Leave my kit on the bus,
'cause I'm not staying in your jail.

1477
01:53:02,707 --> 01:53:06,382
So, our new VIP prisoner.

1478
01:53:06,467 --> 01:53:07,866
Welcome to Scotland.

1479
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:10,142
I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1480
01:53:10,187 --> 01:53:14,339
He died in one of your jails.
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1481
01:53:14,427 --> 01:53:16,338
They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break my confidence.

1482
01:53:16,427 --> 01:53:19,817
- Put him in solitary.
- This is a peaceful protest.

1483
01:53:19,907 --> 01:53:21,465
We'll teach you manners.

1484
01:53:21,547 --> 01:53:23,299
Better men than you
have tried that already.

1485
01:53:23,387 --> 01:53:25,901
I have not seen my client
for two months.

1486
01:53:26,147 --> 01:53:29,617
He's been moved to Scotland, which has
impeded my investigation into his case.

1487
01:53:29,707 --> 01:53:33,382
So I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access...

1488
01:53:33,467 --> 01:53:35,139
Free the Four!

1489
01:53:50,947 --> 01:53:52,665
Here, thanks a lot. Good day.

1490
01:53:52,747 --> 01:53:54,385
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1491
01:54:12,147 --> 01:54:15,378
Sorry. Could you copy that
for me, please?

1492
01:54:16,347 --> 01:54:18,497
Thank you.

1493
01:54:27,947 --> 01:54:30,905
<i>I just want my mother to be happy.</i>

1494
01:54:32,307 --> 01:54:35,458
<i>I'd like her to know...</i>

1495
01:54:35,547 --> 01:54:39,222
<i>that Giuseppe talked about her
every day of his life.</i>

1496
01:54:41,707 --> 01:54:43,663
<i>He missed her terribly.</i>

1497
01:54:48,587 --> 01:54:51,499
<i>It's strange to be in a cell
without him.</i>

1498
01:54:54,147 --> 01:54:56,741
<i>I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.</i>

1499
01:54:56,827 --> 01:54:58,738
<i>Everywhere I look, I see him.</i>

1500
01:55:06,147 --> 01:55:10,265
<i>Strange what time does
when you're in prison.</i>

1501
01:55:12,507 --> 01:55:16,341
<i>Like, you can be staring
at the wall.</i>

1502
01:55:16,427 --> 01:55:18,861
<i>Drip, drip, drip.</i>

1503
01:55:21,187 --> 01:55:22,586
<i>It takes an eternity.</i>

1504
01:55:22,667 --> 01:55:25,943
<i>And then you blink,
and three years have gone by.</i>

1505
01:55:30,947 --> 01:55:33,146
<i>I mean, what I'm trying to...</i>

1506
01:55:33,147 --> 01:55:36,184
<i>I don't know what the fuck
I'm trying to say.</i>

1507
01:55:38,587 --> 01:55:41,545
<i>But I can't forget
what they did to my family.</i>

1508
01:55:43,307 --> 01:55:44,820
<i>I just can't forget.</i>

1509
01:56:33,867 --> 01:56:35,220
Morning.

1510
01:56:36,507 --> 01:56:39,146
- Where's Jenkins?
- He telephoned in sick.

1511
01:56:39,187 --> 01:56:41,496
I'm afraid you're going
to have to come back tomorrow.

1512
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:44,340
I can't. I'm in court tomorrow.
There's too much to get through.

1513
01:56:44,427 --> 01:56:45,906
I can't help you.

1514
01:56:46,147 --> 01:56:47,899
Please. I've got the court order.

1515
01:56:48,147 --> 01:56:50,388
You saw what Mr Jenkins did.
He just brings me the files.

1516
01:56:50,467 --> 01:56:52,935
I take the notes and give them
back to you. Please.

1517
01:56:53,147 --> 01:56:55,741
- What name is it?
- Conlon.

1518
01:56:55,827 --> 01:56:58,864
- All right.
- Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1519
01:57:04,787 --> 01:57:06,505
What name was that again?

1520
01:57:08,187 --> 01:57:10,337
We've got two Conlon boxes.

1521
01:57:10,427 --> 01:57:14,181
Is it Giuseppe Conlon
or Gerard Conlon?

1522
01:57:16,227 --> 01:57:17,660
Gerard.

1523
01:57:25,147 --> 01:57:27,138
Well, that's for starters.

1524
01:57:49,147 --> 01:57:50,421
<i>Fuck 'em!</i>

1525
01:57:53,187 --> 01:57:54,620
It's good news.

1526
01:57:55,787 --> 01:57:59,143
We're talking about
a piece of evidence...

1527
01:57:59,227 --> 01:58:02,617
that says they knew all along,
that they let my father die in prison?

1528
01:58:02,707 --> 01:58:05,665
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that?

1529
01:58:05,747 --> 01:58:07,658
We'll get them in court.

1530
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:10,580
"We'll get them in court"?
Will you catch yourself on?

1531
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:13,739
They've kept us in prison for 15 years.
They can keep us in for another 15.

1532
01:58:13,827 --> 01:58:15,738
This is the fucking
government, Gareth!

1533
01:58:15,827 --> 01:58:18,864
It's the fucking government!
What are they gonna say?

1534
01:58:18,947 --> 01:58:21,142
"We're sorry about that"?

1535
01:58:22,307 --> 01:58:25,265
"Made a wee bit of a mistake,
but you can be on your way now"?

1536
01:58:25,347 --> 01:58:27,497
What are they gonna say?
"Sorry we killed your da"?

1537
01:58:27,587 --> 01:58:30,499
"Sorry we fucked
your fucking life to hell"?

1538
01:58:47,947 --> 01:58:50,905
I am not putting my mother
through hell again.

1539
01:58:51,947 --> 01:58:53,699
Are you afraid of court?

1540
01:58:53,787 --> 01:58:56,142
I just don't wanna be
humiliated again.

1541
01:59:17,267 --> 01:59:18,825
I swear by Almighty God...

1542
01:59:18,907 --> 01:59:22,297
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

1543
01:59:22,387 --> 01:59:24,343
and nothing but the truth.

1544
01:59:31,387 --> 01:59:35,744
Mr Dixon, do you know
these young people...

1545
01:59:35,827 --> 01:59:38,182
known as the Guildford Four?

1546
01:59:40,827 --> 01:59:42,226
Yes, I do.

1547
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:45,424
Do you know how long
they have spent in jail?

1548
01:59:46,467 --> 01:59:47,866
Fifteen years.

1549
01:59:50,627 --> 01:59:52,379
Do you know Annie Maguire...

1550
01:59:53,347 --> 01:59:56,544
who served her 14 years
without remission?

1551
01:59:57,587 --> 02:00:00,420
Do you know her son Vincent
who served five years?

1552
02:00:00,507 --> 02:00:03,260
Her son Patrick who served four?
Do you know her husband...

1553
02:00:03,347 --> 02:00:06,305
Paddy Maguire, who served 12 years?

1554
02:00:07,387 --> 02:00:11,300
Carole Richardson was 17
when she went to jail, Mr Dixon.

1555
02:00:11,387 --> 02:00:13,218
Now she is 32.

1556
02:00:15,147 --> 02:00:17,146
Do you know Carole Richardson?

1557
02:00:17,147 --> 02:00:21,425
- What is the point of this?
- Yes, come to the point.

1558
02:00:27,707 --> 02:00:31,143
Do you know who this is, Mr Dixon?

1559
02:00:34,947 --> 02:00:36,744
No, I don't.

1560
02:00:36,827 --> 02:00:38,624
Well, then would you be so kind...

1561
02:00:38,707 --> 02:00:42,146
as to read this statement
that you took from him...

1562
02:00:42,147 --> 02:00:45,139
on the third of November, 1974?

1563
02:00:45,227 --> 02:00:48,936
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all of these people...

1564
02:00:49,147 --> 02:00:51,945
- all these innocent people.
- I need to see a copy of this statement.

1565
02:00:52,147 --> 02:00:55,583
Either that man or his superior
or his superior's superior...

1566
02:00:55,667 --> 02:00:58,739
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats...

1567
02:00:58,827 --> 02:01:01,944
by a nation
that was baying for blood...

1568
02:01:02,147 --> 02:01:04,900
in return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1569
02:01:05,147 --> 02:01:08,146
- You got your blood, Mr Dixon!
- She is making a political speech.

1570
02:01:08,147 --> 02:01:11,696
You got the blood of Giuseppe Conlon
and the lifeblood of Carole Richardson!

1571
02:01:11,787 --> 02:01:14,904
You got 15 years of blood and sweat
and pain from my client...

1572
02:01:15,147 --> 02:01:17,820
whose only crime
was that he was Irish...

1573
02:01:17,907 --> 02:01:20,546
and foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

1574
02:01:20,627 --> 02:01:23,664
Mrs Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

1575
02:01:29,747 --> 02:01:32,341
And one of your colleagues,
My Lord...

1576
02:01:32,427 --> 02:01:35,499
who sat where you sit now said,
"It is a pity..."

1577
02:01:35,587 --> 02:01:38,146
you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

1578
02:01:38,147 --> 02:01:41,856
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging...

1579
02:01:41,947 --> 02:01:45,178
"a sentence I would have no difficulty
in passing in this case."

1580
02:01:45,267 --> 02:01:48,179
Mrs Peirce, I am trying
to read this document.

1581
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:51,498
I will not tell you again
to be silent...

1582
02:01:51,587 --> 02:01:55,136
or you will be removed
from the court.

1583
02:02:37,147 --> 02:02:39,377
My Lord, this document...

1584
02:02:39,467 --> 02:02:42,618
brings the entire British
legal system into disrepute.

1585
02:02:42,707 --> 02:02:45,267
My Lord, this is new evidence.

1586
02:02:45,347 --> 02:02:47,383
It is shocking new evidence.

1587
02:02:47,467 --> 02:02:49,146
My Lord, this evidence...

1588
02:02:49,147 --> 02:02:52,344
was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal.

1589
02:02:52,427 --> 02:02:56,136
That, I believe, is the point
Mrs Peirce is trying to make.

1590
02:02:56,187 --> 02:02:58,860
- Proceed, Mrs Peirce.
- My Lord, I demand a recess.

1591
02:02:58,947 --> 02:03:02,940
There will be no demands made
in my court.

1592
02:03:03,147 --> 02:03:04,466
Stand back.

1593
02:03:09,147 --> 02:03:11,707
This alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1594
02:03:11,787 --> 02:03:13,539
was taken by Mr Dixon...

1595
02:03:13,627 --> 02:03:16,858
one month after
Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1596
02:03:16,947 --> 02:03:21,146
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

1597
02:03:21,147 --> 02:03:24,503
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defense."

1598
02:03:30,467 --> 02:03:33,539
I have one question
to ask you, Mr Dixon:

1599
02:03:33,627 --> 02:03:35,777
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1600
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:40,145
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people...

1601
02:03:40,227 --> 02:03:42,263
kept from the defense?

1602
02:03:50,147 --> 02:03:52,138
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

1603
02:03:52,907 --> 02:03:54,818
Silence!

1604
02:03:54,907 --> 02:03:57,944
- It's about time!
- Order in the court!

1605
02:03:59,347 --> 02:04:02,145
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

1606
02:04:02,187 --> 02:04:03,779
This is most irregular.

1607
02:04:03,867 --> 02:04:06,540
Yes. I am aware of that, My Lord.

1608
02:04:07,427 --> 02:04:09,304
Very well.

1609
02:04:24,747 --> 02:04:27,307
Mr Dixon, you may stand down.

1610
02:04:28,867 --> 02:04:32,177
This is the man
who should be under arrest!

1611
02:04:32,267 --> 02:04:34,462
Be silent, Mrs Peirce!

1612
02:04:34,547 --> 02:04:36,856
- This court is now in recess.
- Guards, get ready.

1613
02:04:36,947 --> 02:04:39,336
Don't try and make me
the fall guy...

1614
02:04:39,427 --> 02:04:42,385
for the whole
British legal establishment.

1615
02:04:46,467 --> 02:04:48,537
If I accept this mercy deal...

1616
02:04:48,627 --> 02:04:50,538
They have a flipping cheek,
offering me mercy.

1617
02:04:50,627 --> 02:04:52,538
They should be begging
for mercy themselves.

1618
02:04:52,627 --> 02:04:54,299
- You ready, Mr Conlon?
- Aye.

1619
02:04:54,387 --> 02:04:56,457
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

1620
02:04:56,547 --> 02:04:59,146
The truth has to come out.
They may not want to hear it...

1621
02:04:59,147 --> 02:05:01,146
but there's people outside
who'll listen.

1622
02:05:01,147 --> 02:05:03,707
- Just think about it, will you?
- All right.

1623
02:05:03,787 --> 02:05:05,937
Aye. Give us three of them.

1624
02:05:21,667 --> 02:05:23,259
Silence!

1625
02:05:25,907 --> 02:05:28,546
<i>In the matter of Her Majesty...</i>

1626
02:05:28,627 --> 02:05:31,425
<i>versus Gerard Patrick Conlon...</i>

1627
02:05:31,507 --> 02:05:34,419
the case is hereby dismissed.

1628
02:05:39,147 --> 02:05:41,342
My husband died in your prison
an innocent man!

1629
02:05:41,427 --> 02:05:44,737
I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.

1630
02:05:44,827 --> 02:05:46,863
- This way.
- I'm going out the front door.

1631
02:05:46,947 --> 02:05:48,221
What about Giuseppe Conlon?

1632
02:05:48,307 --> 02:05:51,140
Your Honor,
he was an innocent man!

1633
02:05:53,827 --> 02:05:55,579
Mr Conlon, that's not a good idea.

1634
02:05:55,667 --> 02:05:57,419
Use the back,
for security reasons.

1635
02:05:57,507 --> 02:05:59,577
I'm a free man,
and I'm going out the front door.

1636
02:06:00,707 --> 02:06:04,222
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Paul Hill...</i>

1637
02:06:04,307 --> 02:06:07,936
the case is hereby dismissed.

1638
02:06:14,747 --> 02:06:18,945
Leave me alone!
I'm going out the front door with Gerry!

1639
02:06:21,267 --> 02:06:26,261
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Patrick Armstrong...</i>

1640
02:06:26,347 --> 02:06:28,338
the case is hereby dismissed.

1641
02:06:30,507 --> 02:06:35,137
<i>In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Carole Richardson...</i>

1642
02:06:35,187 --> 02:06:38,657
the case is hereby dismissed.

1643
02:06:38,747 --> 02:06:40,260
I'm an innocent man!

1644
02:06:40,347 --> 02:06:44,181
I spent 15 years in prison
for something I didn't do!

1645
02:06:44,267 --> 02:06:46,178
I watched my father die...

1646
02:06:46,267 --> 02:06:49,145
in a British prison
for something he didn't do!

1647
02:06:49,187 --> 02:06:52,145
And this government
still says he's guilty!

1648
02:06:52,227 --> 02:06:53,899
I want to tell them...

1649
02:06:54,147 --> 02:06:57,139
that until my father
is proved innocent...

1650
02:06:57,187 --> 02:07:01,260
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent...

1651
02:07:01,347 --> 02:07:03,861
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice...

1652
02:07:03,947 --> 02:07:06,146
I will fight on...

1653
02:07:06,147 --> 02:07:09,776
in the name of my father
and of the truth!
