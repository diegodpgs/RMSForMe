153
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,581
You two having fun
disintegrating things ?

154
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,883
<i>Not disintegrating,
digitizing.</i>

155
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:17,687
A laser dismantles
the molecular structure
of the object,

156
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:21,157
And molecules remain
suspended in the laser beam.

157
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,726
Then, when the computer
plays out the model,

158
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:27,230
The molecules fall back
into place, and voilá !

159
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,565
Great.  Can it
send me to hawaii ?

160
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:34,504
Yeah, but you've got to
purchase your program
30 days in advance.

161
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,639
How's it going upstairs ?

162
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:40,443
Frustrating.
I had tron almost ready...

163
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:43,780
When dillinger cut everyone
with group-7 access
out of the system.

164
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:47,984
Ever since he got
that master control program,

165
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:50,553
The system's got more bugs
than a bait store.

166
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,555
You gotta expect
some static.

167
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,458
After all, computers
are just machines.
They can't think.

168
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:57,460
Some programs will
be thinking soon.

169
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:59,796
[ chuckles ]
won't that be grand ?

170
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:03,599
Computers and programs
will start thinking,
and the people will stop.

171
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,269
I'm gonna stay around,
put some data through.
See you tomorrow.

172
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,438
Bye.

173
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,807
Come on.

174
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:14,010
Did you say
group-7 access ?
Yeah.

175
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:17,280
What a hassle.
I was all set.

176
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:20,483
Did he say why ?
Something about tampering.

177
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:21,751
Tampering ?

178
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:27,637
Flynn has been thinking
about breaking into the system
ever since dillinger canned him.

179
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,773
And he had
group-7 access.

180
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:32,776
Flynn had access
to you too.

181
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,981
[ lora ]  I want to
go to flynn's place.

182
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,983
<i>What for ?
To warn him.</i>

183
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:44,421
Of what ?
That dillinger's onto him.

184
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:47,891
I don't see why I have
to do that guy any favors.

185
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,393
I don't know what you
ever saw in that guy,
anyway.

186
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:54,064
I loved him for his brains.
[ chuckles ]

187
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:57,534
Don't put any change
in the meter.  We're gonna
need it for the games.

188
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:05,242
Boy !  I haven't been
here in a long time.

189
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,345
¶ [ music ]
[ chattering ]

190
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:16,753
[ girl ]
hey, bobby, up here.

191
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,611
Where is he ?
I don't know.

192
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,947
Somewhere in here,
lost in one of his games.

193
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:51,788
Excuse me.
Do you know
where flynn is ?

194
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,790
Yeah, he's over there
on his machine.

195
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,267
[ boy ]
he's really on a roll !
One more reco before he ties.

196
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:08,371
Another reco and he gets
the world's record.

197
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,885
[ boy ]
he's going for the record.
The all-time record coming up.

198
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,025
This is it.
It's all over.

199
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,197
Flynn's gonna be
a part of history, all right !

200
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:40,937
<i>Hey, flynn,
how'd you do it ?</i>

201
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:44,040
It's all
in the wrists.

202
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:46,777
<i>999,000 points !</i>

203
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,915
Hey, good
to see you guys.

204
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,985
Nothing classes up the joint
like a clean-cut young couple.

205
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,020
We gotta talk.

206
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,156
You can't hear yourself
think in here.  Come on.

207
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,960
Come on.
I'll be down
in a minute.

208
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,864
How's the world
of serious science ?

209
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,866
Go up ahead.
Make yourselves
at home.

210
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,035
<i>Be right up.</i>

211
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:18,809
[ chuckles ]
the best programmer
encom ever saw,

212
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:23,213
And he winds up playing
space cowboy in some back room.

213
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,215
Okay, let me
handle this.

214
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,284
Go right ahead.

215
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,754
Have you been sneaking
into the encom system ?

216
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,459
You never were much
for small talk, were you ?

217
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,497
- she still leave her clothes
all over the floor ?
- no.

218
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:43,600
- alan !
- I mean, not that often.

219
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,836
You can see why
all his friends
are 14 years old.

220
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:48,572
Touché.

221
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,117
I have been doing
a little hacking,
as a matter of fact.

222
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:02,853
- you did break in.
- tried to.

223
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,490
I can't seem to quite
get the connection
with that sucker, though.

224
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:08,592
If I had
a direct terminal--

225
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,627
Flynn, are you embezzling ?

226
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:12,629
[ game beeping ]

227
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:16,266
Embezzling is such
an ugly word, mr. Bradley.

228
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,369
No, actually,
I'm trying to get some
solid evidence together.

229
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:23,640
- I don't get it.
- okay.

230
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:28,512
Sherman, set the way-back
machine for three years ago.

231
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,814
Kevin flynn,

232
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:35,185
One of encom's
brightest young
software engineers.

233
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:37,821
He's so bright,
he starts going in at night,

234
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:39,823
Sets up his own private
memory file...

235
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:44,161
And begins writing
a program for video games,
invented called...

236
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,329
Space paranoids.

237
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,799
You invented
space paranoids ?

238
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:52,502
Paranoids, matrix blaster,
vice squad--
a whole slew of 'em.

239
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,071
I was this close to starting
my own little enterprise.

240
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:58,975
<i>But enter another
software engineer;</i>

241
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:02,145
Not so young, not so bright,
but very, very sneaky;

242
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:04,781
Ed dillinger.

243
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,084
<i>One night, our boy flynn,
he goes to his terminal,
tries to read up his file.</i>

244
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:11,421
I get nothing on there.
There's a big blank.

245
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,490
All right, now we take you
three months later,

246
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,394
Dillinger presents encom
with five video games...

247
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,396
That he's invented.

248
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,731
<i>The slime didn't even
change the names, man !</i>

249
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,733
<i>He gets
a big, fat promotion.</i>

250
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,570
Thus begins
his meteoric rise to--
what is he now ?

251
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:29,840
- executive v.P. ?
- senior exec ?

252
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:32,075
Senior exec ?

253
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:40,217
Meanwhile, kids are putting
eight million quarters a week
into paranoid machines.

254
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:43,186
I don't see a dime, except
what I squeeze outta here.

255
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:47,390
I still don't understand
why you want to
break into the system.

256
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:52,262
Because, man, somewhere
in one of these memories
is the evidence.

257
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,398
If I got in far enough
I could reconstruct it.

258
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:58,401
My password,
dillinger's instructions
to divert the data--

259
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:02,539
It's too late for that !
Dillinger's cut off everybody
with group-7 access.

260
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:05,041
Wait.  Wait.
What are you saying ?

261
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,211
The guy knows
what you're up to.

262
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,281
Great.
You're kidding me ?

263
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:17,854
Well, now there is
nothing to stop him.

264
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:22,259
It's just dillinger
and the mcp running things
from on high now.

265
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:26,329
Not if my tron program
was running.  That'd
shut the system down.

266
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,636
You know, if your file
was in there--

267
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:34,704
Wait a minute.
If we can get in there,

268
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,073
I can forge us
a group-6 access.

269
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:42,345
<i>Well ?
Shall we dance ?</i>

270
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:54,257
[ dillinger ]
I shut down group-7
for a very good reason.

271
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:58,462
Ed, all I'm saying is
if our people can't get
access to their programs--

272
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,598
Well, you know how frustrating
it is when you're working
on a piece of research.

273
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,302
I sympathize,
but I have data coming from
the master control program...

274
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:07,671
Telling me there's
something screwy going on.

275
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:10,340
That mcp,
that's half our problem
right there.

276
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:13,510
The mcp is the most efficient
way of handling what we do !

277
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,713
I can't sit here
and worry about every little
user request that comes in.

278
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:19,015
User requests are
what computers are for.

279
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,751
Doing our business is
what computers are for !

280
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:43,039
Encom isn't
the business you started
in your garage anymore.

281
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:46,643
We're building accounts
in 30 different countries,
new defense systems.

282
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:49,746
We have one of the most
sophisticated pieces of
equipment in existence.

283
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,782
Oh, I know all that.

284
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,820
Sometimes I wish I were
back in that garage.

285
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,156
That can be arranged, walter.

286
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,726
That was uncalled for.

287
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:06,863
You can remove men like
alan and me from the system,
but we helped create it.

288
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:11,168
And our spirit remains in
every program we designed
for this computer.

289
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,503
Walter, it's getting late.
I've got better things to do...

290
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,739
Than to have religious
discussions with you.

291
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:20,343
Don't worry about encom anymore.
It's out of your hands now.

292
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:31,021
I don't think
I'm cleared for this.

293
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,156
I'm certainly not.
You wanna move aside ?

294
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:35,492
Give the kid
a little room.

295
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:41,031
This guy's a little
like santa claus.

296
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,634
I make these myself.
You want one ?

297
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,882
[ flynn ]
they never should have
gotten rid of me.

298
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:05,255
Now that is a big door.
Shut up.

299
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:17,067
It's my fault.

611

Limited four and eight
are missing.

00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:27,100
Oh !

615
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:29,702
Yori.

616
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:33,840
I knew you'd escape.

617
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,676
They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.

618
00:58:36,744 --> 00:58:39,813
Listen !
We have to make plans.

619
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,315
Where can we go ?

620
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:49,622
This way, quickly.

621
00:58:56,697 --> 00:58:58,665
Hey !

622
00:59:01,435 --> 00:59:03,937
Hold it right there !

00:59:04,004 --> 00:59:06,005
<i>Yes ?
What do you
mean, "yes" ?</i>

624
00:59:06,073 --> 00:59:08,007
Yes.

625
00:59:08,075 --> 00:59:11,144
Is that all
you can say ?

626
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:14,180
No.

627
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:17,016
Anything else ?
Yes.

628
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:21,387
Positive and negative, huh ?
You're a bit.

629
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:24,224
Yes.

630
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,960
Where's your program ?
Isn't he gonna miss you ?

631
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:30,697
- no.
- I'm your program.

632
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:34,634
- yes.
- another mouth to feed.

633
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:38,238
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes !

634
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:49,382
Watch out
for nested macros.

635
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:54,053
Who are these weirdos ?
Inoperative data pushers.

Aah !

642
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:47,273
This baby doesn't
handle so good in town.
No.

643
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:53,780
What's this do ?
How 'bout this one ?
No.  No.

644
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,785
[ flynn ]
here comes a headache.

645
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:03,256
Aah !
No-no-no-no !

646
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:08,895
We gotta stop
this thing !
Yes !

647
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:12,398
[ flynn ]
I'm glad you agree !

648
01:01:34,054 --> 01:01:37,023
Uh, I'm fine.
No problem.

649
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:43,296
Oh, this town
is full of live ones.

650
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:58,044
This is where tron
said he was going.

651
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:03,316
Losing flynn.

652
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,348
I don't believe this.

653
01:02:47,128 --> 01:02:48,728
Halt !

654
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,204
More guards.

655
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:57,130
They don't see us.
I'll go first.

656
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:21,688
Are you all right ?

657
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:24,090
Yeah.  Let's do
that some more.

658
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:26,226
I think the guard saw me.

659
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:28,228
Come on !

660
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:38,304
Halt.
Dumont.

661
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:40,907
I can't stand this commotion.
What do you want ?

662
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,276
I've come to communicate
with my user.

663
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:47,914
Difficult proposition.
Difficult proposition
at best.

664
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:51,017
Why, I could be de-rezzed
just for letting you in here.

665
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:56,523
They hate this tower.
They'd close it down
if they dared.

666
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,625
They keep me around
just in case one of them...

667
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:01,294
Wants to deal
with the other world
once in a while.

668
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:04,731
Dumont !

669
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,568
My user has information
that could--

670
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:10,970
Could make this
a free system again.

671
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:12,739
<i>[ chuckle ]
no, really !</i>

672
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:16,576
You'd have programs
lined up to use this place,

673
01:05:16,644 --> 01:05:19,412
And no mcp looking
over your shoulder.

674
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,714
When you've been in the system
as long as I have,

675
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:24,050
You hear many promises,
many reassurances,

676
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:27,053
Many brave plans.
Please, dumont !

677
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:31,758
The guards are coming.

678
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:34,260
There they are
with the guardian.

679
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:36,463
All right, yori.
All right.

680
01:05:39,066 --> 01:05:39,466
Who is your user, program ?

681
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,105
Alan-1.

682
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:47,474
He calls me.
May I pass ?

683
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:50,610
All that is visible...

684
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:52,979
Must grow beyond itself,

685
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:55,815
And extend into
the realm of the invisible.

686
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,885
You may pass, my friend.

687
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:10,897
The tower guardian
is helping him.

688
01:06:10,965 --> 01:06:13,066
He thinks.

689
01:06:13,134 --> 01:06:15,401
Bring in
the logic probe.

690
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,156
[ sark ]
more power !

691
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,451
It's begun.

692
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,522
[ alan ]
tron, location query.
Confirm.

693
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,858
Confirmed, alan-1.

694
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:47,093
[ alan ]  I am creating
the information on your disk...

695
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:50,864
That will erase the mcp
and change the system.

696
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:52,999
Dedicate yourself to getting
the disk into the heart...

697
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:55,001
Of the mcp.

698
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:57,537
This interface is
located at its base.

699
01:07:57,605 --> 01:08:01,708
We will not be able
to communicate again
unless you succeed.

700
01:08:01,776 --> 01:08:03,676
Go !

701
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:16,956
This is the key
to a new order.

702
01:08:17,024 --> 01:08:20,960
This code disk
means freedom.

703
01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:25,231
I think they're
breaking in.

704
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,109
Thank you, dumont.
Hurry !  The users
are waiting.

705
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:53,259
[ sark ]

706
01:08:56,664 --> 01:08:59,499
Where's the program ?

707
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:01,634
What program ?

708
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,004
Take him !

709
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:16,816
Stay close.

710
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:30,396
If I can just get us
on the scanning transport beam,

711
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:34,167
This solar sail simulation
will take us across
the game sea,

712
01:09:34,235 --> 01:09:36,436
Out of this domain,
back into the central computer.

713

Look out !

I wonder how you'd take to
working in a pocket calculator.

I took a wrong turn
somewhere.

If you are a user,

Everything you've done

to a plan, right ?

<i>You guys know
what it's like.</i>

744
01:13:14,255 --> 01:13:17,590
You keep doing what it looks
like you're supposed to,
no matter how crazy it seems.

745
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:20,426
That's the way it is
for programs, yes.

746

Hate to disappoint you, pal,
but most of the time, that's
the way it is for users too.

747
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:27,033
Stranger
and stranger.

01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:30,670
So, nice-looking ship
you got here.

749
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:52,992
What do you want done with
the tower guardian-- dumont ?

750
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,361
Put him with
the others ?

751
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:58,131
No, bit brain, prepare
him for inquisition.

752
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:00,133
I need a little bit
of relaxation.

753
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:02,168
First, rezz up
the carrier for pursuit.

754
01:14:02,236 --> 01:14:05,405
One other thing.
Don't think anymore.

755
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:07,707

around here.

[ yori ]
this isn't going to be easy.

757

If those grid bugs get us,
we've had it.

758
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,476
Had enough ?

759
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:45,812
What do you want ?
I'm busy.

Busy dying, you worn out
excuse for an old program.

761
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:51,718
Yes, I'm old.

762
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:55,522
Old enough to remember the mcp
when it was a chess program.

763
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:58,158
<i>He started small,
and he'll end small.</i>

764
01:14:58,225 --> 01:15:02,362
Very funny, dumont.
Maybe I should keep you around
just to make me laugh.

765
01:15:13,207 --> 01:15:15,675
What's happening ?
Power surge in the mcp.

   get off this beam.
 - I can't.</i>

767
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,346
There isn't another junction
for seven or eight nanoseconds.

768
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:23,783
- there's another beam !
- it's too far.

769
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,704
He's creating a junction.

770
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:09,562
Did we make it ?

771
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,564
Yeah.

772
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:13,767
Hurray for our side.

773
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,226
Is he de-rezzing ?

774
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:43,530
<i>No, but I couldn't
tell you why not.</i>

775
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:49,335
I'm all in one piece.

776
01:16:49,403 --> 01:16:51,571
I guess
I'm still with you.

777
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:57,210
[ groans ]
tell the guy with
the jackhammer to lay off.

778
01:16:57,278 --> 01:17:00,246
- how'd you do that ?
- elementary physics--

779
01:17:00,314 --> 01:17:02,248
A beam of energy
can always be diverted.

780
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:04,551
Are we there yet, mommy ?

781
01:17:58,906 --> 01:18:01,007
Sark !

782
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:17,657
Dumont !
Yori !

783
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,427
Tron ?

784
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:25,398
Tron's dead.

785
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:30,804
Who's that ?
That is a user, dumont.

786
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:34,374
He came here to help us.

787
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:37,877
Tron believed in him.

788
01:18:39,146 --> 01:18:42,415
If the users can no longer
help us, we're lost.

789
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:45,218
So, we have erased
that program--

790
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:47,187
No.

791
01:18:47,254 --> 01:18:50,089
<i>- you were de-rezzed.
 - not me, sark.</i>

792
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:53,426
There's nothing
special about you.
You're just an ordinary program.

793
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:56,196
So are you, one that
should have been erased.

794
01:18:56,263 --> 01:18:58,898
You're nothing.

795
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:02,035
Take that program
to the holding pit.

796
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:13,279
Please, don't take--

797
01:19:13,347 --> 01:19:15,281
<i>I'm taking
our friend here...</i>

798
01:19:15,382 --> 01:19:18,284
And some other religious
fanatics to master control.

799
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:21,888
When I disembark,

800
01:19:21,956 --> 01:19:24,991
This ship and everything
that remains on board...

801
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:27,594
Will automatically de-rezz.

802
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:32,932
This means you.

803
01:19:38,672 --> 01:19:40,573
Move on !

804
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:11,104
Immediate vectors
detached.

805
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:13,106
Route us
to the mcp.

806
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:15,575
I want to get rid
of this dead weight,

807
01:20:15,643 --> 01:20:18,244
And catch a transport beam
to the game domain.

808
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:31,524
These walls--
yori, something's happening.

809
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:34,387
Hey.

810
01:21:35,756 --> 01:21:38,858
You all right ?

811
01:21:38,926 --> 01:21:41,427
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.

812
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,864
Leave me alone.
We've failed.

813
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:48,535
We're only gonna fail
if we give up !
Come on, look, the wall !

814
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,539
Yori.

815
01:22:00,581 --> 01:22:03,550
You brought me back.

816
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:04,017
How ?  Why did
you bring me back ?

817
01:22:06,912 --> 01:22:09,114
I need your help.
Come on !

818
01:22:38,944 --> 01:22:40,979
Do something with
these controls !

819
01:22:41,046 --> 01:22:43,481
I'm on it.

820
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:45,416
The mcp, it's the heart
of the whole system.

821
01:23:09,508 --> 01:23:13,178
I feel a presence.
Another warrior is on the mesa.

822
01:23:16,215 --> 01:23:18,116
[ tron ]
sark !

823
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,488
We're getting closer.

824
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,093
I don't know
how you survived.

825
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:32,330
<i>Slave,
it doesn't matter.</i>

826
01:23:32,431 --> 01:23:35,667
Prepare to terminate.

827
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:50,815
All programs have
a desire to be useful.

828
01:23:50,883 --> 01:23:53,818
But in moments, you will
no longer seek communication...

829
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:57,722
<i>With each other or
your superfluous users.</i>

830
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:01,559
You will each be part of me.
Together, we will be complete.

831
01:24:08,901 --> 01:24:11,870
You should have joined me.
We'd have made a great team.

832
01:24:15,774 --> 01:24:19,144
- you're very persistent.
- I'm also better than you.

833
01:24:33,592 --> 01:24:35,860
[ mcp ]
sark ?

834
01:24:35,928 --> 01:24:39,764
All my functions are
now yours.  Take them.

835
01:24:41,767 --> 01:24:43,334
Sark ?

836
01:24:47,139 --> 01:24:48,907
Sark ?

837
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:57,482
Look at that !

838
01:25:12,498 --> 01:25:16,334
Your user can't
help you now,
my little program.

839
01:25:27,313 --> 01:25:29,714
I got it.
Steer us over by the beam.

840
01:25:29,782 --> 01:25:31,883
Right next to it.

841
01:25:31,951 --> 01:25:34,519
What good will that do ?

842
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,521
I'm gonna jump.

843
01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:40,325
It's the only way
to help tron.

844
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:42,327
Don't.
You'll be de-rezzed.

845
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:03,014
Don't worry.

846
01:27:10,316 --> 01:27:13,384
Come on, let's go !

847
01:27:56,028 --> 01:27:58,096
We did it !

848
01:28:07,239 --> 01:28:09,174
That's nice.

849
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:12,277
We thought you
were dead.

850
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:14,612
Where's flynn ?
It was incredible.

851
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,215
He threw himself into the beam
and distracted the mcp...

852
01:28:17,283 --> 01:28:20,351
Just long enough for you
to get the disk in.

853
01:28:20,419 --> 01:28:23,188
He saved us.
He really did it.

854
01:28:23,255 --> 01:28:26,257
<i>Video warriors,
look at the I/o towers.</i>

855
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:31,596
Every tower
is lighting up.

856
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:27,185
<i>Priority one !</i>

Try to look official.
Here comes the boss.

859
01:30:43,729 --> 01:30:46,764
Pick me up in an hour.
Thanks.
