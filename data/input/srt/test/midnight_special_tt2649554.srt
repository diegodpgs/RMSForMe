News Center 35 night team.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,288
Good evening. Thanks for tuning in to your news at 6:00.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,091
A breaking story for Central Texas tonight.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,210
Police issued an AMBER Alert for an 8-year-old boy.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,251
He was abducted from his home near Eldorado, Texas, last night.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,529
We don't have a photo of him yet, but this is what we do know.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,250
His name is Alton Meyer.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,166
He is eight years old, white, with blue eyes and brown hair,

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,526
4 '8" tall,

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,324
- weighing roughly 60 pounds.
- It's time.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,690
Meyer's parents reported him missing Sunday night

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,810
and believe this man, Roy Tomlin, took him.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,362
We are awaiting details on Tomlin,

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,363
but police say he may be armed

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,603
and should be considered extremely dangerous.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,446
If you have any information, please call 911 immediately.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,048
Again, we haven't been provided with a photo of the 8-year-old,

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,762
but he is white, eight years old, 4'8" tall,

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,806
weighing roughly 60 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes.

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,407
Said to be traveling with this man, Roy Tomlin.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,526
Please call 911 with any information.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,485
We will keep you updated as we receive more.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,970
It's time. You ready?

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,086
Yeah.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,249
Better lose the bed sheet.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,401
Okay.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,565
...between planning meetings

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,370
that two consecutive overpasses

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,810
would not be knocked down during the I-35 expansion project.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,407
And, more than anything, Ross leaders say they would've appreciated

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,607
- a heads up.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,922
A TxDOT spokesperson says

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,765
the school district and the EMS were notified,

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,486
but the Ross mayor and fire chiefs were not.

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,931
He has more on that.

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,366
The I-35 project...

51
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,251
Attention, all units,

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,726
for a wanted person broadcast.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,406
Be on the lookout for a 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle,

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,851
primer gray in color, bearing Texas license plate 159AG2,

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,565
driven by two white males

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,762
- heading eastbound on I-30.
- P op that open.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,490
Subjects are known to carry firearms.

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,729
Any unit coming into contact, hold and notify.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,365
Hand me those goggles.

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,487
Kill the light, Alton.

61
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,401
Again, no photos have been

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,489
provided of the 8-year-old boy.

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,049
He is White, 4'8" tall,

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,647
weighing roughly 60 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes,

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,929
said to be traveling with this man, Roy Tomlin.

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,924
Please call 911 with any information.

67
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,486
Stay with us after the break...

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,684
What, did the Ranch put this out?

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,290
No. This is something else.

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,284
Thank you, Levi.

71
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,284
What you do now will decide our whole way of life.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,970
You have four days to get the boy back here.

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,443
He won't give him up easily.

74
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,811
But we must get him back in time, you understand?

75
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,246
The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.

76
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,966
Peace be to you.

77
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,610
And to you.

78
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,802
We'll begin with the reading from March 17th, 2011.

79
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,286
"Gulf Eclipse and the numbers came."

80
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,605
35,

81
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,321
47, 97, 52.

82
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,526
"Buildings tower. The light comes.

83
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,365
"To know the source of such things is to know our place in the world."

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,447
We're guarded by a plan unknown to us, but...

85
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,445
Friends, these gentlemen are from the federal government.

86
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,807
I'd suggest you listen to them very carefully.

87
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,287
Please remain calm.

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,124
We are agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

89
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,969
We have a warrant to search the premises and detain all members of this Ranch.

90
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,691
There are buses waiting outside to transport you

91
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,723
to the campus of Jefferson High School

92
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,291
- in San Angelo.

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,046
Please exit the building in an orderly fashion.

94
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,725
- Stand up, please.
- You will receive

95
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,042
further details when we reach our destination.

96
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,601
FBI AGENT 1". Will y'all stand up, please?

97
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,801
Bring it this way.

98
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,961
Yes, ma'am. You, too.

99
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,731
Are we good?

100
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
It's better to get across state line.

101
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,844
We passed three counties. I'd like to slow down.

102
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,681
Lucas!

103
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,691
Alton, stay down.

104
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,721
Ma'am.

105
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,361
Ma'am?

106
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,564
She's hurt real bad!

107
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,762
She's gonna need an ambulance. She got a bad head wound.

108
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,927
Don't.

109
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,441
Shoot him.

110
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,926
Get back in the car.

111
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,565
Alton is more important.

112
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,889
Get back in the car!

113
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,724
- Shoot him!
- I got this!

114
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,728
Shot fired. Officer down.

115
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,003
Send medical, 10-18.

116
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,768
County Road 36, one mile east of marker 87.

117
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,730
Copy that-Will notify.

118
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,961
Everything's fine. You buckled in?

119
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,001
It's okay. Just settle down, all right?

120
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,641
You want your comics? Here.

121
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,729
He had on a vest.

122
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,530
You didn't know that.

123
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,249
You did the right thing. He's more important.

124
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,926
You didn't just shoot a state trooper.

125
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,044
Inside to the right.

126
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,446
Please. Ma 'am, please step forward.

127
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,050
We've had you under surveillance

128
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,562
since members of your Ranch have acquired a sizeable number of firearms

129
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,404
over the course of the last six months.

130
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,602
Do you have an explanation for this?

131
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,563
Well, it's not illegal to own weapons in this country yet.

132
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,248
What's the main economic function of your Ranch?

133
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,927
We have pasture land. Cattle, dairy.

134
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,447
But they're not for profit.

135
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,005
- We use them ourselves.

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,331
S EVI E RI Hi. Hello.

137
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,925
Hi. Sorry. Agent Miller?

138
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,925
Hi. Paul Sevier, NSA.

139
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,521
Nice to finally meet you in person. Hello.

140
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,321
As I said, my name is Paul Sevier.

141
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,209
I work for the NSA in the field of communications.

142
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,966
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I just kind of jump in or...

143
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,244
Do these mean anything to you?

144
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,841
Ignoring the rest of this. Polo Step?

145
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,690
Meridian Alpha?

146
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,966
Red Saber?

147
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,329
The number combination

148
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,767
53, 23, 77, 127?

149
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,849
Yes. They're excerpts from my sermons.

150
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,003
That particular one's from a reading,

151
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,401
January 18th, 2010.

152
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,325
Yes, it is. Did you write this?

153
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,161
Yes.

154
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,090
What if I told you that the words and numbers contained in your sermons

155
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,049
include sensitive government information

156
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,089
that, given the dates you provide,

157
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,608
were transmitted solely by satellite through a heavily encrypted format?

158
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,683
The decryption and dissemination of which,

159
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,161
other than being scientifically impossible,

160
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,886
would surely carry punishments of treason that are so severe,

161
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,884
the government probably hasn't invented them yet.

162
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,002
They came from the boy. It's all from the boy.

163
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,288
- Alton Meyer?
- Yes.

164
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,886
Okay, well, we knew that.

165
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,246
He's your son?

166
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,051
Adopted.

167
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,486
Do you know the birth father?

168
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,926
Yes, I do.

169
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,884
Roy Tomlin.

170
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,082
So can you tell us how an 8-year-old got this information?

171
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,560
He would have fits.

172
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,401
Can you explain that?

173
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,567
He would speak in tongues.

174
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,244
Sometimes other languages, sometimes unknown languages.

175
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,085
We wrote them down. They became our scripture.

176
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,050
These are words of the Lord.

177
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,049
Or the federal government.

178
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,051
What's the significance of Friday, March 6th?

179
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,362
We need to know where he is.

180
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,089
Y'all have no clue what you're dealing with, do you?

181
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,283
I prepared a room for him.

182
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,562
Alton, it's wonderful to see you again.

183
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,321
Yes, sir.

184
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,210
Are those windows blacked out?

185
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,681
Yes, there's cardboard behind the drapes.

186
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,404
Well, I'll... I'll let y'all get settled in.

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,686
ROY". Thank you.

188
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,085
Kick your shoes off.

189
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,690
Get some sleep, Alton.

190
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,321
Good night, Lucas.

191
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,841
Goggles.

192
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,730
Try and sleep.

193
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,922
We'll have breakfast when you get up.

194
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,406
Okay.

195
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,522
Stop what you're doing for one second

196
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,808
and take a look at your screen right now.

197
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,166
Look at his picture.

198
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,566
This man, Roy Tomlin,

199
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,929
wanted in connection with an AMBER Alert out this morning

200
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,647
for an 8-year-old little boy, Alton Meyer.

201
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,245
LUCAS". It's national.

202
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,926
What about the state trooper?

203
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,085
Nothing.

204
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,969
I can't believe the Ranch released this.

205
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,930
...near San Angelo, Texas. That was two nights ago.

206
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,605
I don't think they did.

207
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,569
The two are said to be traveling east into Arkansas,

208
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,404
possibly into Louisiana.

209
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,403
The man last seen driving a black...

210
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,564
I'll take the first watch. You need to sleep.

211
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,163
- You need anything?
- A drink.

212
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,367
You got it.

213
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,404
Do not approach him. Don't try to apprehend him.

214
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,681
...If you've seen this guy,

215
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,081
please call 911 immediately.

216
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,001
Hey-

217
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,768
lam in this for Alton. All the way.

218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,010
Things with that trooper didn't need to go down like that.

219
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,330
He's a little boy. Brown hair, blue eyes.

220
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,130
Don't interfere with me again.

221
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,489
Roy Tomlin is said to have some sort of a relationship to the boy's family,

222
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,611
but the details of that relationship, extremely unclear.

223
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,441
We're gonna bring you the latest on the case in the next hour,

224
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,285
and give you everything through the night.

225
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,727
I've got something I want you to see.

226
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,289
Has anyone else from the Ranch decoded the coordinates you gave me?

227
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,687
No.

228
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,564
They only have the date.

229
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,641
Well...

230
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,970
The place is clear.

231
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,843
But I still don't have an answer as to why that place.

232
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,969
Have you ever done any studying on the concept of ley lines?

233
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,281
No.

234
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,690
Well, their validity is arguable, but I got to tell you, in the research...

235
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,161
Elden. I'm tired.

236
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,211
Of course.

237
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,290
Do you miss it?

238
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,409
Living on the Ranch?

239
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,166
Yeah.

240
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,970
Very much.

241
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,046
Lucas!

242
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,121
Alton!

243
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,921
Stop!

244
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,121
No!

245
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,121
No!

246
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,484
I got you. I got you. I got you.

247
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,723
...It's okay. It's okay.

248
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,321
ROY". It's okay.

249
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,121
It's okay.

250
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,129
HANNAH". Things would break.

251
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,844
What kinds of things?

252
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,850
Windows, light bulbs.

253
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,731
Cars would shut down. That kind of thing.

254
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,801
It just got worse the older he got,

255
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,323
so they just started letting him sleep in the daytime,

256
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,323
and he'd be awake at night.

257
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,891
It's why all our services are at night now.

258
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,005
And what's your job on the Ranch?

259
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,366
Childcare.

260
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,730
I help look after all of Brother Calvin's children.

261
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,202
Alton's been with him over two years now.

262
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,844
And the birth mother?

263
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,250
She abandoned him.

264
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,760
FREDRKZK'. Yes, I'm done.

265
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,285
Communing?

266
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,124
That's what we call it.

267
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,970
To be clear,

268
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,724
"A visible spectrum of light came from his eyes."

269
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,441
Yes.

270
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,242
And others have described seeing things.

271
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,607
Did he show you things during this process?

272
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,761
Yes.

273
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,168
What kinds of things?

274
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,969
I wouldn't know where to start.

275
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,851
And Friday, March 6th. Why is this date important?

276
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,363
It's the day of ourjudgment.

277
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,244
What makes you say that?

278
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,609
Ibeheveit.

279
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,447
It wasn't images.

280
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,929
Not what I remember.

281
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,604
It was more...

282
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,442
It was like a feeling.

283
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,607
What kind of feeling?

284
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,281
Comfort.

285
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,484
And

286
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,126
what do you think will happen on Friday, March 6th?

287
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,202
If Alton is with us, we will be saved.

288
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,444
Barbara Meyer?

289
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,651
This way.

290
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,761
All right. I need everyone to stand up.

291
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,684
Exit through the front doors, please.

292
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,929
Single file, please. Thank you.

293
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,167
Lucas, can you get Alton in the van?

294
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,881
Yeah.

295
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,326
We're taking your van.

296
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,125
Please don't.

297
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,762
You know where we're going.

298
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,481
Please.

299
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,770
I had to see again.

300
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,009
You knew better.

301
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,204
Liberty 285. Code 6.

302
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,289
105 North Avenue, 52.

303
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,370
ROY". We need to stop for gas.

304
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,168
We could use some supplies.

305
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,685
I'll go in.

306
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,565
The less people that see you, the better.

307
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,688
I need to use the payphone.

308
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,250
What's Kryptonite?

309
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,641
It's the only thing that'll kill Superman.

310
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,370
ROY". It's made-up.

311
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,565
I should have never let you give him those.

312
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,245
He's never seen a comic book in his life.

313
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,043
That's why he needs them. Reading's reading.

314
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,602
He needs to know what's real.

315
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,651
He looks weaker.

316
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,121
He is.

317
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,766
He recovers?

318
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
He's fine.

319
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,725
He speaks Spanish?

320
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,924
It's something he does. Turn on the radio.

321
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,170
Scroll through the stations.

322
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,800
Be right back.

323
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,967
Stay in the van.

324
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,441
Hey-

325
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,530
Yeah, we're okay. We should be there in a couple hours.

326
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,971
WOMAN". Are you okay?

327
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,570
I've been wanting to see you.

328
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,801
Mmm-hmm.

329
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,011
We'll be there soon.

330
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,762
Why are you wearing those goggles?

331
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,160
Stop! Stop!

332
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,044
He's with me. He's my son.

333
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,728
Yeah, well, you ought to watch your kid.

334
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,609
Yeah, I got it. Thank you.

335
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,445
Everything okay?

336
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,321
You cannot leave the van. You hear me?

337
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,121
I'm sorry.

338
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,448
It's okay. I shouldn't have left you.

339
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,320
No.

340
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,246
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,286
Roy?

342
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,361
"Go!

343
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,081
Dad?

344
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,728
Alton. Lean your head back.

345
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,450
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

346
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,286
Roy.

347
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,488
Roy, do we need to get him to a hospital?

348
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,284
No! No! Just keep driving.

349
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,329
Is this something that he does?

350
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,766
It's okay.

351
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,207
It's okay.

352
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,607
Alton.

353
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,490
Thank you, God.

354
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,445
Thank you.

355
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,850
Let me look at you.

356
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,286
You're so big.

357
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,805
So grown-up.

358
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,570
- Hello.
- Hi.

359
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,686
I'm Sarah.

360
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,601
Lucas.

361
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,845
How are you?

362
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,450
I missed him.

363
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,201
Come On.

364
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,850
Y'all must be exhausted.

365
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,170
Let's go inside.

366
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,083
I got a present for you, Alton.

367
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,890
You wanna see your room?

368
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,485
I can't keep my eyes off him.

369
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,524
Get some rest.

370
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,001
Okay.

371
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,766
He okay?

372
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,204
He doesn't look good.

373
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,245
He's sick.

374
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,081
He's getting weaker, but he'll be okay.

375
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,084
Should we do something?

376
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,080
Just stick to the plan and get him there by Friday.

377
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,282
Do you think that's wise?

378
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,771
It's all we have.

379
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,127
This date and place is everything.

380
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,123
We take him to a hospital, it's over.

381
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,930
But if it's between that and him dying?

382
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,086
It's three days. He'll make it.

383
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,530
I think he's right.

384
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,006
Yeah.

385
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,964
I don't know if there's a way out of all this for y'all,

386
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,929
but it's a shame.

387
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,641
You would have made a nice family otherwise.

388
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,442
I'm an electrician.

389
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,288
Certified in two states.

390
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,121
What do I know about these things?

391
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,686
He wouldn't have asked you if you couldn't do it.

392
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,402
Sometimes we are asked to do things that are beyond us.

393
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,001
Yes?

394
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,562
Are you Sarah Tomlin's mother?

395
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,482
How could someone cause a satellite to fall out of orbit?

396
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,645
I don't know. Ask an engineer.

397
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,681
Well...

398
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,484
Alton Meyer brought down an Air Force satellite last night.

399
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,323
DSP-9712.

400
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,490
- It was tasked with detecting a...
- Nuclear explosion.

401
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,201
Yeah.

402
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,528
This is the last image sent to us by the satellite.

403
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,566
We believe that's the boy standing at the center of the heat bloom.

404
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,529
It's not exactly a heat bloom, but that's fine.

405
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,490
Well, whatever it is, it set off a satellite

406
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,849
whose sole purpose is detecting a nuclear event.

407
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,164
No radiation.

408
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,166
None.

409
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,489
Could a drone be programmed

410
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,961
to search for that specific heat signature?

411
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,881
Yeah.

412
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,126
We've got a field office in Mobile you can base your team out of.

413
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,728
- What about the interviews?
- You're done with those.

414
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,407
Like it or not, you're the new resident expert on Alton Meyer.

415
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,005
Let's go.

416
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,521
Breaking news at this hour.

417
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,844
A weather satellite fell from space and crashed near a gas station.

418
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,566
This happened overnight in northern Louisiana,

419
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,849
and as we speak, a massive cleanup is underway

420
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,364
because the debris field from the crash is nearly 60 miles wide.

421
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,008
The Canadian company that owns this satellite

422
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,322
says the spacecraft suffered mechanical failure...

423
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,925
Can you tell Lucas to pull the van around back?

424
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,483
Okay.

425
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,531
It is the first time that debris has fallen in a populated area.

426
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,765
Our local affiliate has more from the area hardest hit by this falling debris.

427
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,571
Roy asked if you'd pull the van around back when you're done.

428
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,606
Okay.

429
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,171
You're not from the Ranch?

430
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,729
No. No.

431
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,963
Then how do you know Roy?

432
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,805
We grew up together.

433
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,607
We were real close for a long time,

434
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,005
till his parents moved him out to the Ranch, and then we fell off.

435
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,450
Until three nights ago, there was a knock at my door,

436
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,491
and there's Roy standing there with Alton.

437
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,767
He says that they're in trouble and they need help.

438
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,445
And then Alton sat me down.

439
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,126
And he took those goggles off.

440
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,691
You know when that boy does that...

441
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,162
That thing with his eyes...

442
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,845
It's powerful.

443
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,922
What do you do in San Angelo?

444
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,763
I'm a state trooper.

445
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,046
Alton?

446
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,321
Alton?

447
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,841
Yes?

448
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,607
What happened at the gas station?

449
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,603
Did you mean to do that?

450
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,561
Yes.

451
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,241
Why?

452
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,320
They were watching me.

453
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,928
Who was watching you, Alton?

454
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,560
The police.

455
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,363
Well, how do you know it was the police?

456
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,561
They talk like the police on your radio.

457
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,770
What do they say?

458
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,124
They're looking for me.

459
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,680
Here's a receipt for her car insurance.

460
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,161
Isuzu Rodeo, '99.

461
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,003
There's a van in the driveway.

462
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,401
See if it's got a registration in it.

463
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,481
Alton.

464
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,846
Alton. Breathe. Can you breathe?

465
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,611
- Roy!
- Pull over.

466
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,649
- Breathe!
- Pull over!

467
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,250
Breathe! Breathe!

468
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,440
Breathe.

469
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,523
Okay, Okay-

470
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,487
What is it?

471
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,641
Mom?

472
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,921
I'm okay.

473
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,121
Ahhh!

474
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,327
Mom?

475
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,045
4scREAMs) %GROANS)

476
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,161
God.

477
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,201
Alton.

478
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,566
...Alton!

479
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,643
Water! He needs water.

480
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,761
Oh, my God.

481
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,321
Alton.

482
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,287
Roy.

483
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,121
He needs water.

484
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,364
We need to take him to a hospital!

485
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,524
- No.
- He's dying.

486
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,931
Hey, hey!

487
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,889
- He is sick, right?
- No!

488
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,805
He's dying! ROY". No! He will not die!

489
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,530
He is meant for something else!

490
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,091
No, he's sick and he needs help!

491
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,041
Alton?

492
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,044
We have to go. They're coming.

493
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,325
Who's coming?

494
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,321
There.

495
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,889
You take the car with Lucas.

496
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,083
Dad, we have to go.

497
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,760
That way.

498
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,921
Now!

499
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,526
Roy... Roy!

500
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,726
What the hell?

501
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

502
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,211
I can run.

503
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,961
This way.

504
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,441
Alton.

505
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,321
How did you know this was here?

506
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,121
I didn't.

507
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,361
Sun will be up in a few hours.

508
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,449
We can wait out the daylight here.

509
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,566
Alton!

510
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,961
Here.

511
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,091
I'm okay.

512
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,410
I'm sorry.

513
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,886
No.

514
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,689
I need something.

515
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,686
What?

516
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,005
I need to be awake during the day.

517
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,321
In the sun.

518
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,406
You can't.

519
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,846
Ihaveto.

520
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,564
It could kill you.

521
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,560
Dad...

522
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,250
lhaveto.

523
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,762
He's not going to Atlanta.

524
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,606
What?

525
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,685
All these places mentioned in the sermons, they don't matter.

526
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,922
They don't?

527
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,124
No, he's just listening to the government talk.

528
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,082
He's just looking for a language to describe a location,

529
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,083
and all he heard was coordinates.

530
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,690
That's remarkable.

531
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,846
Now they wanna move us to an office in Atlanta.

532
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,650
Doesn't matter.

533
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,801
What?

534
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,769
I know where they're going.

535
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,481
Old habits die hard?

536
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,882
You still staying up nights?

537
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,887
What happened to your head, Elden?

538
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,086
...then warming up a bit

539
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,731
this afternoon, with a few sunny breaks

540
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,041
and diminishing...

541
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,084
So you can go one full year...

542
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,044
This is the part that people need to be aware of.

543
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,401
- Everybody out...

544
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,885
Roy will get him here.

545
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,209
If he's not dead.

546
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,126
I'm sorry.

547
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,329
Roy won't let that happen.

548
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,369
Yeah, I hope not.

549
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,609
He believes in something. You don't.

550
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,930
It doesn't matter.

551
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,084
Good people die every day believing in things.

552
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,084
Roy spent two years watching another man raise our son.

553
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,084
He did what I couldn't.

554
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,681
He'll do anything to get him here.

555
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,448
Better get some rest.

556
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,487
Nobody's coming with the sun up.

557
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,886
Dad.

558
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,291
It's okay.

559
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,807
Dad.

560
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,529
It's still daylight.

561
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,806
Jesus.

562
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,165
He looks...

563
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,204
He has something to tell you.

564
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,963
You look wonderful.

565
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,130
It's still daylight.

566
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,046
Yeah.

567
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,049
No... No goggles.

568
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,644
Lucas, you wanna sit down?

569
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,922
I saw the sunrise this morning.

570
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,801
I think I know what I am now.

571
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,566
There's...

572
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,605
There's a world

573
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,562
built on top of ours.

574
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,969
People live there.

575
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,487
I think they're like me.

576
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,165
We saw it.

577
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,969
They're like you?

578
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,284
Yes, I think so.

579
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,284
I understand.

580
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,366
Lucas?

581
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,210
I believe you.

582
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,721
Good.

583
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,971
All right.

584
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,562
- You all right in there?
- Yeah.

585
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,000
Roy?

586
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,769
I need to talk to you.

587
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,561
Okay.

588
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,091
It's about tomorrow.

589
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,844
The world you saw,

590
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,763
it didn't last very long.

591
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,451
Seconds.

592
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,928
SARAH". And then he got better.

593
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,246
Yeah.

594
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,289
What are you asking?

595
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,045
What if Alton doesn't belong with us?

596
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,642
We need to consider that,

597
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,610
come tomorrow,

598
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,010
he may be gone.

599
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,045
I'm out.

600
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,881
So you had never seen the sunrise?

601
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,287
No.

602
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,606
Did you like it?

603
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,170
What color was it?

604
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,800
It was first red, then it was orange.

605
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,121
Okay.

606
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,691
So, then you just walked out...

607
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,041
%GROANS)

608
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,321
Alton! Alton!

609
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,410
- Get down!
- No, no.

610
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,641
That's enough. Don't you move.

611
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,080
- Stay down.
- No!

612
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,561
No!

613
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,360
No!

614
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,250
No! No!

615
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,644
No! No, no!

616
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,171
- Alton!
- No!

617
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,321
Mom!

618
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,160
Mom!

619
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,441
Alton!

620
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,967
No.

621
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,204
- Dad!
- No!

622
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,928
No! No!

623
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,406
No!

624
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,242
Doak, don't. Please.

625
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,646
- Roy!
- No!

626
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,524
Stop! Stop!

627
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,046
- Stop!
- Hey.

628
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,202
My boot. In my boot.

629
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,043
Get me out! Get me out!

630
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,081
Go!

631
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,210
Man, I'm sorry, Roy.

632
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,490
I just didn't see them coming.

633
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,521
Back on the road, guys.

634
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,684
Hey, asshole!

635
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,609
Back on the road now!

636
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,361
Roy!

637
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,125
FBI,

638
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,243
CIA, Homeland Security...

639
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,529
Someone has him. Someone knows where he is.

640
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,010
And the FBI have field offices.

641
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,764
Now, we could start there...

642
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,649
We won't find him.

643
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,805
He's gone.

644
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,969
The only thing I ever believed in was Alton.

645
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,530
And I failed him.

646
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,768
Hello, Alton. My name is Sharon Davison.

647
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,922
I'm a childhood development counselor.

648
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,766
I consult with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

649
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,849
but I'm not in law enforcement.

650
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,486
I need to ask you some questions, okay?

651
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,325
There was a crash at a gas station you were at.

652
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,845
Do you remember that?

653
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,803
Who has been with you the last few days?

654
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,929
Have you been with your father?

655
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,163
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

656
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,691
Paul.

657
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,565
Who is that?

658
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,241
I want to talk to Paul Sevier.

659
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,682
- My name is... Paul Sevier.

660
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,567
Lead Operations Analyst.

661
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,807
They just gave me that title.

662
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,925
Who is this guy?

663
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,204
He's NSA.

664
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,486
What, uh...

665
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,404
The place that you and your father were trying to get to,

666
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,891
what's the significance of that location?

667
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,963
I will only speak with him.

668
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,889
Okay, everybody out.

669
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,085
Just get the information.

670
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,208
Okay, so where do we start?

671
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,962
That's impressive.

672
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,251
You know, I have to say,

673
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,846
I've really been looking forward to meeting you.

674
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,888
They think you're a weapon.

675
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,005
I'm not.

676
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,241
And the Ranch thinks you're their savior.

677
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,562
I'm not any of those things.

678
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,247
I belong in another world.

679
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,723
There are people there.

680
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,803
They watch us.

681
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,689
They've been watching us for a very long time.

682
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,767
I need to go where I belong.

683
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,284
Where you belong?

684
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,841
Hello?

685
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,480
- Is this Roy Tomlin?
- Yes.

686
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,049
I have your son.

687
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,525
Yes, he's fine. I'm bringing him to you.

688
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,763
Do you have something to write with?

689
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,207
Okay.

690
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,241
Alton!

691
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,526
Ready?

692
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,890
29 degrees, 4 minutes, 31 seconds north,

693
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:43,091
82 degrees, 41 minutes, 48 seconds west.

694
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,844
I'll have him there in four hours. Goodbye.

695
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,366
What about the backup generator?

696
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,966
They've all failed. I've never seen anything like it.

697
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,286
And the exits?

698
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,125
We have three. The gates to each one were open.

699
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,521
We can't get them closed without power.

700
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,487
Let's move out.

701
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,644
All right, moving out! Let's get this place cleaned up right away!

702
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,801
Move! Move!

703
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,689
You over there, take that side.

704
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,649
Let's go. Move it, move it, move it!

705
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,643
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

706
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,966
SARAH; AI.

707
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,369
I decoded the same patterns you found in the sermons.

708
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,329
They know where you're going.

709
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,011
Everything will be blocked off for 5 miles.

710
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,884
You won't get through.

711
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,445
I can help.

712
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,451
Come on.

713
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,291
Can I come with you?

714
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,486
No.

715
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,170
Thank you.

716
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,851
Are those handcuffs?

717
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,762
I mean, obviously they're handcuffs.

718
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,082
You're Lucas, right? The state trooper?

719
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,290
Do you mind?

720
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,850
All right, thank you.

721
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,726
Too much to ask for you to punch me in the face?

722
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,649
You know, forget it. Never mind. Thank you.

723
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,369
Needs to be tighter.

724
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,565
Lift your arms up.

725
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,131
How's that feel?

726
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,361
Good.

727
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,683
- Dad?
- Yeah?

728
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,210
Are you scared?

729
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,201
Yes.

730
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,882
You don't have to worry about me.

731
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,122
I like worrying about you.

732
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,122
You don't have to anymore.

733
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,691
I'll always worry about you, Alton.

734
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,370
That's the deal.

735
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,089
Can you get this on?

736
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,844
We're gonna have to move fast once we stop.

737
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,490
I understand.

738
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,122
There has to be a better way in.

739
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,890
There's not.

740
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,364
We can do this alone.

741
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,969
You've done enough for us.

742
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,966
No.

743
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,369
Are you driving?

744
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,125
This is it.

745
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,566
You sure?

746
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,084
It has the fewest soldiers.

747
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,729
Get down on the floor.

748
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,721
Cover him up.

749
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,283
LUCAS". No room on the shoulder.

750
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,406
Water.

751
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,320
They've seen you.

752
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,811
Yeah, we know.

753
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,004
- Don't shoot!

754
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,650
They can only return fire!

755
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,521
- We're okay.
- Eyes on target.

756
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,046
We all right?

757
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,281
Yeah.

758
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,201
Here!

759
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,881
Alton!

760
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,206
Okay.

761
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,401
The steering's going.

762
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,487
The tread comes off those tires, it's gonna get a lot harder.

763
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,000
Can't keep this up.

764
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,326
You alive?

765
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,047
Could we go back to Texas now?

766
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,809
And you say here that he got out of the car

767
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,610
with the birth mother, Sarah Adams.

768
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:15,881
Yes.

769
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,290
Where is she now?

770
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,283
Your guess is as good as mine.

771
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,410
So you think they just walked away?

772
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,085
I didn't say that.

773
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,321
Well, then...

774
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,411
Just explain to me how,

775
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,723
with multiple types of aerial and ground surveillance

776
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,450
surrounding the area,

777
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,484
they could simply walk away undetected.

778
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,131
I don't know.

779
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,051
But if he didn't want you to see him,

780
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,565
you wouldn't see him.

781
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,649
I could tell it to you as many times as you want.

782
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,485
My story's not changing because it's true.

783
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,526
You know.

784
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,807
Y'all saw the same shit I saw.

785
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,329
But keep asking me if you want to.

786
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,806
I'm done.

787
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:11,402
They've sent in a specialist to speak with you.

788
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,722
I suggest that you answer him more fully.

789
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,526
Hello.

790
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,769
My name's Paul Sevier.
