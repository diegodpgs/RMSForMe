1
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,268
Gentlemen, cock your pistols.

2
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,732
Gentlemen!

3
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,862
Barry's father had been bred, like
many sons of genteel families...

4
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,531
...to the profession of the law.

5
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:18,786
There is no doubt he would've made
an eminent figure in his profession...

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,663
...had he not been killed in a duel...

7
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,084
...which arose over the
purchase of some horses.

8
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,268
Barry's mother, after
her husband's death...

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,480
...lived in such a
way as to defy slander.

10
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,819
Many a man who had been
charmed by the spinster...

11
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,154
...renewed his offers to the widow.

12
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,325
But she refused all
proposals of marriage...

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,995
...declaring that she
lived only for her son...

14
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,998
...and the memory of her departed saint.

15
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,014
First love! What a
change it makes in a lad.

16
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,685
What a magnificent secret
it is he carries with him!

17
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,774
The tender passion gushes
out of a man's heart.

18
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,612
He loves as a bird sings...

19
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,865
...or a rose blows from nature.

20
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,535
Killarney.

21
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,540
Now, what shall it be?

22
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,671
Turn around and face the wall.

23
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,017
The object of Barry's attention...

24
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,770
...and the cause of
his early troubles...

25
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,357
...was his cousin, Nora Brady by name.

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,623
I have hidden my neck ribbon
somewhere on my person.

27
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,543
If you find it, you can have it.

28
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,964
You are free to look anywhere for it.

29
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,550
I will think little of
you if you do not find it.

30
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,621
I cannot find it.

31
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,084
You haven't looked properly.

32
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,433
I cannot find it.

33
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,482
I'll give you a hint.

34
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,920
I feel the ribbon.

35
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,635
Why are you trembling?

36
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,098
<i>At...</i>

37
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,602
At the pleasure of finding the ribbon.

38
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,777
Liar.

39
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:23,382
Company, forward march!

40
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,673
Company, eyes left!

41
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:12,097
About this time the United
Kingdom was greatly excited...

42
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,516
...by the threat...

43
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,476
...of a French invasion.

44
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,105
The noblemen and people of condition...

45
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,357
...loyally raised regiments...

46
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,402
...to resist the invaders.

47
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,283
Their scarlet coats and swaggering
airs filled Barry with envy.

48
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,543
Company, eyes right!

49
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,718
Brady Town sent a company to join...

50
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,972
...the Kilwangan Regiment, of
which John Quin was the Captain.

51
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,811
The whole country was
alive with war's alarms...

52
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,982
...the kingdoms ringing
with military music.

53
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,698
At ready!

54
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,870
Present!

55
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,207
Fire!

56
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,627
Redmond, what is the matter?

57
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,136
Were you obliged to dance
five times with Captain Quin?

58
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,723
I don't care a fig for Captain Quin.

59
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,311
He dances prettily, and is
a pleasant rattle of a man.

60
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,688
He looks well in his regimentals.

61
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,482
He asked me to dance.
How could I refuse him?

62
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,192
But you refused me.

63
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,445
I can dance with you any day.

64
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,450
To dance with my cousin looks as
though I could find no other partner.

65
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,121
Besides, Captain Quin is a man.

66
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,000
You're only a boy and penniless.

67
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,630
If I meet him again, you will
find out who is the best man.

68
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,466
I'll fight him Captain as he is.

69
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,259
Oh, don't be so silly!

70
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,719
I mean it.

71
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,514
But Captain Quin is known
as a valiant soldier.

72
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,018
It is mighty well of
you to fight yokels...

73
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,021
...but to fight an Englishman
is a different matter.

74
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,524
You best have him take you home.

75
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,443
Redmond!

76
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,306
Barry resolved never to see Nora again.

77
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,395
But such resolutions, steadfastly
held for a whole week...

78
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,856
...are abandoned in a
few moments of despair.

79
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:40,240
No, Nora, no, except for
you and four others...

80
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,202
...I vow before all the gods my heart...

81
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,163
...has never felt the soft flame.

82
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,085
Ah, you men, you men, John...

83
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,380
...your passion's not equal to ours.

84
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,259
We are like some plant I've read of.

85
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,263
We bear but one flower and then we die.

86
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,267
You, you, you mean you...

87
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,061
...never felt an
inclination for another?

88
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,940
Never, my John. How can
you ask such a question?

89
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,442
Oh, darling Norelia!

90
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,073
Nora was chaperoned by her
brothers Mick and Ulick...

91
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,452
...whose interests would be affected...

92
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,913
...by the favorable outcome
of her affair with Quin.

93
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,887
Redmond, how nice to see you.

94
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,642
Redmond!

95
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,979
How could you do this to me?

96
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,690
Redmond, what's the matter?

97
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,150
What are you saying?

98
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,615
I think this might be the moment
to return something to you.

99
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,993
I...

100
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,412
Thank you, Redmond.

101
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,123
I must have forgotten it.

102
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,459
Yes, you did.

103
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,967
Captain Quin, may I introduce
my cousin, Redmond Barry.

104
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,512
Miss Brady, it would appear...

105
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,223
...you both have something
private to discuss.

106
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,683
It would be best for me to withdraw.

107
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,270
Captain Quin, I have nothing
private to discuss with my cousin.

108
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,316
Miss Brady, it appears you
have a great deal to discuss.

109
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,613
Captain Quin, he don't signify
any more than my parrot or lapdog.

110
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,989
Indeed!

111
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,158
Are you in the habit of giving...

112
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,079
...intimate articles of your
clothing to your parrot or lapdog?

113
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,457
Mayn't I give a bit of
ribbon to my own cousin?

114
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,918
You're welcome, miss.

115
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,379
As many yards as you like.

116
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,176
When ladies make presents to gentlemen,
it's time for other gentlemen to retire.

117
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,387
I wish you both a good day.

118
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,638
Jack Quin!

119
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,682
What's the matter?

120
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,433
I'll tell you, sir.

121
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,228
I've had enough of Miss
Brady and your Irish ways.

122
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,437
Ain't used to them.

123
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,814
What is it?

124
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,317
We'll accustom you to Irish
ways, or we'll adopt English ones.

125
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,821
It is not the English way
for ladies to have two lovers.

126
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,366
And so, I'll thank you to
pay me the sum you owe me.

127
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,619
And I resign all claims
to this young lady.

128
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,497
If she fancies schoolboys,
let her take 'em, sir.

129
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,707
You're joking!

130
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,251
Ha. I never was more earnest.

131
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,796
John, wait.

132
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,345
Meddling brat!

133
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,098
Your hand is in everybody's pie!

134
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:57,061
What business had you to quarrel
with a gentleman of substance?

135
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,202
Redmond, me boy, take a seat.

136
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,445
Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you please.

137
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,909
This sort of toast is drunk
too seldom in my family...

138
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,538
...and you'll please to
receive it with all honors.

139
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,417
Here's to Captain and Mrs.
John Quin and long life to them.

140
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,132
Go on.

141
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,469
Kiss her, Jack, for faith
you've got a treasure.

142
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,805
Come on, Jack.

143
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,184
There's the man!

144
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,403
A long and happy life together.

145
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,947
A long and happy life together.

146
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,908
Thank you.

147
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,663
Redmond!

148
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,053
Here's my toast to
you, Captain John Quin.

149
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,810
Redmond, how dare you
behave like that in my house!

150
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,604
Mrs. Brady, take the children out.

151
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,440
My dear fellow, are you all right?

152
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,120
In heaven's name, what
does all the row mean?

153
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,413
The fact is, sir...

154
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,499
...the young monkey's in love with Nora.

155
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,710
He found her and the
Captain in the garden today.

156
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,963
Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.

157
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,425
Mr. Brady, I've been insulted
grossly in this house.

158
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,804
I'm not satisfied with
these ways of going on.

159
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,890
I'm an Englishman!
And a man of property!

160
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,394
And this impudent young swine...

161
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,062
...should be horsewhipped!

162
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,940
Mr. Quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases...

163
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,193
...by calling on Redmond
Barry, Esquire of Barryville.

164
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,661
I'll see the boy home.

165
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,047
A pretty day's work, Master Redmond.

166
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,426
Knowing your uncle is
distressed for money...

167
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,889
...trying to break off a match which will
bring £1,500 a year into the family...

168
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,311
Quin has promised to pay off the
£4,000 which is bothering your uncle.

169
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,480
He takes a girl without a penny...

170
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:56,152
...a girl that's flinging herself at
the head of every man in these parts.

171
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,321
And missing them all!

172
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,618
And you, who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father...

173
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,077
I am.

174
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,706
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

175
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,626
Didn't he harbor you
when your father died?

176
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,964
Hasn't he given you and your
mother a fine house, rent free?

177
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,508
Mark this, and come what will of it...

178
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,804
...I will fight the man who
pretends the hand of Nora Brady.

179
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,059
I'll follow him if it's into
the church and fight him there.

180
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,812
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.

181
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,486
Faith, and I believe ye!

182
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,073
I never saw a lad more game in me life.

183
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,076
Give me a kiss, me boy.

184
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,164
You're after me own soul.

185
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:55,378
As long as I live, you shall
never want a friend or a second.

186
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,050
Will you take my message to
him? And arrange a meeting?

187
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,181
Well, if it must be, it must.

188
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,835
Look here, Redmond, me boy,
this is a silly business.

189
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,589
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.

190
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,509
And as sure as she
does, you'll forget her.

191
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:30,348
You're but a boy and Quin is
willing to consider you as such.

192
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,267
Right, Quin?

193
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,604
Oh, mm-hm.

194
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,734
Now, Dublin's a fine place.

195
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,822
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...

196
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,825
...here's ten guineas at your service.

197
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,038
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?

198
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,542
Yes, if Mr. Barry will
apologize and go to Dublin...

199
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,421
...I will consider the whole
affair honorably settled.

200
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,721
Say you're sorry, Redmond.

201
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,558
You can easily say that.

202
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,567
I'm not sorry.

203
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,072
And I'll not apologize.

204
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,911
And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.

205
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,423
Then there's nothing else for it.

206
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,093
God bless you.

207
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,349
This isn't my pistol.

208
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,310
It's all right, it's one of mine.

209
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,022
Yours will serve, if it's
needed, for the next round.

210
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,652
Good luck, Redmond.

211
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,499
Gentlemen...

212
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,212
...cock your pistols.

213
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,269
Gentlemen...

214
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,064
...aim your pistols.

215
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,205
One.

216
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,833
Two.

217
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,462
Three.

218
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,140
Is he dead?

219
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,729
Quite dead.

220
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,780
This has been a sad
day's work for our family.

221
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,908
Ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.

222
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,370
Now you'd better ride off
before the Police are up.

223
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,122
They'd wind of this
before we left Kilwangan.

224
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,918
Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.

225
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,777
How different Barry's
fate might have been...

226
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,780
...had he not fallen
in love with Nora...

227
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,409
...and had he not flung the
wine in Captain Quin's face.

228
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,579
But he was destined to be a wanderer.

229
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,417
And the battle with Quin set him
on his travels at an early age...

230
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,295
...as you shall soon see.

231
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,923
The boy must go into hiding
for a short time, anyway.

232
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,343
Dublin's the best place for him.

233
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,263
He can stay there 'til
matters have blown over.

234
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,891
But the child has never
been away from home before.

235
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,936
Wouldn't he be as safe here?

236
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,981
I wish that were true, Aunt Belle.

237
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,651
But the Bailiffs may
be on their way already.

238
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,156
Now, Dublin is five
days' ride away from here.

239
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,867
There's not a soul
who'll know him there.

240
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,162
I don't want to harp
on unpleasant matters...

241
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,625
...but you do know what can
happen to him if he's taken.

242
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,177
I'll be all right.

243
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,144
I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.

244
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,178
No lad with liberty
for the first time...

245
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,263
...and 20 guineas in his pocket...

246
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,057
...is very sad.

247
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,186
Barry rode towards Dublin
thinking not so much of...

248
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,648
...the kind mother left alone,
and the home behind him...

249
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,819
...but of tomorrow and all
the wonders it would bring.

250
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,625
Excuse me, miss.

251
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,627
Would it be possible to
have a drink of water?

252
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,462
Yes, sir.

253
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,302
Good day to you, young sir.

254
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,390
Good day.

255
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,065
Will you join us in a drink?

256
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,570
No, thank you.

257
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,242
Would you like something to eat?

258
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,706
That's very kind of you,
but I have to be on my way.

259
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,380
Thank you.

260
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,394
Goodbye.

261
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,529
Uh, excuse me, sir.

262
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,950
Good morning again, young sir.

263
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,331
Don't even think about it.

264
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,919
Get down off that horse.

265
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,595
Raise your hands above
your head, please.

266
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,181
Come forward.

267
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,770
Stop.

268
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,486
How do you do? I'm Captain Feeney.

269
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,116
Captain Feeney!

270
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,827
Captain Feeney, at your service.

271
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,329
The Captain Feeney?

272
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,331
None other.

273
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,543
May I introduce you to my son... Seamus?

274
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,798
How do you do?

275
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,968
To whom have I the honor of speaking?

276
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,512
My name's Redmond Barry.

277
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,389
How do you do, Mr. Barry?

278
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,686
Now we must get onto the more regrettable
stage of our brief acquaintance.

279
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,024
Turn around and keep your hands
high above your head, please.

280
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,102
There must be 20 guineas
in gold here, Father.

281
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:24,358
You seem to be a very well
set up young gentleman, sir.

282
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,321
Captain Feeney, that's all the
money my mother had in the world.

283
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,073
Mightn't I keep it?

284
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,867
I'm just one step
ahead of the Law myself.

285
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,455
I killed an English Officer in a duel, and
I'm going to Dublin until things cool down.

286
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,665
Mr. Barry...

287
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,210
...in my profession we
hear many such stories.

288
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,297
Yours is the most intriguing
and touching I've heard in weeks.

289
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,550
Nevertheless, I cannot
grant your request.

290
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,679
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

291
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:58,642
I'll allow you to keep those fine boots,
which normally I would have for myself.

292
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,312
The next town is only five miles away.

293
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,148
And I suggest you now start walking.

294
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,317
Mightn't I keep my horse?

295
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,444
I would like to oblige you...

296
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,991
...but, people like us must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

297
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,993
Good day, young sir.

298
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,843
You can put down your
hands now, Mr. Barry.

299
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:08,128
Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded
by Lieutenant General Charles Gale...

300
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,175
...which has distinguished itself
during the recent troubles...

301
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,304
...wants several men to supply
the places of those veterans...

302
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:22,100
...who have deserved to be
pensioned at one shilling a day.

303
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,188
All clever young fellows
who are free and able...

304
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:31,109
...and are ambitious of becoming
gentlemen by bearing arms...

305
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,488
...are hereby invited to
meet the Recruiting Officer...

306
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,241
...who promises that they shall
meet with every encouragement...

307
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,703
...that merit and good
behavior can entitle them to.

308
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,083
Those meeting the qualifications
will immediately receive...

309
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,669
...His Majesty's Royal Bounty
of one and a half guineas...

310
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,048
...with complete clothing,
arms and accoutrements.

311
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,843
King George and Old England forever.

312
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:09,773
Left, left, left, right, left.

313
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,067
For a young man in difficulty...

314
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:17,030
...who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...

315
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,742
...the chance to earn distinction
in the European wars...

316
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,328
...seemed a stroke of good fortune.

317
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,250
And King George needed men too
much to heed from whence they came.

318
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,855
Hey, lad! Lad!

319
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,065
Lad!

320
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,318
Can I have a new beaker?
This one is full of grease.

321
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,917
Covered in grease! Give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup.

322
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,039
If you want to vex him,
ask him about his wife...

323
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,291
...the washerwoman, who beats him.

324
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,754
Mr. Toole, is it a towel
of your wife's washing?

325
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,673
They say she wipes your
face often with one.

326
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,929
Ask him why he wouldn't see her
yesterday when she came here.

327
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,516
Mr. Toole, why did you hide when
Mrs. Toole came to visit you?

328
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,644
Afraid of getting your ears boxed?

329
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,654
Gentlemen, you may fight it
out with fists if you choose.

330
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,115
We'll form a square for that purpose.

331
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,963
Gentlemen, step this way, please.

332
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,598
Shake hands.

333
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,226
Take your stance.

334
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,981
No biting, kicking or scratching.

335
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,733
The last man to remain
standing is the winner.

336
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,362
Gentlemen, commence fighting, now!

337
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,213
Barry's training continued at the camp.

338
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,758
Within a month he was transformed
into a proper young soldier.

339
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,014
The Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...

340
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,559
...by the arrival of other troops...

341
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,354
...in preparation for joining
their armies fighting in Germany.

342
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,316
One occasion...

343
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,946
...brought the welcome appearance
of his second in the fatal duel...

344
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,240
...Captain Grogan.

345
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,220
It would have helped if we'd
known what had become of you.

346
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,433
Didn't you think of
writing to your mother?

347
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,271
Of course.

348
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,942
But the shame I felt
of losing her money...

349
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,321
...my father's sword and pistols...

350
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,908
I couldn't tell her.

351
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,204
She wouldn't care about those things.

352
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,289
You are her only concern.

353
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,043
Tonight you must write
her a proper letter.

354
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,588
Tell her that you're safe and well.

355
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,383
I will.

356
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,310
Is Miss Brady well?

357
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,401
There are only six Miss Bradys now.

358
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,990
Has something happened to Nora?

359
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,162
She took on so about your going away...

360
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,375
...that she had to console
herself with a husband.

361
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,337
She is now Mrs. John Quin.

362
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,676
Mrs. John Quin?

363
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,179
Was there another John Quin?

364
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,973
No.

365
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,268
The same, me boy. He
recovered from his wound.

366
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:50,400
The shot you hit him with could
not hurt him. It was made of tow.

367
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,403
Tow?

368
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,742
The Bradys wouldn't let you kill
1,500 a year out of the family.

369
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,249
The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

370
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,711
The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

371
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,921
...from fear of you.

372
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,799
But hit him you certainly did, me lad.

373
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,052
With a fine thick plugget of tow.

374
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,807
He was so frightened, it
took him an hour to come to.

375
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,563
Are you in want of cash?

376
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:35,153
You may draw on me. For I got a
couple of hundred from your uncle.

377
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,740
While that lasts, you shall never want.

378
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,957
It would require a great
historian to explain the causes...

379
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,294
...of the Seven Years' War in Europe...

380
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,298
...to which Barry's
regiment was now on its way.

381
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,345
Let it suffice to say, that
England and Prussia were allies...

382
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,597
...and at war against...

383
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,100
...France, Sweden, Russia and Austria.

384
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,408
Barry's first taste of battle...

385
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,787
...was only a skirmish against
a rearguard of Frenchmen...

386
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,956
...who occupied an
orchard beside a road...

387
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,794
...down which the English
main force wished to pass.

388
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,340
Though this encounter is not
recorded in any history book...

389
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,094
...it was memorable enough
for those who took part.

390
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,655
I've only a hundred
guineas left to give you...

391
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,699
...for I lost the rest at cards.

392
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,040
Kiss me, me boy, for
we'll never meet again.

393
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:53,452
It is well to dream of
glorious war in a snug armchair.

394
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,748
It is a different thing
to see it firsthand.

395
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:03,713
After his friend's death, Barry's
thoughts turned from military glory...

396
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,550
...to those of escaping the Service...

397
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,386
...to which he was tied for six years.

398
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,403
Gentlemen talk of the Age of Chivalry...

399
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,408
...but remember the ploughmen,
poachers and pickpockets they lead.

400
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:37,830
It is with these sad instruments
great warriors and kings...

401
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,417
...have been doing their
murderous work in the world.

402
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,764
Barry could not have fallen
into worse circumstances...

403
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,391
...than those in which he found himself.

404
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:02,021
But fate did not intend he should
remain long an English soldier.

405
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,440
An accident occurred...

406
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,235
...which took him out of the
Service in a rather singular manner.

407
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,893
Freddie, I hope you won't
be angry with me, but...

408
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:45,314
...I've got something to tell you
which you won't be happy about.

409
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,233
Oh? What is it?

410
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,153
First, promise me
you'll keep your temper.

411
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,367
Jonathan, don't be an ass!
You're making a big mystery of it.

412
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,619
What is going on?

413
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,872
I have to go away again.

414
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,291
For about two weeks.

415
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,753
Oh, God, you're not serious?

416
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,133
I am. There's nothing I can do about it.

417
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,802
Where to this time?

418
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:19,640
To Bremen, carrying important
dispatches to Prince Henry.

419
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,937
But you promised me last
time it would be never again.

420
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,066
I know. And I've kept my
part of the bargain, but...

421
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,195
...Pontersby insists I'm the only one
who can be entrusted with the trip.

422
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,865
Here was the opportunity
to escape from the Army...

423
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,658
...for which he had been searching.

424
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:44,040
It was only a few miles to the area
occupied by their Prussian allies...

425
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,793
...where this Officer's
uniform and papers...

426
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,463
...should allow him to
travel without suspicion...

427
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,967
...and stay ahead of the
news of his desertion.

428
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,304
Then, we'll have little time together.

429
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,890
Are you cross with me?

430
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,312
Damn you, I can't stay
cross with you for long.

431
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,899
Oh, Jonathan...

432
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,236
...at times like this I realize
how much I care for you...

433
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,823
...and how empty life
would be without you.

434
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,492
Frederick!

435
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:48,938
Barry was glad to see the
uniforms of the Prussian Infantry.

436
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,193
They showed him that he was out
of English-occupied territory.

437
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,285
His intention was to make for Holland...

438
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,872
...almost the only neutral country
of Europe, in those times...

439
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,000
...and thence to get
a passage home, somehow.

440
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,503
As he rode away...

441
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,965
...Barry felt he was
now in his proper sphere.

442
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,678
And determined never again to
fall from the rank of a gentleman.

443
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,282
Excuse me, miss.

444
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,409
Yes.

445
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,912
Good day.

446
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,499
Do you speak English?

447
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,171
I'm speaking little.

448
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,428
I have not eaten all day, no food.

449
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,016
Is there an inn nearby
where I might have a meal?

450
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,187
No... I don't think so.

451
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,610
There is nothing to
eat before Grünberg.

452
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,740
Do you live near here?

453
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,203
Yes.

454
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:35,294
Would you... feed me?
I'd be happy to pay you.

455
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,758
I think so.

456
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,743
Is it a boy or girl?

457
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,079
A boy.

458
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,583
What's his name?

459
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,834
Peter.

460
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,504
How old is he?

461
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,257
He's one year old.

462
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,720
Where is Peter's father?

463
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,016
Where he is?

464
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,144
Yes.

465
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,855
In the war.

466
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,654
How long has he been gone?

467
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,243
Sorry... I didn't understand.

468
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,370
What?

469
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,750
Oh! A long time.

470
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,087
Since springtime.

471
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,512
It must be hard for you to be alone.

472
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,684
It is.

473
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,776
It must be dangerous for you in the war.

474
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,200
I'm an Officer and must do my duty.

475
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,212
You are sometimes...

476
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,839
...lonely?

477
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,885
Sometimes.

478
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,030
What did you say your name is?

479
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,784
Lieutenant Fakenham.

480
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,370
No, I mean...

481
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,082
...what is the name before Fakenham?

482
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,251
My first name?

483
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,754
Jonathan.

484
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,007
Jonathan?

485
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,511
Would you like...

486
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,096
...to stay with me?

487
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,808
For a few days, or sometimes?

488
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,605
That would be very nice.

489
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,721
Goodbye, my beautiful Lischen.

490
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,231
Goodbye, Redmond.

491
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,820
I love you.

492
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,240
Look after yourself.

493
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,204
God be with you.

494
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:48,088
A lady who sets her heart
on a lad in uniform...

495
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,009
...must prepare to change
lovers pretty quickly...

496
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,344
...or her life will be a sad one.

497
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:00,184
This heart of Lischen's was
like many a neighboring town...

498
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:05,898
...and had been stormed and occupied
many times before Barry came to invest it.

499
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,884
During five years of war...

500
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:39,389
...the illustrious Frederick had so
exhausted the males of his kingdom...

501
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,226
...that he had to employ recruiters...

502
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,938
...who would commit any
crime, including kidnapping...

503
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:50,734
...to keep supplied those brilliant
regiments of his with cannon fodder.

504
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,685
Good evening, sir.

505
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,190
I'm Captain Potzdorf. To whom
have I the honor of speaking?

506
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:35,654
Good evening. I'm Lieutenant
Fakenham, Gale's Regiment of Foot.

507
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,531
Pleased to meet you.

508
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,159
Can we be of assistance to you?

509
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:46,415
Thank you, but I am carrying urgent
dispatches and must continue on my way.

510
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,001
And your destination?

511
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,004
Bremen.

512
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,467
Then you're obviously lost, Lieutenant.

513
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,845
Bremen is in the opposite direction.

514
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,013
Are you sure?

515
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,222
Yes.

516
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,601
Wouldn't you know it!

517
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:11,148
My departure was so hasty that my
orderly forgot to prepare proper maps.

518
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,942
I understand.

519
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,114
Please, do not be
offended, Lieutenant...

520
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,784
...but are you carrying
your identity papers?

521
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,330
Yes, of course.

522
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,333
May I see them?

523
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,712
Of course.

524
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,468
Here you are.

525
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,677
Thank you.

526
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:58,403
Thank you, Lieutenant, I hope
I haven't inconvenienced you.

527
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,530
Not at all.

528
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,702
Now that we are riding
in the same direction...

529
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:10,791
...may I offer you a meal
and a bed for the night...

530
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,710
...and a proper map for the journey?

531
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:20,759
That's kind of you, Captain.
I'd be honored to accept.

532
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,410
Barry was treated with great civility...

533
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,913
...and was asked
questions about England.

534
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:54,918
He answered as best he
could, inventing many stories.

535
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,463
He described the King and Ministers...

536
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,801
...boasted that the British
Ambassador in Berlin was his uncle...

537
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,179
...and even offered Potzdorf
a letter of introduction.

538
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,767
His host seemed satisfied
with these stories.

539
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:17,149
But, he led Barry on with a
skillful combination of questions...

540
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,734
...and flattery.

541
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,237
I know so little of your
country of England...

542
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,949
...except that you are the
bravest nation in the world...

543
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,161
...and that we are fortunate
to have such allies.

544
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,706
Lieutenant Fakenham...

545
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:37,335
...let us drink to the friendship
of our two great nations.

546
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,922
To our two great nations.

547
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,350
Ah.

548
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,988
Aren't you lucky, going
to Bremen tomorrow?

549
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,242
I know one of the loveliest
women in Europe there.

550
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,455
Would you take a letter to her?

551
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,374
Certainly.

552
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,128
By the way, to whom are you
carrying your dispatches?

553
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,841
General Williamson.

554
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,678
General Williamson?

555
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:29,888
Yes.

556
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,184
General Percival Williamson?

557
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,604
Yes, the same.

558
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,987
Sergeant.

559
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,369
This man is under arrest.

560
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,918
Under arrest? Captain Potzdorf, sir...

561
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,671
...I'm a British Officer.

562
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,882
You're a liar and an imposter.

563
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,635
You're a deserter.

564
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,974
I suspected you this morning. Your
lies and folly have confirmed this.

565
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,312
You pretend to carry dispatches to
a General, dead these ten months.

566
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,107
You say the British
Ambassador in Berlin...

567
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:25,610
...is your uncle, with the
ridiculous name of O'Grady.

568
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:31,116
Now, will you join and take
the bounty, or be given up?

569
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,163
I volunteer.

570
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,796
The Prussian Service was
worse than the English.

571
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,467
The life of a Private
Soldier was frightful.

572
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:55,974
Punishment was incessant. Every
Officer had the right to inflict it.

573
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,397
The gauntlet was a common
penalty for minor offenses.

574
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:07,944
More serious ones were
punishable by mutilation or death.

575
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,165
At the close of the Seven
Years' War the army...

576
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:26,129
...renowned for its disciplined valor,
was officered by native Prussians.

577
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,049
But it was mostly composed...

578
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,385
...of men from the lowest
levels of humanity...

579
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,514
...hired or stolen from
every nation in Europe.

580
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:42,854
Thus, Barry fell into
the worst company...

581
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:48,610
...and was soon far advanced in the
science of every kind of misconduct.

582
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,313
Help.

583
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,774
Get me out of here.

584
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:11,938
The Colonel's speech declared
the King's satisfaction...

585
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,817
...with the conduct of the
Regiment at the Battle of Audorf...

586
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:20,822
...and with Corporal Barry's bravery
in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...

587
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,910
...which was to be rewarded with
the sum of two frederick d'or.

588
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,544
Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...

589
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,754
...march!

590
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,560
Corporal Barry.

591
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,443
You're a gallant soldier,
and evidently of good stock...

592
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,446
...but you're idle and unprincipled.

593
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,157
You're a bad influence on the men.

594
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,661
And for all your bravery, I'm
sure you'll come to no good.

595
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,667
I hope the Colonel is mistaken.

596
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:20,256
I have fallen into bad company, but
I've only done as other soldiers do.

597
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:23,384
I've never had a friend
or protector before...

598
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,346
...to show that I was
worthy of better things.

599
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:30,850
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

600
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,354
But, I would go to the
Devil to serve the Regiment.

601
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,236
Corporal Barry, fall in.

602
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:56,417
The war ended and Barry's regiment
was garrisoned in the Capital.

603
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:03,841
He had, for some time, ingratiated
himself with Captain Potzdorf...

604
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,762
...whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward.

605
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,856
Good morning, Redmond.

606
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,608
Good morning, Captain.

607
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,780
I should like you to meet my
uncle, the Minister of Police.

608
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,992
Good morning, Herr Minister.

609
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,370
Redmond...

610
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:37,000
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

611
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,544
We shall get you out of the Army...

612
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:43,339
...appoint you to the Police
Bureau, and, in time...

613
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:48,136
...we'll allow you to
move in a better sphere.

614
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,347
Thank you, Captain.

615
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:59,772
Your loyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

616
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:05,111
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

617
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,031
If you succeed...

618
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,074
...depend on it...

619
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,368
...your reward will be secure.

620
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,830
I'll do my best, sir.

621
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,886
There is a gentleman in Berlin in
the service of the Empress of Austria.

622
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,848
He calls himself the
Chevalier de Balibari.

623
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,602
He appears to be a professional gambler.

624
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,271
He's a libertine:

625
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,316
Fond of women, of good food...

626
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,194
...polished, obliging.

627
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,865
He speaks French and
German indifferently.

628
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,661
But we have reason to fancy
that Monsieur de Balibari...

629
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,332
...is a native of your
country of Ireland.

630
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,253
And that he has come here as a spy.

631
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,600
Your knowledge of English...

632
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:21,396
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

633
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,024
...and find out whether
or not he is a spy.

634
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,530
Does this assignment interest you?

635
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:36,786
Minister, I'm interested in anything
that can be of service to you...

636
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,621
...and Captain Potzdorf.

637
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,760
You will not know a word of English.

638
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:59,016
If the Chevalier remarks on your
accent, say you are Hungarian.

639
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,769
You served in the war.

640
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,273
You left the Army for medical reasons...

641
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,236
...then served Monsieur de
Quellenberg for two years.

642
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:14,740
He's now with the Army in Silesia,
but you'll have a certificate from him.

643
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,642
Good morning, Your Honor.

644
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,706
So you are the young man
recommended by Seebach.

645
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,128
Yes, Your Honor, here
are my credentials.

646
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,099
Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?

647
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,437
Yes, Your Honor.

648
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:32,527
Monsieur de Quellenberg
recommends you highly.

649
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,114
Monsieur is a very good man.

650
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:47,083
It was imprudent of him...

651
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:50,836
...but when Barry saw the
Chevalier's splendor...

652
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,464
...and noble manner...

653
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:56,801
...he felt unable to
keep disguise with him.

654
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,805
Those who have never been exiled...

655
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,017
...know not what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity...

656
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,814
...and would not understand the cause...

657
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,109
...of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.

658
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,823
You seem the right one to me.

659
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:24,078
Thank you, Your Honor.

660
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,461
Are you ill?

661
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:39,343
Sir...

662
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,805
...I have a confession to make to you.

663
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,725
I'm an Irishman.

664
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,853
My name is Redmond Barry.

665
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,026
I was abducted into the Prussian Army.

666
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:58,863
Now I've been put into your service...

667
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:04,327
...by my Captain Potzdorf and his
uncle, the Minister of Police...

668
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,542
...to serve as a watch
upon your... actions...

669
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,965
...and to give information to them.

670
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,198
The Chevalier was much affected...

671
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,408
...at thus finding
one of his countrymen.

672
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,703
For he too was an exile.

673
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,790
And a friendly voice, a look...

674
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,669
...brought the old
country back to his memory.

675
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,801
He is very religious and
attends church regularly.

676
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,054
After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

677
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,769
He then takes an airing in his carriage.

678
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,314
Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.

679
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,902
The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.

680
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,281
He was instructed to tell the truth...

681
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,035
...as much as his story
would possibly bear.

682
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,999
The information he gave was
very minute and accurate...

683
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,377
...though not very important.

684
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:39,672
...But who does not acknowledge him.

685
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,608
Wine or punch, Your Honor?

686
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,402
Wine.

687
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:06,240
It was agreed that Barry should
keep his character of valet.

688
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:11,245
That, before strangers, he
should not know a word of English.

689
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:16,959
And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.

690
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,880
Having excellent eyesight...

691
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,424
...and a natural aptitude...

692
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,012
...he was able to give his
dear patron much assistance...

693
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,098
...against his opponents
at the green table.

694
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:35,853
If, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...

695
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,939
...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.

696
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,194
If he adjusted a chair
it meant Ace King.

697
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,781
If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...

698
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,158
...Hearts were meant, and so forth.

699
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,922
The Prince of Tübingen...

700
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:06,759
...who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...

701
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:12,389
...was passionately fond of
play as were the gentlemen...

702
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,558
...of almost all the Courts of Europe.

703
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,978
You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.

704
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,681
Chevalier...

705
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,603
...though I cannot say how...

706
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,440
...I believe you have cheated me.

707
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,659
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

708
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:17,246
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

709
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:20,958
I don't know.

710
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,711
But I believe I have been.

711
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,092
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

712
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,095
...which I have honorably won.

713
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:36,473
Chevalier...

714
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:42,646
...if you will have your money
now you must fight for it.

715
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,525
If you will be patient...

716
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:50,529
...maybe I will pay you
something another time.

717
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:59,079
Your Grace, if I am to be
so tame as to take this...

718
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:03,208
...then I must give up an
honorable and lucrative occupation.

719
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,421
I have said all there is to be said.

720
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,134
I am at your disposal for
whatever purposes you wish.

721
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,638
Good night.

722
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,662
Was the Prince cheated?

723
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:45,960
In as far as I am able to
tell, Herr Minister, no.

724
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,504
I believe he won the money fairly.

725
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,219
What are the Chevalier's intentions?

726
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,596
I'm not sure.

727
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:02,601
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

728
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,857
A meeting with the Prince is impossible.

729
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,406
The Prince has left him no other choice.

730
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,516
Now.

731
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,770
Will you be able to return here
tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

732
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,400
I know they won't allow
a meeting with the Prince.

733
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:56,113
But if I say that, do you know any
reason why he'll pay me what he owes?

734
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,868
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

735
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,121
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

736
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:08,667
They cannot harm me, the
Austrian Embassy will see to that.

737
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:13,630
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

738
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,926
If they should, don't worry...

739
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,846
...you shall not be left behind.

740
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,057
Have no fear of that.

741
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:29,021
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

742
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,608
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

743
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:37,529
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

744
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,074
...possibly today.

745
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,118
Then this must be done tomorrow.

746
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,537
All the arrangements are made.

747
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:54,588
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

748
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:56,965
Yes, sir.

749
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,345
Is there any reason he should
do any different tomorrow?

750
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:03,764
No, sir.

751
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,474
Good.

752
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:10,270
When the Chevalier comes out to
his carriage in the morning...

753
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,857
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

754
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,944
His baggage will be sent after him.

755
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,403
Excellent.

756
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,960
At ten o'clock the next morning...

757
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,754
...the Chevalier de Balibari...

758
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:39,133
...went out for his
regular morning drive.

759
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,435
Where's my servant, Lazlo?

760
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,355
I will let down the steps, Your Honor.

761
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,409
What is this about?

762
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,994
Please get inside.

763
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,165
Am I under arrest?

764
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,667
We're driving to the frontier.

765
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:18,422
Frontier? But I'm on my way to
the Austrian Ambassador's house.

766
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,884
My orders are to escort
you to the frontier...

767
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:24,344
...and see you safely across the border.

768
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,597
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

769
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:30,809
I have very important business at
the Austrian Ambassador's house.

770
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:35,647
My orders are to take Your Honor to
the frontier by any means necessary.

771
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,566
If you come willingly...

772
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,861
...I'm to give you this purse on
behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...

773
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,946
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

774
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,000
All Europe shall hear of this.

775
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:04,968
And so, without papers or passport...

776
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:08,889
...and under the eyes of
two Prussian Officers...

777
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:13,852
...Barry was escorted across the
frontier into Saxony and freedom.

778
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:20,150
The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.

779
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:37,125
By these wonderful circumstances,
Barry was once more free...

780
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:40,921
...and began his professional
work as a gamester...

781
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:46,885
...resolving, thenceforward and
forever, to live the life of a gentleman.

782
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,637
Ahh!

783
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,389
The four wins.

784
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:55,811
Soon he and the Chevalier were
received in all the Courts of Europe...

785
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,313
...and were speedily...

786
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,942
...in the very best society
where play was patronized...

787
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:05,654
...and professors of that
science always welcome.

788
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:10,158
The seven.

789
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,327
Why not the seven?

790
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:15,497
All... all, yes.

791
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,834
Shh.

792
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,004
CHEVALIER No more bets.

793
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:27,926
<i>Aww.</i>

794
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,136
Number seven...

795
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,554
...loses.

796
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,605
Place your bets.

797
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:47,571
Chevalier, will you give me credit
for 5,000 louis d'or, please?

798
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,198
CHEVALIER Of course, Lord Ludd.

799
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:03,503
Five thousand.

800
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,716
Now, everything on the four.

801
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:14,139
Yes, I know, everything on the four.

802
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,361
No more bets.

803
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,827
The four loses.

804
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,093
It is not important.

805
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:55,222
Now, I'm weary.

806
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,059
I would like dinner. Shall we?

807
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:03,563
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

808
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:06,400
If you don't mind.

809
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:08,735
Not at all.

810
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,201
They always played on credit with
any person of honor or noble lineage.

811
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,413
They never pressed for their winnings...

812
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,582
...or declined to
receive promissory notes.

813
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:27,462
But woe to the man who did not
pay when the note became due.

814
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,341
Barry was sure to wait
upon him with his bill.

815
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,718
There were few bad debts.

816
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:34,928
Saluez.

817
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:39,266
It was Barry's skill with the
sword, and readiness to use it...

818
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,853
...that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.

819
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,020
En garde!

820
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,448
I will pay you today, sir.

821
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,243
Thus, it will be seen, their life...

822
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:44,498
...for all its splendor, was not
without danger and difficulty...

823
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,543
...requiring talent and
determination for success.

824
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,131
And required them to live a
wandering and disconnected life.

825
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:59,179
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...

826
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,892
...and prospering with the cards, they
had little to show for their labor...

827
01:32:04,143 --> 01:32:06,770
...but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.

828
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:24,704
Five years in the Army, and
considerable experience of the world...

829
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:29,709
...had dispelled any romantic
notions regarding love...

830
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,462
...with which Barry commenced life.

831
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:37,259
And he had it in mind, as many
gentlemen had done before him...

832
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:41,054
...to marry a woman of
fortune and condition.

833
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,641
And, as such things so often happen...

834
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:49,312
...these thoughts coincided with
his setting sight upon a lady...

835
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:53,692
...who will play a considerable
part in the drama of his life.

836
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:57,112
The Countess of Lyndon...

837
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,282
...Viscountess Bullingdon of England...

838
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,867
...Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.

839
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,163
A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.

840
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,336
She was the wife of
Sir Charles Lyndon...

841
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,213
...Knight of the Bath...

842
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:19,175
...Minister to George lll at
several of the Courts of Europe.

843
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:22,637
A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...

844
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:26,641
...worn out by gout and
a myriad of diseases.

845
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,895
Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...

846
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:35,442
...acted as tutor to her son,
the little Viscount Bullingdon...

847
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:39,863
...a melancholy little boy,
much attached to his mother.

848
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,337
I'm going outside for a breath of air.

849
01:36:01,964 --> 01:36:03,256
Yes, My Lady.

850
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,708
To make a long story short...

851
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:06,588
...six hours after they met...
Her Ladyship was in love.

852
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:09,966
And once Barry got into her company...

853
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:14,053
...he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy...

854
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:18,308
...and was scarcely out
of Her Ladyship's sight.

855
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,363
Good evening, gentlemen.

856
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,989
Good evening.

857
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:17,492
Sir Charles.

858
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,996
Good evening, Mr. Barry.

859
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,916
Have you done with my Lady?

860
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:28,503
Pardon?

861
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:34,342
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool.

862
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:40,598
I think, Sir Charles, that
you've had too much to drink.

863
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:42,600
Ha, ha, what?

864
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:48,231
As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr.
Runt, introduced me to your Lady...

865
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:52,402
...to advise me on a religious
matter, of which she is an expert.

866
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:03,121
He wants... to step into my shoes.

867
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:07,250
He wants to step into my shoes.

868
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:13,256
Is it not a pleasure for me,
as I am drawing near the goal...

869
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:16,092
...to find my home such a happy one...

870
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:20,763
...my wife so fond of me, that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor?

871
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:23,516
Isn't it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife...

872
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,936
...getting everything
ready for my departure?

873
01:40:28,897 --> 01:40:32,025
I hope you're not thinking
of leaving us, Sir Charles?

874
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,697
Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.

875
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:41,576
I've been given over many
times these four years.

876
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,704
And there was always
a candidate or two...

877
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:47,707
...waiting to apply for the situation.

878
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,667
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.

879
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:52,587
It grieves me to keep you
or any gentleman waiting.

880
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,922
Had you not better
arrange with my doctor...

881
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:58,676
...or have the cook flavor
my omelet with arsenic, eh?

882
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:04,474
What are the odds, gentlemen, that
I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?

883
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,981
Sir, let those laugh that win.

884
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:15,943
Gentlemen.

885
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:39,175
I'll get a surgeon.

886
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:46,057
Have some brandy, Sir Charles.

887
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:49,060
From a report in The
Saint James' Chronicle:

888
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,731
"Died at Spa in Belgium...

889
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,693
"... Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon...

890
01:41:58,403 --> 01:42:01,322
"... Knight of the Bath,
Member of Parliament...

891
01:42:01,573 --> 01:42:02,990
"... and for many years...

892
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:07,036
"... His Majesty's Representative
at various European Courts.

893
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,875
"He has left behind him a name which
is endeared to all his friends. "

894
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,469
"Dearly beloved...

895
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:10,099
"... we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

896
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:13,603
"... and in the face
of this congregation...

897
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:18,441
"... to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony. "

898
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:21,819
A year later, on the
fifteenth of June...

899
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:24,322
...in the year 1773...

900
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:30,453
...Redmond Barry had the honor to lead
to the altar the Countess of Lyndon.

901
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:37,084
The ceremony was performed by the
Reverend Runt, Her Ladyship's Chaplain.

902
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:41,047
"And therefore is not in
any way to be enterprised...

903
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,009
"... nor taken in hand unadvisedly...

904
01:43:46,094 --> 01:43:48,387
"... lightly or wantonly...

905
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:53,809
"... to satisfy men's
carnal lusts and appetites...

906
01:43:54,102 --> 01:43:57,188
"... like brute beasts
that have no understanding.

907
01:44:00,692 --> 01:44:02,026
"But reverently...

908
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,528
"... discreetly...

909
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:06,864
"... advisedly...

910
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:09,242
"... soberly...

911
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,495
"... and in the fear of God.

912
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:18,709
"Duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.

913
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:21,754
"First...

914
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:26,509
"... it was ordained for the procreation
of children to be brought up...

915
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:30,846
"... in the fear and nurture of the
Lord, and to the praise of His holy name.

916
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:33,391
"Secondly...

917
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:39,230
"... it was ordained for a remedy
against sin, and to avoid fornication...

918
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:42,066
"... that such persons... "

919
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:45,611
Barry had now arrived at
the pitch of prosperity...

920
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:51,826
...and by his own energy had raised
himself to a higher sphere of society...

921
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:58,040
...having procured His Majesty's
gracious permission to add the name...

922
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,584
...of his lovely Lady to his own.

923
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:05,840
Thenceforth, Redmond
Barry assumed the style...

924
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,301
...and title of Barry Lyndon.

925
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,919
Redmond, would you mind
not smoking for a while?

926
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,260
Redmond?

927
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:04,982
Lady Lyndon was soon destined to
occupy a place in Barry's life...

928
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:10,112
...not very much more important than
the elegant carpets and pictures...

929
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:14,200
...which would form the pleasant
background of his existence.

930
01:46:24,127 --> 01:46:27,630
My Lord Bullingdon, you
seem particularly glum today.

931
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:35,513
You should be happy that
your mother has remarried.

932
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,143
Not in this way.

933
01:46:44,022 --> 01:46:45,648
And not in such haste.

934
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,944
And certainly not to this man.

935
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:55,866
I think you judge your
mother too harshly.

936
01:46:57,661 --> 01:47:00,496
Do you not like your new father?

937
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:03,749
Not very much.

938
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,295
He seems to me little more
than a common opportunist.

939
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:11,924
I don't think he loves my mother at all.

940
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:16,846
And it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself.

941
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:41,662
At the end of a year Her Ladyship
presented Barry with a son.

942
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,875
Bryan Patrick Lyndon, they called him.

943
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:54,842
<i>None of those ancient
heroes E'er saw a cannon ball</i>

944
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:59,555
<i>Or knew the force of powder
To slay their foes withal</i>

945
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:04,643
<i>But our brave boys do know
it And banish all their fears</i>

946
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:09,565
<i>With a tow, row, row, row,
row To the British Grenadiers</i>

947
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:14,236
Her Ladyship and Barry lived,
after a while, pretty separate.

948
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:20,910
She preferred quiet, or to say the
truth, he preferred it for her...

949
01:48:21,536 --> 01:48:25,748
...being a great friend to a modest
and tranquil behavior in woman.

950
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,420
Besides, she was a mother,
and would have great comfort...

951
01:48:31,588 --> 01:48:35,508
...in the dressing, educating and
dandling of their little Bryan.

952
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:39,428
For whose sake it was
fit, Barry believed...

953
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:43,641
...that she should give up the
pleasures and frivolities of the world...

954
01:48:43,808 --> 01:48:47,478
...leaving that part of the duty
of every family of distinction...

955
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:49,897
...to be performed by him.

956
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:11,812
Lady Lyndon tended to a
melancholy and maudlin temper...

957
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:17,026
...and, left alone by her husband,
was rarely happy or in good humor.

958
01:50:18,194 --> 01:50:21,780
Now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints...

959
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:25,534
...and find rivals even among her maids.

960
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,775
Samuel, what would the time be?

961
01:51:01,071 --> 01:51:03,572
Twenty-five minutes
past eleven, My Lady.

962
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:19,880
Shall we make this
the last game, ladies?

963
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:21,090
Yes.

964
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:10,597
Good morning, ladies.

965
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:12,474
Good morning, sir.

966
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:17,980
Would you mind excusing us? I'd
like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

967
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,007
I'm sorry.

968
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,553
This coat is made of
the finest velvet...

969
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:35,057
...all cunningly worked
with silver thread.

970
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:39,895
No finer velvet has ever been woven,
and you will see none better anywhere.

971
01:53:40,563 --> 01:53:42,105
Pardon me, gentlemen.

972
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,402
Good morning, dearest.

973
01:53:48,738 --> 01:53:52,616
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

974
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:55,077
Have a nice time. I'll see you then.

975
01:53:55,286 --> 01:53:57,079
Goodbye, little Bryan.

976
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:03,001
Lord Bullingdon.

977
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,297
Take good care of your mother.

978
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:15,639
Come now, give your
father a proper kiss.

979
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,776
Lord Bullingdon...

980
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:31,405
...is that the way to
behave to your father?

981
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:37,828
Lord Bullingdon, have
you lost your tongue?

982
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:45,919
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon. I
have not forgotten him, if others have.

983
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,964
Lord Bullingdon, you
have insulted your father!

984
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:54,011
Madam, you have insulted my father.

985
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:03,186
Dearest, would you excuse us? We
have something to discuss in private.

986
01:55:03,521 --> 01:55:04,813
Gentlemen.

987
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:18,368
One.

988
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:22,748
Two.

989
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:27,502
Three.

990
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:32,132
Four.

991
01:55:35,178 --> 01:55:36,303
Five.

992
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:40,265
Six.

993
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:50,901
Lord Bullingdon...

994
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:55,697
...I have always been willing to
live with you on friendly terms.

995
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:58,033
But be clear about one thing:

996
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:01,912
As men serve me, I serve them.

997
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:05,749
I never laid a cane on the
back of a Lord before...

998
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:09,878
...but, if you force me to, I shall
speedily become used to the practice.

999
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,883
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

1000
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,220
No.

1001
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:23,016
You may go.

1002
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:28,355
Barry believed, and not without
some reason, that it had been...

1003
01:56:28,606 --> 01:56:32,734
...a declaration of war against
him by Bullingdon from the start...

1004
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:35,988
...and that the evil
consequences that ensued...

1005
01:56:36,155 --> 01:56:38,615
...were entirely of
Bullingdon's creating.

1006
01:56:41,744 --> 01:56:44,413
I shall make you into a
real magician now, Bryan.

1007
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:47,791
I shall show you the
knot that never was.

1008
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:51,294
As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...

1009
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:55,298
...his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...

1010
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:59,302
...equaled only by his
increased devotion to his mother.

1011
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:01,638
Very good, Bryan. A little bow.

1012
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:07,102
Put it on the table for me. Thank you.

1013
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:13,734
For Bryan's eighth birthday the local
nobility, gentry and their children...

1014
01:57:14,068 --> 01:57:15,777
...came to pay their respects.

1015
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:19,072
The inside and outside are quite empty.

1016
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:22,325
Wave your hand over the
top. Is there anything there?

1017
01:57:22,493 --> 01:57:24,036
Yes? Oh!

1018
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:27,789
Wonderful! Wonderful,
colorful silk handkerchiefs!

1019
01:57:27,957 --> 01:57:30,625
Take a bow, Bryan, you
did that beautifully.

1020
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:31,960
Very good.

1021
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:34,963
Let's see if you have
something behind your ear.

1022
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:36,298
Yes, you have. Ha, ha.

1023
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:38,550
A little ball. Let's make it vanish.

1024
01:57:38,718 --> 01:57:39,760
It's gone.

1025
01:57:39,927 --> 01:57:42,387
Here it is, behind my elbow.

1026
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:47,476
Wave your hand over my
green silk handkerchief...

1027
01:57:47,643 --> 01:57:51,521
...and see if we can produce a
magic flower. I wonder if we can?

1028
01:57:52,398 --> 01:57:53,690
Here it comes.

1029
01:57:55,193 --> 01:57:56,943
The colors of the rainbow.

1030
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:01,656
You know all the colors of the
rainbow produce but one color, Bryan.

1031
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:03,909
Nothing in my magic cabinet.

1032
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:06,078
They produce the color... white.

1033
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:08,163
And there is my own...

1034
01:58:08,706 --> 01:58:11,333
...beautiful white rabbit.

1035
01:58:13,377 --> 01:58:16,338
Bryan, you did that
very well. A little bow.

1036
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:44,157
We crept up on their fort, and
I jumped over the wall first.

1037
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,159
My fellows jumped after me.

1038
01:58:46,702 --> 01:58:51,164
You should have seen the Frenchmen's
faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...

1039
01:58:51,874 --> 01:58:56,503
...sword and pistol, cut and thrust,
came tumbling into their fort.

1040
01:58:57,964 --> 01:59:01,091
In three minutes we left as
many Artillerymen's heads...

1041
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:03,051
...as there were cannonballs.

1042
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:07,764
Later we were visited by
our noble Prince Henry.

1043
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:12,185
"Who is the man who has done
this?" I stepped forward.

1044
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:15,897
"How many heads was it
that you cut off?" He says.

1045
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,817
"Nineteen," says I,
"besides wounding several. "

1046
01:59:20,027 --> 01:59:23,989
Well, I'll be blessed, if
he didn't burst into tears.

1047
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,700
"Noble, noble fellow," he said.

1048
01:59:26,909 --> 01:59:31,204
"Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut off. "

1049
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:33,582
What do you think of that?

1050
01:59:33,749 --> 01:59:36,001
Were you allowed to keep the heads?

1051
01:59:36,919 --> 01:59:39,671
No, they always become
the property of the King.

1052
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,257
Will you tell me another story?

1053
01:59:42,758 --> 01:59:44,551
I'll tell you one tomorrow.

1054
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:47,012
Will you play cards with me tomorrow?

1055
01:59:47,638 --> 01:59:49,764
Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

1056
01:59:54,145 --> 01:59:56,104
Will you keep the candles lit?

1057
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:59,649
Bryan, big boys don't
sleep with the candles lit.

1058
02:00:00,484 --> 02:00:02,277
I'm afraid of the dark.

1059
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:05,197
My darling, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

1060
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:08,783
But, I like it with the candles lit.

1061
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,870
All right, you can sleep
with the candles lit.

1062
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:14,372
Thank you, Papa.

1063
02:00:14,832 --> 02:00:15,957
Good night.

1064
02:00:38,314 --> 02:00:39,481
Ah, Redmond!

1065
02:00:40,566 --> 02:00:45,987
It's a blessing to see my darling boy has
attained a position I knew was his due.

1066
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:51,076
And for which I pinched
myself to educate him.

1067
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,080
Little Bryan is a darling boy...

1068
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:58,166
...and you live in great splendor.

1069
02:00:59,001 --> 02:01:01,127
Your lady wife knows
she has a treasure...

1070
02:01:01,295 --> 02:01:04,047
...she couldn't have had,
had she married a Duke.

1071
02:01:06,717 --> 02:01:10,011
But, if she should tire
of my wild Redmond...

1072
02:01:10,763 --> 02:01:13,098
...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...

1073
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:16,559
...or if she should die...

1074
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,897
...what future would there be
for my son, and my grandson?

1075
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,901
You have not a penny of your own...

1076
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:29,781
...and cannot transact any
business without her signature.

1077
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:36,121
Upon her death the entire estate
would go to young Bullingdon...

1078
02:01:37,915 --> 02:01:40,250
...who bears you little affection.

1079
02:01:41,836 --> 02:01:43,920
You could be penniless tomorrow...

1080
02:01:44,213 --> 02:01:48,174
...and darling Bryan at the
mercy of his stepbrother.

1081
02:01:52,596 --> 02:01:54,431
Shall I tell you something?

1082
02:01:55,808 --> 02:02:00,270
There is only one way for you and
your son to have real security.

1083
02:02:01,355 --> 02:02:03,898
You must obtain a title.

1084
02:02:05,693 --> 02:02:09,446
I shall not rest until
I see you Lord Lyndon.

1085
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,617
You have important friends.

1086
02:02:14,785 --> 02:02:17,120
They can tell you how
these things are done.

1087
02:02:18,247 --> 02:02:21,833
For money, well-timed
and properly applied...

1088
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:24,794
...can accomplish anything.

1089
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,675
And Barry was acquainted with someone...

1090
02:02:30,843 --> 02:02:32,761
...who knew how these things were done.

1091
02:02:33,804 --> 02:02:38,099
This was the distinguished Barrister
and former Government Minister...

1092
02:02:38,768 --> 02:02:40,101
...Lord Hallam...

1093
02:02:40,644 --> 02:02:45,106
...whose acquaintance he had made, like
so many others, at the gaming table.

1094
02:02:46,442 --> 02:02:50,236
Do you happen to know the
Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?

1095
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:53,281
I don't believe I do.

1096
02:02:53,449 --> 02:02:57,827
Well, this nobleman is one of the
Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...

1097
02:02:58,662 --> 02:03:03,291
...with whom our revered Monarch is
on terms of considerable intimacy.

1098
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,671
In my opinion, you would
be wise to fix upon him...

1099
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:14,260
...your chief reliance for the
advancement of your claim to the peerage.

1100
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,767
When I take up a person, Mr.
Lyndon, he, or she, is safe.

1101
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:24,020
There is no question about them anymore.

1102
02:03:24,438 --> 02:03:29,025
My friends are the best people. I
don't mean they're the most virtuous...

1103
02:03:29,985 --> 02:03:33,279
...or, indeed, the least
virtuous, or the cleverest...

1104
02:03:33,489 --> 02:03:36,324
...or the stupidest,
richest or best born.

1105
02:03:36,992 --> 02:03:38,159
But, the best.

1106
02:03:38,327 --> 02:03:41,955
In a word, people about
whom there is no question.

1107
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:46,501
I cannot promise how long it will take.

1108
02:03:47,044 --> 02:03:50,004
You can appreciate it
is not an easy matter.

1109
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:54,801
But, any gentleman with an
estate, and 30,000 a year...

1110
02:03:55,594 --> 02:03:57,303
...should have a peerage.

1111
02:04:01,809 --> 02:04:05,019
And there standing behind
me was a total stranger.

1112
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:07,814
I looked at him, and he said to me:

1113
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:13,278
"Excuse me, sir, could you tell
me, is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

1114
02:04:15,531 --> 02:04:17,949
I was so astonished, I
couldn't think of what to say.

1115
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:21,411
Then I became angry, and
said to him, "He's dead. "

1116
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:26,833
The striving after this peerage was
one of Barry's most unlucky dealings.

1117
02:04:28,335 --> 02:04:31,004
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.

1118
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:35,091
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.

1119
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:39,262
He bought lands at ten
times their value...

1120
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:43,766
...purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.

1121
02:04:45,227 --> 02:04:48,813
He gave entertainments to
those friends to his claim...

1122
02:04:49,523 --> 02:04:53,276
...who, being about the Royal
person, were likely to advance it.

1123
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:59,741
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.

1124
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:05,788
So near the person of His Majesty
that you would be astonished to know...

1125
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:10,168
...what great noblemen
condescended to receive his loans.

1126
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:15,965
This is by Ludovico Cordi...

1127
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,927
...a disciple of Alessandro Allori.

1128
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:22,514
It's dated 1605...

1129
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:25,934
...and shows, "The
Adoration of The Magi. "

1130
02:05:28,687 --> 02:05:29,896
It's beautiful.

1131
02:05:30,064 --> 02:05:31,105
Yes.

1132
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:35,527
I love the use of the
color blue by the artist.

1133
02:05:36,028 --> 02:05:37,946
Yes, that is very beautiful.

1134
02:05:40,574 --> 02:05:42,492
What is the price of this one?

1135
02:05:44,411 --> 02:05:46,663
Well, this is one of my best pictures.

1136
02:05:47,456 --> 02:05:52,252
But, if you really like it, I'm
sure we can come to some arrangement.

1137
02:05:56,966 --> 02:05:59,551
Count Andrachier.

1138
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:01,177
Mr. Henry Drummond.

1139
02:06:01,345 --> 02:06:02,428
Mr. Drummond.

1140
02:06:02,596 --> 02:06:04,180
Sir Gilbert Elliot, Your Majesty.

1141
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:05,598
Sir Gilbert.

1142
02:06:05,766 --> 02:06:07,267
Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.

1143
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:09,769
I'm glad to see you here
today, Lord Wendover.

1144
02:06:09,937 --> 02:06:11,813
What news of Lady Wendover?

1145
02:06:11,981 --> 02:06:14,983
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Lady Wendover is much better.

1146
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:19,654
Good! Present my compliments to
her. Say we miss her company here.

1147
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:21,072
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1148
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:23,199
And what of those
excellent boys of yours?

1149
02:06:23,367 --> 02:06:28,037
They're well. Charles has gone to sea
under Captain Geary on the Ramillies.

1150
02:06:28,330 --> 02:06:31,416
John has gone to Oxford to
learn how to preach and pray.

1151
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:32,667
Good, good!

1152
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:36,379
Your Majesty, may I
present Mr. Barry Lyndon.

1153
02:06:36,964 --> 02:06:40,258
Mr. Lyndon. We were very
fond of Sir Charles Lyndon.

1154
02:06:40,509 --> 02:06:42,051
And how is Lady Lyndon?

1155
02:06:42,219 --> 02:06:44,137
She's very well, Your Majesty.

1156
02:06:44,471 --> 02:06:49,350
Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops
to fight in America against the rebels.

1157
02:06:49,977 --> 02:06:53,771
Good, Mr. Lyndon. Raise another
company and go with them, too.

1158
02:06:54,648 --> 02:06:56,190
Sir Christopher Neville.

1159
02:06:56,358 --> 02:06:57,859
Sir Christopher.

1160
02:06:58,027 --> 02:06:59,110
Peregrine Cavendish.

1161
02:06:59,278 --> 02:07:00,320
Mr. Peregrine.

1162
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:10,580
Barry was born clever enough
at gaining a fortune...

1163
02:07:11,165 --> 02:07:13,207
...but incapable of keeping one.

1164
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:18,921
For the qualities and energies which
lead a man to achieve the first...

1165
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:22,592
...are often the very cause
of his ruin in the latter case.

1166
02:07:24,386 --> 02:07:28,306
Now he was burdened with the
harassing cares and responsibilities...

1167
02:07:29,058 --> 02:07:32,310
...which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.

1168
02:07:33,395 --> 02:07:34,979
And his life now...

1169
02:07:35,689 --> 02:07:40,193
...seemed to consist mostly of drafts of
letters to lawyers and money-brokers...

1170
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:42,070
...and endless correspondence...

1171
02:07:42,237 --> 02:07:44,072
...with decorators and cooks.

1172
02:08:09,139 --> 02:08:13,434
Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you for
a few minutes. Carry on with your work.

1173
02:08:13,727 --> 02:08:14,769
Yes, sir.

1174
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:33,705
Bully.

1175
02:08:34,665 --> 02:08:36,165
Mm-hm?

1176
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:38,543
What does...

1177
02:08:40,295 --> 02:08:42,046
..."strenuous" mean?

1178
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:47,802
Bryan, I'm trying to work.

1179
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:52,265
But what does it mean?

1180
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:58,896
It means "an effort
requiring strength. "

1181
02:09:05,612 --> 02:09:07,572
What does "quadrangle" mean?

1182
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:17,790
A quadrangle is a four-sided
figure like a square or a rectangle.

1183
02:09:18,792 --> 02:09:21,753
Now, please be quiet, and
let me get on with my work.

1184
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:38,811
Bryan, please be quiet!

1185
02:09:43,025 --> 02:09:44,650
Have you seen my pencil?

1186
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,322
No, I haven't.

1187
02:10:04,171 --> 02:10:06,798
Bryan, please stop making so much noise.

1188
02:10:11,386 --> 02:10:12,595
That's my pencil.

1189
02:10:12,763 --> 02:10:13,805
No, it isn't.

1190
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:15,515
It is. It's my pencil!

1191
02:10:15,682 --> 02:10:17,016
I've had this all morning.

1192
02:10:17,184 --> 02:10:18,392
It's my pencil!

1193
02:10:18,685 --> 02:10:20,394
Listen, will you be quiet!

1194
02:10:20,562 --> 02:10:21,813
It's my pencil!

1195
02:10:23,482 --> 02:10:24,649
I'll teach you a lesson.

1196
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,695
What the devil's going on in here?

1197
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:34,283
I told you never to lay
a hand on this child.

1198
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:37,912
One.

1199
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:42,375
Two.

1200
02:10:45,462 --> 02:10:46,754
Three.

1201
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:50,216
Four.

1202
02:10:52,761 --> 02:10:54,053
Five.

1203
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,015
- Aah!
- Six.

1204
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:07,233
Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?

1205
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:10,528
Yes, that will be all.

1206
02:11:14,366 --> 02:11:16,033
Well then, look you now.

1207
02:11:17,828 --> 02:11:22,498
From this moment, I will submit to
no further chastisement from you.

1208
02:11:24,668 --> 02:11:27,962
I will kill you if you
lay hands on me ever again.

1209
02:11:30,632 --> 02:11:32,550
Is that clear to you, sir?

1210
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:37,722
Get out of here!

1211
02:13:38,593 --> 02:13:41,887
Don't you think he fits my
shoes very well, Your Ladyship?

1212
02:13:47,936 --> 02:13:49,270
Dear child...

1213
02:13:50,522 --> 02:13:53,524
...what a pity it is I'm
not dead, for your sake.

1214
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:58,779
The Lyndons would then have
a worthy representative...

1215
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:01,282
...and enjoy all the benefits...

1216
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:04,577
...of the illustrious blood
of the Barrys of Barryville.

1217
02:14:09,291 --> 02:14:10,583
Would they not...

1218
02:14:11,793 --> 02:14:13,294
...Mr. Redmond Barry?

1219
02:14:19,593 --> 02:14:21,802
From the way I love this child...

1220
02:14:22,179 --> 02:14:25,056
...you ought to know how I
would've loved his elder brother...

1221
02:14:25,223 --> 02:14:27,933
...had he proved worthy
of any mother's affection.

1222
02:14:29,603 --> 02:14:30,644
Madam!

1223
02:14:33,815 --> 02:14:36,525
I have borne as long as
mortal could endure...

1224
02:14:36,693 --> 02:14:41,322
...the ill treatment of the insolent Irish
upstart whom you've taken to your bed.

1225
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:47,912
It is not only his lowly birth and the
brutality of his manners which disgust me.

1226
02:14:48,747 --> 02:14:52,124
But the shameful nature of his
conduct toward Your Ladyship...

1227
02:14:52,292 --> 02:14:55,211
...his brutal and
ungentlemanlike behavior...

1228
02:14:55,462 --> 02:14:56,962
...his open infidelity...

1229
02:14:57,422 --> 02:15:01,550
...his shameless robberies and
swindling of my property, and yours.

1230
02:15:02,636 --> 02:15:07,640
And as I cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...

1231
02:15:07,808 --> 02:15:09,558
...to witness his treatment of you...

1232
02:15:09,726 --> 02:15:12,603
...and loathe his company
as if it were the plague...

1233
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:16,899
...I have decided to leave
my home and never return.

1234
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:19,985
At least, during his detested life...

1235
02:15:20,904 --> 02:15:21,946
...or during my own.

1236
02:16:53,914 --> 02:16:54,955
Good day, My Lord.

1237
02:16:55,123 --> 02:16:56,540
Good day, Barker.

1238
02:16:59,044 --> 02:17:00,753
Will anyone be joining Your Lordship?

1239
02:17:00,921 --> 02:17:02,379
No, I shall be alone.

1240
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:09,470
Thank you.

1241
02:17:13,975 --> 02:17:15,643
The roast beef's very good, My Lord.

1242
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:17,436
Uh-huh.

1243
02:17:36,498 --> 02:17:38,582
Hello, Neville. How are you?

1244
02:17:39,042 --> 02:17:40,668
Ah, Barry. Hello.

1245
02:17:41,127 --> 02:17:43,712
I see you're alone.
Why don't you join me?

1246
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:47,007
Oh, thank you, Barry,
you're very kind, but...

1247
02:17:47,634 --> 02:17:49,885
...I'm expecting someone to join me.

1248
02:17:50,679 --> 02:17:54,598
What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I
have missed your company lately.

1249
02:17:55,016 --> 02:17:57,351
Please give my respects
to Lady Lyndon...

1250
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:00,980
...and say I've been very busy of late
and not been able to go about much.

1251
02:18:01,147 --> 02:18:02,189
I shall.

1252
02:18:02,565 --> 02:18:06,193
The eighth of next month we're
having some guests over for cards...

1253
02:18:06,361 --> 02:18:09,238
...we'd love to have you
and Lady Wendover join us.

1254
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:14,410
I'll check my diary, but I think
I'm engaged on that evening.

1255
02:18:14,953 --> 02:18:18,080
I hope you're not engaged.
We'd love to see you again.

1256
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,958
I'll write and say if I'm free or not.

1257
02:18:21,793 --> 02:18:25,254
I look forward to hearing from
you. It's nice to see you again.

1258
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:31,760
If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...

1259
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:36,598
...Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...

1260
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,476
...that now followed
him in town and country.

1261
02:18:40,937 --> 02:18:42,646
His friends fell away from him.

1262
02:18:43,315 --> 02:18:46,275
A legend arose of his
cruelty to his stepson.

1263
02:18:57,078 --> 02:18:59,955
Now all the bills came
down on him together.

1264
02:19:01,291 --> 02:19:04,918
All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...

1265
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:08,172
...and which the creditors
sent in with a hasty unanimity.

1266
02:19:08,757 --> 02:19:10,591
Their amount was frightful.

1267
02:19:12,177 --> 02:19:16,305
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...

1268
02:19:17,349 --> 02:19:21,602
...of mortgages and insurances, and
all the evils attendant upon them.

1269
02:19:23,605 --> 02:19:27,358
Lady Lyndon's income was
hampered almost irretrievably...

1270
02:19:27,817 --> 02:19:29,610
...to satisfy these claims.

1271
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:18,575
Do you think that's good?

1272
02:20:18,743 --> 02:20:19,952
Excellent.

1273
02:20:20,537 --> 02:20:21,829
Who's this?

1274
02:20:22,205 --> 02:20:23,997
It's a peacock on the wall.

1275
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,292
What's it say?

1276
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:29,670
I saw this bird yesterday.

1277
02:20:34,926 --> 02:20:36,093
Who's that?

1278
02:20:36,761 --> 02:20:38,470
Mama in her coach.

1279
02:20:39,556 --> 02:20:41,181
Is she going to London?

1280
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:43,267
I don't know.

1281
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:47,980
Parry.

1282
02:20:48,898 --> 02:20:49,940
Very good.

1283
02:20:50,108 --> 02:20:51,608
Barry had his faults...

1284
02:20:52,735 --> 02:20:56,822
...but no man could say of him that
he was not a good and tender father.

1285
02:20:58,491 --> 02:21:01,118
He loved his son with
a blind partiality.

1286
02:21:02,328 --> 02:21:03,871
He denied him nothing.

1287
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:09,209
It is impossible to convey what
high hopes he had for the boy...

1288
02:21:10,086 --> 02:21:13,380
...and how he indulged in a
thousand fond anticipations...

1289
02:21:13,923 --> 02:21:16,884
...as to his future success
and figure in the world.

1290
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:23,724
But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...

1291
02:21:24,851 --> 02:21:26,935
...that he should finish his life...

1292
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:29,271
...poor, lonely...

1293
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:31,231
...and childless.

1294
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:41,241
Papa.

1295
02:21:41,576 --> 02:21:42,659
Yes, Bryan?

1296
02:21:42,827 --> 02:21:44,620
Will you buy me a horse?

1297
02:21:44,787 --> 02:21:46,288
Buy you a horse?

1298
02:21:46,623 --> 02:21:47,748
Yes, Papa.

1299
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:50,042
But you already have little Julia.

1300
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:53,086
She's only a pony, I want a real horse.

1301
02:21:53,296 --> 02:21:55,464
Then I can ride with you on the hunt.

1302
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:57,799
You think you're big
enough for the hunt?

1303
02:21:57,967 --> 02:21:59,009
Oh, yes!

1304
02:21:59,177 --> 02:22:03,764
Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older
than I am and he rides with his papa.

1305
02:22:04,974 --> 02:22:06,808
I'll have to think about it.

1306
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:11,939
Please, say yes. There's nothing I want
in the whole world more than a horse.

1307
02:22:13,274 --> 02:22:14,608
I'll think about it.

1308
02:22:14,776 --> 02:22:16,777
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!

1309
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:23,325
How much are you asking for him?

1310
02:22:23,952 --> 02:22:25,410
One hundred guineas.

1311
02:22:26,329 --> 02:22:29,665
He's a nice little horse, but
I don't think he's worth that.

1312
02:22:30,333 --> 02:22:32,960
Seventy-five seems more
like the right price.

1313
02:22:34,796 --> 02:22:37,839
I'll accept eighty guineas,
and not a shilling less.

1314
02:22:39,801 --> 02:22:43,387
Five guineas should never keep two
gentlemen from their drink. Eighty then.

1315
02:22:43,555 --> 02:22:44,596
Done, sir.

1316
02:22:45,848 --> 02:22:49,977
Take the horse to Doolan's farm. Tell
him he needs a bit of breaking in.

1317
02:22:50,353 --> 02:22:53,981
Say it's for Master Bryan's birthday,
and I want it to be a surprise.

1318
02:22:54,148 --> 02:22:55,440
And remember that yourself.

1319
02:22:55,608 --> 02:22:56,650
Yes, sir.

1320
02:23:41,321 --> 02:23:42,362
Papa.

1321
02:23:44,198 --> 02:23:45,657
What is it, lad?

1322
02:23:45,908 --> 02:23:47,534
Did you buy the horse?

1323
02:23:50,038 --> 02:23:51,747
What horse is that?

1324
02:23:52,498 --> 02:23:55,459
The horse you were going
to buy me for my birthday.

1325
02:23:58,046 --> 02:24:00,005
I know nothing about any horse.

1326
02:24:00,757 --> 02:24:04,384
But one of the stable boys told
Nelly you'd already bought it...

1327
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:08,472
...and it was at Doolan's farm where
Mick the groom was breaking it in.

1328
02:24:09,182 --> 02:24:10,432
Is that true?

1329
02:24:11,643 --> 02:24:13,226
When is your birthday?

1330
02:24:14,896 --> 02:24:16,063
Next Tuesday.

1331
02:24:18,232 --> 02:24:20,942
Well, you'll have to wait
till then to find out.

1332
02:24:21,444 --> 02:24:24,071
Then, it's true! Oh, thank you, Papa.

1333
02:24:27,325 --> 02:24:28,533
Bryan?

1334
02:24:29,410 --> 02:24:30,452
Bryan?

1335
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,703
Yes, Mama?

1336
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:36,541
Promise me you won't ride that
horse except with your father.

1337
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:39,586
Yes, Mama, I promise.

1338
02:24:41,214 --> 02:24:43,423
And I promise you a good flogging...

1339
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:47,177
...if you even go to Doolan's farm
to see him before your birthday.

1340
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:48,762
Yes, Papa.

1341
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:49,930
You understand?

1342
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:51,264
Yes, Papa.

1343
02:24:51,724 --> 02:24:52,766
You promise me?

1344
02:24:52,934 --> 02:24:54,434
Yes, Papa, I promise.

1345
02:24:56,604 --> 02:24:58,271
All right, eat your food.

1346
02:25:07,115 --> 02:25:08,365
Come in.

1347
02:25:22,004 --> 02:25:23,296
Good morning, sir.

1348
02:25:23,464 --> 02:25:24,631
Good morning, Reverend.

1349
02:25:24,882 --> 02:25:27,134
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon...

1350
02:25:27,301 --> 02:25:29,636
...but I believe Master
Bryan has disobeyed you...

1351
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:31,972
...and stolen away to Doolan's farm.

1352
02:25:33,182 --> 02:25:36,476
On going to his room this
morning, I found his bed empty.

1353
02:25:36,728 --> 02:25:39,646
One of the cooks saw him
cross the yard at daybreak.

1354
02:25:39,814 --> 02:25:41,356
Didn't you see him go?

1355
02:25:41,524 --> 02:25:44,609
He must have passed through
my room while I was asleep.

1356
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:20,604
Oh, my God! What has happened here?

1357
02:26:20,813 --> 02:26:24,858
I noticed the lad riding
across the field, sir...

1358
02:26:25,026 --> 02:26:28,403
...and having trouble with the
horse, which was playing up.

1359
02:26:29,363 --> 02:26:33,533
Suddenly the animal plunged and
reared, and the poor lad was thrown.

1360
02:26:36,746 --> 02:26:39,039
Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?

1361
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:42,292
I'm sorry, Papa.

1362
02:26:43,085 --> 02:26:44,878
You won't whip me, will you?

1363
02:26:47,882 --> 02:26:49,299
No, my darling.

1364
02:26:50,468 --> 02:26:51,802
I won't whip you.

1365
02:26:56,098 --> 02:27:00,310
Take my horse and ride like
the Devil for Doctor Broughton.

1366
02:27:01,145 --> 02:27:04,397
Tell him whatever he's doing he
must come at once. Understand?

1367
02:27:04,774 --> 02:27:05,982
Yes, sir.

1368
02:27:14,492 --> 02:27:16,159
The doctors were called.

1369
02:27:17,203 --> 02:27:21,039
But what does a doctor avail in a
contest with the grim, invincible enemy?

1370
02:27:22,834 --> 02:27:27,212
Such as came could only confirm the
hopelessness of the poor child's case.

1371
02:27:29,382 --> 02:27:32,008
He remained with his
parents for two days.

1372
02:27:33,386 --> 02:27:37,013
And a sad comfort it was
to know he was in no pain.

1373
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:39,933
Papa.

1374
02:27:48,025 --> 02:27:49,067
Papa.

1375
02:27:50,903 --> 02:27:52,779
Am I going to die?

1376
02:27:58,744 --> 02:28:03,123
No, my darling, you're not going
to die. You're going to get better.

1377
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:11,840
But I can't feel anything,
except in my hands.

1378
02:28:14,802 --> 02:28:18,597
Does that mean I'm already
dead in part of my body?

1379
02:28:26,355 --> 02:28:29,816
No, my darling, that's where
you were hurt by the horse.

1380
02:28:32,528 --> 02:28:34,738
But you're going to be all right.

1381
02:28:39,493 --> 02:28:43,163
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?

1382
02:28:48,669 --> 02:28:50,712
Of course you will, my darling...

1383
02:28:52,381 --> 02:28:54,382
...but you're not going to die.

1384
02:28:59,305 --> 02:29:01,097
Mama, give me your hand.

1385
02:29:11,233 --> 02:29:13,026
Papa, give me your hand.

1386
02:29:19,325 --> 02:29:22,118
Will you both promise me something?

1387
02:29:25,373 --> 02:29:26,414
Yes.

1388
02:29:27,625 --> 02:29:30,877
Promise me never to quarrel so.

1389
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:33,213
But to love each other.

1390
02:29:34,048 --> 02:29:37,968
So that we may meet again, in heaven...

1391
02:29:39,053 --> 02:29:43,431
...where Bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go.

1392
02:29:51,816 --> 02:29:52,899
We promise.

1393
02:29:56,529 --> 02:29:59,614
Will you tell me the
story about the fort?

1394
02:30:02,326 --> 02:30:03,410
Of course.

1395
02:30:07,581 --> 02:30:09,249
We crept up on the fort.

1396
02:30:13,087 --> 02:30:18,591
I jumped over the wall first,
and my fellows jumped after me.

1397
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,262
And you should have seen the look...

1398
02:30:23,889 --> 02:30:29,269
...on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 he-devils, sword and pistol...

1399
02:30:30,312 --> 02:30:33,773
...cut and thrust, came
tumbling into the fort.

1400
02:30:35,276 --> 02:30:36,693
In three minutes...

1401
02:30:39,822 --> 02:30:41,031
...we left...

1402
02:30:51,417 --> 02:30:55,211
"'I am the resurrection and
the life,' saith the Lord.

1403
02:30:56,630 --> 02:31:00,133
"'He that believeth in
me, though he were dead...

1404
02:31:01,802 --> 02:31:03,428
"'... yet shall he live.

1405
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:08,016
"'And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

1406
02:31:09,435 --> 02:31:10,935
"'... shall never die. '

1407
02:31:13,731 --> 02:31:16,191
"I know that my Redeemer liveth...

1408
02:31:16,609 --> 02:31:20,070
"... and that He shall stand at
the latter day upon the earth.

1409
02:31:21,113 --> 02:31:24,908
"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

1410
02:31:25,618 --> 02:31:29,037
"... yet in my flesh shall I see God.

1411
02:31:30,831 --> 02:31:35,043
"Whom I shall see for myself
and mine eyes shall behold...

1412
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:37,420
"... and not another.

1413
02:31:39,882 --> 02:31:42,133
"We brought nothing into this world...

1414
02:31:42,718 --> 02:31:45,553
"... and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

1415
02:31:46,847 --> 02:31:51,810
"The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away.

1416
02:31:53,187 --> 02:31:55,522
"Blessed is the name of the Lord. "

1417
02:32:40,401 --> 02:32:42,694
Barry's grief was inconsolable.

1418
02:32:44,155 --> 02:32:48,032
Such solace as he could
find, came only from drink.

1419
02:32:50,995 --> 02:32:56,207
His mother was the only person who would
remain faithful to him in his misfortune.

1420
02:32:57,126 --> 02:33:00,753
And many a night, when he was
unconscious of her attention...

1421
02:33:01,172 --> 02:33:03,131
...saw him carried off to bed.

1422
02:33:08,762 --> 02:33:10,138
"O blessed Lord...

1423
02:33:10,598 --> 02:33:13,558
"... the Father of mercies
and God of all comforts.

1424
02:33:14,143 --> 02:33:17,770
"We beseech Thee, look down in
pity and compassion upon this...

1425
02:33:17,938 --> 02:33:19,647
"... Thy afflicted servant.

1426
02:33:20,858 --> 02:33:22,859
"Thou writest bitter
things against her...

1427
02:33:23,027 --> 02:33:25,445
"... and makest her to possess
her former iniquities. "

1428
02:33:25,613 --> 02:33:28,823
Her Ladyship, always
vaporish and nervous...

1429
02:33:29,658 --> 02:33:31,367
...plunged into devotion...

1430
02:33:31,535 --> 02:33:36,497
...with so much fervor that you would
have imagined her distracted at times.

1431
02:34:01,523 --> 02:34:05,485
In the doleful conditions which
now prevailed at Castle Hackton...

1432
02:34:06,278 --> 02:34:09,822
...management of the household,
and of the Lyndon estate...

1433
02:34:10,491 --> 02:34:13,660
...fell to Mrs. Barry,
whose spirit of order...

1434
02:34:13,911 --> 02:34:18,331
...attended to all the details
of a great establishment.

1435
02:34:22,503 --> 02:34:23,670
Come in.

1436
02:34:28,259 --> 02:34:30,009
You wish to see me, madam?

1437
02:34:30,511 --> 02:34:32,845
Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.

1438
02:34:37,643 --> 02:34:40,520
I have some matters I would
like to discuss later, Graham...

1439
02:34:40,688 --> 02:34:42,855
...but just now would
you go to Her Ladyship...

1440
02:34:43,023 --> 02:34:44,816
...and have her sign these papers.

1441
02:34:45,818 --> 02:34:46,943
Yes, madam.

1442
02:34:59,748 --> 02:35:01,207
Reverend Runt...

1443
02:35:02,334 --> 02:35:05,753
...I need not tell you that the
recent tragedy to this family...

1444
02:35:05,921 --> 02:35:10,216
...has made the services of a
tutor no longer required here.

1445
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,054
And as we are in considerable
difficulty about money...

1446
02:35:15,639 --> 02:35:19,267
...I'm afraid I must ask you,
with the greatest reluctance...

1447
02:35:20,185 --> 02:35:21,811
...to resign your post.

1448
02:35:27,818 --> 02:35:31,237
Madam, I'm sensible
of your predicament...

1449
02:35:32,072 --> 02:35:36,951
...and you need have no concern about
my wages, I can willingly forego them...

1450
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:42,332
...but it is out of the question for me
to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.

1451
02:35:45,919 --> 02:35:48,004
I'm sorry to say this to you...

1452
02:35:48,797 --> 02:35:54,052
...but I believe you are largely
responsible for her present state of mind.

1453
02:35:55,095 --> 02:35:58,306
The sooner you leave,
the better she will be.

1454
02:36:03,479 --> 02:36:05,772
Madam, with the greatest respect...

1455
02:36:06,357 --> 02:36:09,150
...I take my instructions
only from Her Ladyship.

1456
02:36:11,945 --> 02:36:13,321
Reverend Runt...

1457
02:36:14,031 --> 02:36:17,992
...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone.

1458
02:36:19,661 --> 02:36:23,164
My son has charged me with managing
the affairs at Castle Hackton...

1459
02:36:23,332 --> 02:36:27,627
...until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters.

1460
02:36:28,629 --> 02:36:30,797
And while I'm in charge...

1461
02:36:30,964 --> 02:36:33,424
...you'll take your
instructions from me.

1462
02:36:34,051 --> 02:36:36,219
My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.

1463
02:36:39,515 --> 02:36:40,556
Madam...

1464
02:36:42,351 --> 02:36:45,561
...your only concern is for
Her Ladyship's signature.

1465
02:36:46,522 --> 02:36:51,484
You and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune.

1466
02:36:52,361 --> 02:36:54,153
And what little remains for you...

1467
02:36:54,321 --> 02:36:57,490
...depends on keeping Her
Ladyship prisoner in her own home.

1468
02:36:57,908 --> 02:36:59,367
Reverend Runt...

1469
02:37:00,369 --> 02:37:03,371
...this matter bears
no further discussion.

1470
02:37:03,831 --> 02:37:06,457
You will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow.

1471
02:37:26,311 --> 02:37:29,105
God, help. Help!

1472
02:37:32,443 --> 02:37:35,069
In the midst of these
great perplexities...

1473
02:37:35,237 --> 02:37:38,865
...Her Ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison.

1474
02:37:40,075 --> 02:37:42,910
Though she only made
herself dangerously ill...

1475
02:37:43,787 --> 02:37:46,539
...due to the very small
amount which she swallowed...

1476
02:37:46,707 --> 02:37:50,835
...this, nevertheless, caused an
intervention from a certain quarter...

1477
02:37:51,253 --> 02:37:52,837
...which was long overdue.

1478
02:37:53,005 --> 02:37:54,213
Oh, my God!

1479
02:38:26,747 --> 02:38:28,414
If my mother had died...

1480
02:38:29,458 --> 02:38:31,751
...it would've been as
much my responsibility...

1481
02:38:31,919 --> 02:38:34,712
...as if I had poured the
strychnine for her myself.

1482
02:38:36,423 --> 02:38:39,425
For to the everlasting
disgrace of my family name...

1483
02:38:40,511 --> 02:38:43,763
...I have, by my cowardice
and my weakness...

1484
02:38:44,848 --> 02:38:47,600
...allowed the Barrys
to establish a brutal...

1485
02:38:47,935 --> 02:38:50,394
...and ignorant tyranny
over our lives...

1486
02:38:50,896 --> 02:38:53,356
...which has left my
mother a broken woman...

1487
02:38:54,441 --> 02:38:59,445
...and to squander and
ruin a fine family fortune.

1488
02:39:02,449 --> 02:39:06,786
My friends profess sympathy,
but behind my back...

1489
02:39:07,663 --> 02:39:09,288
...I know I am despised.

1490
02:39:10,791 --> 02:39:12,667
And quite justifiably so.

1491
02:39:20,092 --> 02:39:21,175
However...

1492
02:39:25,097 --> 02:39:26,973
...I know now what I must do.

1493
02:39:29,977 --> 02:39:31,435
And what I shall do.

1494
02:39:33,897 --> 02:39:35,398
Whatever be the cost.

1495
02:39:49,621 --> 02:39:51,330
Good morning, My Lord.

1496
02:39:51,748 --> 02:39:52,957
Good morning.

1497
02:39:53,959 --> 02:39:55,418
Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?

1498
02:39:55,586 --> 02:39:57,336
Yes, My Lord, he's inside.

1499
02:39:58,046 --> 02:39:59,255
Thank you.

1500
02:41:36,186 --> 02:41:37,603
Mr. Redmond Barry.

1501
02:41:41,441 --> 02:41:43,693
The last occasion on which we met...

1502
02:41:44,486 --> 02:41:47,363
...you wantonly caused
me injury and dishonor.

1503
02:41:48,949 --> 02:41:53,869
In such a manner, and to such an extent
no gentleman can willingly suffer...

1504
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:57,790
...without demanding satisfaction...

1505
02:41:58,875 --> 02:42:00,876
...however much time intervenes.

1506
02:42:05,215 --> 02:42:08,592
I have now come to
claim that satisfaction.

1507
02:42:53,513 --> 02:42:54,638
Mr. Lyndon...

1508
02:42:55,098 --> 02:42:58,017
...these are a matched pair of
pistols, and as you have seen...

1509
02:42:58,185 --> 02:43:01,520
...your second has loaded one,
and I have loaded the other.

1510
02:43:01,897 --> 02:43:06,192
As they belong to Lord Bullingdon,
you may have whichever one you wish.

1511
02:43:14,242 --> 02:43:15,701
Lord Bullingdon.

1512
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:27,421
Now, gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire...

1513
02:43:27,964 --> 02:43:29,882
...I will toss a coin in the air.

1514
02:43:30,091 --> 02:43:34,053
As the offended party, it is Lord
Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.

1515
02:43:35,222 --> 02:43:37,473
Is that agreeable to both of you?

1516
02:43:39,643 --> 02:43:40,851
Yes.

1517
02:43:43,230 --> 02:43:47,066
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire.

1518
02:43:48,443 --> 02:43:52,279
If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon
will have the first fire.

1519
02:43:54,115 --> 02:43:55,950
Is that clearly understood?

1520
02:44:03,792 --> 02:44:06,126
What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?

1521
02:44:07,671 --> 02:44:08,712
Heads.

1522
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:18,597
It is heads.

1523
02:44:20,267 --> 02:44:22,726
Lord Bullingdon will
have the first fire.

1524
02:44:27,148 --> 02:44:28,649
Lord Bullingdon...

1525
02:44:29,192 --> 02:44:31,151
...will you take your ground?

1526
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,334
One... two... three...

1527
02:44:47,502 --> 02:44:49,336
...four... five... six...

1528
02:44:49,629 --> 02:44:52,798
...seven... eight... nine... ten.

1529
02:44:59,014 --> 02:45:01,974
Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?

1530
02:45:23,204 --> 02:45:27,499
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to
receive Lord Bullingdon's fire?

1531
02:45:39,054 --> 02:45:40,137
Yes.

1532
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:45,309
Lord Bullingdon...

1533
02:45:46,686 --> 02:45:48,354
...cock your pistol...

1534
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:50,731
...and prepare to fire.

1535
02:46:05,705 --> 02:46:08,082
Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.

1536
02:46:09,042 --> 02:46:10,834
I must have another one.

1537
02:46:11,795 --> 02:46:15,172
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon, but
you must first stand your ground...

1538
02:46:15,340 --> 02:46:17,758
...and allow Mr.
Lyndon his turn to fire.

1539
02:46:21,096 --> 02:46:23,222
That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.

1540
02:46:24,057 --> 02:46:28,102
Your pistol has fired, and
that counts as your shot.

1541
02:46:42,492 --> 02:46:46,453
Mr. Lyndon, are the rules
of firing clear to you?

1542
02:46:48,415 --> 02:46:49,456
Yes.

1543
02:46:53,336 --> 02:46:54,753
Lord Bullingdon...

1544
02:46:56,256 --> 02:46:58,882
...are you ready to
receive Mr. Lyndon's fire?

1545
02:47:05,765 --> 02:47:06,807
Yes.

1546
02:47:10,061 --> 02:47:11,520
Very well, then.

1547
02:47:14,941 --> 02:47:16,275
Mr. Lyndon...

1548
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:19,194
...cock your pistol...

1549
02:47:20,155 --> 02:47:21,780
...and prepare to fire.

1550
02:48:18,838 --> 02:48:21,840
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1551
02:48:31,351 --> 02:48:33,560
Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?

1552
02:48:36,689 --> 02:48:37,731
Yes.

1553
02:48:42,946 --> 02:48:44,446
Then prepare to fire.

1554
02:48:51,121 --> 02:48:52,246
One...

1555
02:48:53,998 --> 02:48:55,124
...two...

1556
02:49:07,554 --> 02:49:11,890
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr.
Lyndon having fired into the ground...

1557
02:49:12,392 --> 02:49:15,644
...do you now consider that
you have received satisfaction?

1558
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:32,327
I have not received satisfaction.

1559
02:50:04,152 --> 02:50:06,403
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?

1560
02:50:17,790 --> 02:50:18,832
Yes.

1561
02:50:21,377 --> 02:50:22,753
Lord Bullingdon...

1562
02:50:23,713 --> 02:50:26,173
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

1563
02:50:44,776 --> 02:50:45,901
One...

1564
02:50:48,655 --> 02:50:49,821
...two...

1565
02:51:10,009 --> 02:51:14,263
Barry was carried to an inn
nearby and a surgeon was called.

1566
02:51:28,403 --> 02:51:29,861
I'm nearly finished.

1567
02:51:52,051 --> 02:51:55,053
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Mr. Lyndon.

1568
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:58,557
I'm afraid you'll
have to lose the leg...

1569
02:51:59,392 --> 02:52:01,226
...most likely below the knee.

1570
02:52:10,153 --> 02:52:11,445
Lose the leg?

1571
02:52:13,156 --> 02:52:14,323
What for?

1572
02:52:16,409 --> 02:52:18,910
The simple answer is to save your life.

1573
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:24,458
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1574
02:52:25,793 --> 02:52:28,879
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1575
02:52:29,047 --> 02:52:30,756
...and stop the hemorrhage.

1576
02:53:02,622 --> 02:53:03,663
Graham.

1577
02:53:03,873 --> 02:53:05,123
Yes, My Lord?

1578
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:10,128
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1579
02:53:11,047 --> 02:53:13,298
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1580
02:53:13,633 --> 02:53:17,552
Just tell her where he is and that
he has been wounded in the leg.

1581
02:53:18,388 --> 02:53:20,180
She will want to go to him.

1582
02:53:20,807 --> 02:53:24,893
See that she is out of the house and on
her way to London as soon as possible.

1583
02:53:25,061 --> 02:53:26,103
And in no event...

1584
02:53:26,270 --> 02:53:29,022
...is she to be allowed
to see my mother...

1585
02:53:29,273 --> 02:53:32,567
...or create any disturbance
at the house before she leaves.

1586
02:53:33,319 --> 02:53:34,528
Yes, My Lord.

1587
02:54:47,101 --> 02:54:49,060
Ah, Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

1588
02:54:50,062 --> 02:54:52,147
How nice to see you, Graham. Come in.

1589
02:54:52,315 --> 02:54:53,356
Thank you.

1590
02:54:55,026 --> 02:54:57,903
You, uh... You received my note?

1591
02:54:58,237 --> 02:54:59,738
Yes, we were expecting you.

1592
02:54:59,906 --> 02:55:02,616
Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

1593
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:05,911
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

1594
02:55:07,914 --> 02:55:10,582
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1595
02:55:11,918 --> 02:55:13,126
Won't you sit down?

1596
02:55:13,294 --> 02:55:14,836
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

1597
02:55:23,387 --> 02:55:25,013
Would you like some tea?

1598
02:55:25,181 --> 02:55:28,350
Oh, no! No, thank you,
Mrs. Barry. Not just now.

1599
02:55:34,106 --> 02:55:36,191
How's the world treating you, Graham?

1600
02:55:36,359 --> 02:55:37,943
Oh, not too bad.

1601
02:55:39,654 --> 02:55:40,946
And, uh...

1602
02:55:41,113 --> 02:55:43,073
Are you comfortable here?

1603
02:55:43,241 --> 02:55:44,533
Most comfortable.

1604
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:45,951
Good, good!

1605
02:55:49,789 --> 02:55:51,414
Um...

1606
02:55:54,126 --> 02:55:55,502
Well, uh...

1607
02:55:56,629 --> 02:55:57,796
...shall, uh, ahem...

1608
02:56:00,299 --> 02:56:02,884
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1609
02:56:04,845 --> 02:56:06,054
By all means.

1610
02:56:06,764 --> 02:56:07,889
Yes.

1611
02:56:09,725 --> 02:56:10,976
Well...

1612
02:56:12,687 --> 02:56:13,853
Mr. Lyndon...

1613
02:56:16,857 --> 02:56:19,693
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1614
02:56:20,528 --> 02:56:23,989
...to offer you an annuity...

1615
02:56:24,490 --> 02:56:28,535
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

1616
02:56:30,705 --> 02:56:33,832
Specifically on the condition of your...

1617
02:56:35,835 --> 02:56:37,419
...leaving England...

1618
02:56:38,045 --> 02:56:40,714
...and to be stopped...

1619
02:56:41,841 --> 02:56:44,050
...the instant of your return.

1620
02:56:47,138 --> 02:56:51,474
Lord Bullingdon has also
asked me to point out to you...

1621
02:56:52,893 --> 02:56:55,520
...that should you
decide to remain here...

1622
02:56:56,230 --> 02:56:59,983
...your stay would
infallibly plunge you...

1623
02:57:01,694 --> 02:57:03,570
...into jail.

1624
02:57:05,239 --> 02:57:09,909
As in view of the present
circumstances there will soon be...

1625
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:14,080
...innumerable writs taken
out against you for...

1626
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:16,666
...debts long-outstanding...

1627
02:57:17,918 --> 02:57:20,587
...and your credit is so blown that...

1628
02:57:22,089 --> 02:57:23,757
...you could not hope...

1629
02:57:24,383 --> 02:57:26,009
...to raise a shilling.

1630
02:57:56,666 --> 02:57:58,792
Utterly baffled and beaten...

1631
02:58:00,628 --> 02:58:03,588
...what was the lonely and
broken-hearted man to do?

1632
02:58:05,549 --> 02:58:09,302
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...

1633
02:58:09,970 --> 02:58:11,638
...to complete his recovery.

1634
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:15,767
Sometime later he traveled abroad.

1635
02:58:17,770 --> 02:58:21,564
His life there, we have not the
means of following accurately.

1636
02:58:22,483 --> 02:58:25,985
He appears to have resumed his
former profession of a gambler...

1637
02:58:26,153 --> 02:58:28,113
...without his former success.

1638
02:58:29,615 --> 02:58:31,658
He never saw Lady Lyndon again.
