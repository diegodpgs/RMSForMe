1
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,311
This is what I get in return
for 30 years of service for my company?

2
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,273
And they send some yo-yo like you
in here

3
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,817
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

4
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,986
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.

5
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,198
You have a lot of gall coming in here
and firing your number one producer.

6
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,408
And then you're going
to go home tomorrow

7
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,410
and make more money
than you've ever made in your life,

8
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,662
and I'm going to go home
without a pay check. Fuck you.

9
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,998
I just...
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.

10
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,041
I don't know where this is coming from.

11
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,710
How am I supposed to go back as a man

12
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,004
and explain this to my wife
that I lost my job?

13
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,131
On a stress level,

14
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,135
I've heard that losing your job
is like a death in the family.

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,055
But personally, I feel more like

16
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,811
the people I worked with were my family
and I died.

17
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:53,399
I can't afford to be unemployed.
I have a house payment. I have children.

18
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,402
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,

19
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,822
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.

20
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,991
Who the fuck are you, man?

21
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,745
Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?

22
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,539
Poor Steve has worked here
for seven years.

23
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,002
He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall

24
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,087
or told me a story in the break room.

25
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,714
And that's because I don't work here.

26
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,176
I work for another company that lends
me out to pussies like Steve's boss

27
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,637
who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,

28
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,513
and in some cases, for good reason.

29
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,892
Because people do crazy shit
when they get fired.

30
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,440
Did I do something wrong?

31
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,692
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?

32
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,111
This is not an assessment
of your productivity.

33
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,781
You gotta try not to take this personally.

34
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,950
"Don't take it personally."

35
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,953
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

36
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,790
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna
find a lot of good answers in here.

37
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful,
a packet.

38
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,753
Thank you. A packet.

39
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,426
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

40
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,804
sat where you are right now.

41
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,224
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.

42
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,059
That's the truth.

43
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,567
I'm gonna need your keycard.

44
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,196
Great. Okay.

45
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,574
Now, I want you to take the day,
go get together your personal things,

46
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,995
and then tomorrow,
you get yourself some exercise.

47
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,496
You go out for a jog,

48
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,750
you give yourself some routines,
and pretty soon you find your legs.

49
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
How do I get in touch with you?

50
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,838
Don't worry,
we'll be in touch with you soon.

51
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,090
This is just the beginning.

52
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,343
I'll never see Steve again.

53
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,654
Thank you.

54
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,865
To know me is to fly with me.

55
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,950
This is where I live.

56
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,081
When I run my card, the system
automatically prompts the desk clerk

57
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,250
to greet me with this exact statement.

58
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,878
Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

59
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,296
It's these kinds of systemized,

60
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,382
friendly touches
that keep my world in orbit.

61
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,961
All the things you probably
hate about traveling,

62
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,091
the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,

63
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,803
the cheap sushi,
are warm reminders that I'm home.

64
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,527
Do you want the cancer?

65
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,323
- The what?
- Do you want the cancer?

66
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,991
The cancer?

67
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,285
The can, sir?

68
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,205
No. I'm fine, thank you.

69
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,855
How much does your life weigh?

70
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,609
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

71
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,362
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

72
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,364
Feel them?

73
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,493
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

74
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,164
You start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers,

75
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,875
the knickknacks, the collectibles.

76
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,502
Feel the weight as that adds up.

77
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,379
Then you start adding larger stuff,

78
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,592
clothes, tabletop appliances,
lamps, linens,

79
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,677
your TV.

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,846
The backpack should be
getting pretty heavy now.

81
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,556
And you go bigger.

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,685
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.

83
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,854
Your car, get it in there.

84
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,692
Your home, whether it's a studio
apartment or a two-bedroom house,

85
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,862
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.

86
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,574
Now try to walk.

87
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,453
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

88
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,164
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis.

89
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,042
We weigh ourselves down
until we can't even move.

90
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,462
And make no mistake, moving is living.

91
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,840
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack
on fire.

92
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,801
What do you want to take out of it?
Photos?

93
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,054
Photos are for people
who can't remember.

94
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,848
Drink some ginkgo
and let the photos burn.

95
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:23,812
In fact, let everything burn and imagine
waking up tomorrow with nothing.

96
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,400
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

97
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,368
Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

98
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,254
Ryan Bingham's office.

99
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,589
You put me in a Dodge Stratus
in Kansas City.

100
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,633
They were completely out of
all full-size sedans.

101
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,801
- Did you try...
- Yes.

102
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,594
I reminded them of your remarkable

103
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,721
No.1 Gold Club status
and years in the program.

104
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,016
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.

105
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,269
Fair enough. Any other messages?

106
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,478
Your sister Kara called.

107
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,939
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.

108
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,317
I told her you were mid-air and
not even I knew your final destination.

109
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,152
- Well done.
- And you got an invitation

110
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,238
to speak at Goalquest in Vegas.

111
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,032
Goalquest 20?

112
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,703
Every once in a while, I do speaking
engagements, motivational kind of stuff.

113
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,415
But Goalquest?
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.

114
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,542
It's got a hologram on it.

115
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,253
They're calling it Dos Equis.

116
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,421
All right, I'll check in.

117
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,173
- Hold on. I've got Craig Gregory for you.
- Wait...

118
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,383
Fuck.

119
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,261
How is my little road warrior?

120
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,472
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.

121
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,725
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Ry guy.

122
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,643
Hey, you know that Big Auto
is about to cut

123
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,353
another 10K before the end
of the month?

124
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,147
- No kidding.
- Yeah. Christmas came early.

125
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,940
I wish I could have you
in about five places at once,

126
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,859
but I do need you back here in Omaha
by the end of week.

127
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,694
- All right?
- I thought you needed me everywhere.

128
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,989
Well, you know, we got something
real big here, a real game changer.

129
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,324
What are we talking about here?

130
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:04,121
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in two weeks, hallelujah.

131
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,749
- That's me hanging up on you.
- Great, love that sound.

132
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,104
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

133
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,942
Yeah, I am.

134
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,987
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.

135
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,239
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

136
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,159
If a car has over 20,000 miles,
I won't drive it.

137
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,413
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like to park and go.

138
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,290
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.

139
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,542
It's funny. You don't seem like a girl
who needs directions.

140
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,630
I hate asking for directions.
That's why I get a nav.

141
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,593
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

142
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,347
- Is that a joke?
- Yes.

143
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,892
- Because their kiosk placement blows.
- They never have available upgrades.

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,727
Basically, it's a fleet of shit-boxes.

145
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,230
I don't know
how they're still in business.

146
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,399
- I'm Ryan.
- I'm Alex.

147
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,655
Maplewood card.

148
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,241
How dare you bring that
into this palace?

149
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,951
Hilton offers equal value and better food,

150
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,245
but the Maplewood gives out
warm cookies at check-in.

151
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,538
They got you with the cookies, did they?

152
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,706
Yeah. I'm a sucker for
simulated hospitality.

153
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,417
You know,
there's an industry term for that.

154
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,003
It's a mixture of "faux" and "homey."
"Faumey."

155
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,673
Oh, my God.

156
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,259
I wasn't sure this actually existed.

157
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,261
This is the American Airlines...

158
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,596
It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

159
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,437
- What is that, carbon fiber?
- Graphite.

160
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,938
Oh, God, I love the weight.

161
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,107
I was pretty excited the day
that bad boy came in.

162
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,942
Yeah. I'll say.

163
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,236
I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.

164
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,530
Sixty thou a year, domestic.

165
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,450
- That's not bad.
- Don't patronize me.

166
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,285
- What's your total?
- It's a personal question.

167
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,953
- Oh, please.
- And we hardly know each other.

168
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,540
Come on. Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.

169
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,711
- I bet it's huge.
- You have no idea.

170
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,546
How big?

171
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,673
What is it, this big?

172
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,134
- This big?
- I don't want to brag.

173
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,178
Come on! Come on.

174
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,515
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.

175
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,395
This is pretty fucking sexy.

176
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,023
Hope it doesn't cheapen
our relationship.

177
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,734
We're two people who get turned on
by elite status.

178
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,111
I think cheap is our starting point.

179
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,405
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

180
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,871
So, we came up with this master plan,
which was for me

181
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,126
to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.

182
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,545
Then we got on the plane,

183
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,007
transatlantic, flying to Zürich.

184
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,301
Walked up... Waited till it was dark,

185
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,887
and walked up to the bathroom with her.

186
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,640
Everybody was watching the movie,
and I was like...

187
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,433
Opened up, went inside.

188
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,060
She opened the door for me,

189
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,978
and came in
like she was gonna help me.

190
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,356
And then, you know, we gave it
our best shot. It wasn't great.

191
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,233
But it was fun. It was tricky.

192
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,527
- Give me some details.
- Well, it's not so easy.

193
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,404
- Have you ever tried it? It's not so easy.
- Yes, I have.

194
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,075
- Really?
- Really.

195
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,874
- You've done that?
- I have done that.

196
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,085
On a transatlantic flight?

197
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,088
On a domestic flight. Regional, actually.

198
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,965
- Like nighttime?
- No, like daytime.

199
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,925
- You...
- What?

200
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,426
I mean, how do you do that?

201
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,512
I'm really flexible.

202
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,976
Look.

203
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,359
I should throw these out.

204
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,574
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.

205
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,033
Here, look.

206
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,677
Good call on that towel rack.

207
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,138
I like how you burritoed me
in the sofa cushions.

208
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,973
I was improvising.

209
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,101
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

210
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,187
- We got to do this again.
- Yeah.

211
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,363
All right, I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th,

212
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,033
Oklahoma City on the 15th.

213
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,453
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by
Albuquerque week of the 16th.

214
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,330
No, but I'll be in Florida on the 20th.

215
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,457
- Fort Lauderdale?
- Miami.

216
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,542
- That's nothing.
- Forty minutes.

217
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,473
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.

218
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,017
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.

219
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,735
Nice meeting you.

220
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,570
A pleasure.

221
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,149
- Hello?
- Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?

222
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,945
Every family has the one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.

223
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,197
That's my sister Kara, the glue.

224
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,783
Fine. You and the kids?

225
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,954
Missy's outstanding,
Matthew made varsity. How's the road?

226
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,665
- Couldn't be better.
- Good. So, Ryan?

227
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,709
Yeah?

228
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,210
I didn't even want to have to ask you this

229
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,463
because I know how you are
about doing things for others,

230
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,174
but we're coming up on three weeks
to go to Julie's wedding

231
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,218
and there's something
we could really use your help on.

232
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,344
Yeah?

233
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,096
We've been sending people these kits

234
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,765
so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardboard

235
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,351
and then take photos of them
in interesting places,

236
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,145
kind of like that gnome
in the French movie.

237
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,271
Why?

238
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,399
Because it's Julie's wedding
and she thinks it would be fun.

239
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,985
- Does it matter why?
- How is Julie?

240
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,987
Would you call her?
She thinks you've turned to butter.

241
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,239
You're awfully isolated the way you live.

242
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,116
Isolated? I'm surrounded.

243
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,702
So, your assistant said
you were gonna be in Vegas.

244
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,786
Did he?

245
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,749
Can you get a photo of the cutout
in front of the Luxor pyramid?

246
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,834
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.

247
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,712
Jesus, Ryan,
I'm not asking you to check in.

248
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,922
Can you just take a stupid photo?

249
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,258
I'll try my best.

250
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,011
Thank you for trying your best.

251
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,200
Last year, I spent 322 days on the road,

252
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,745
which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.

253
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,813
Hey, neighbor.

254
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,481
Hey. Hi!

255
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,734
Hi. Hey, I signed for this
while you were gone.

256
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,402
Thanks.

257
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,906
- I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
- Nah.

258
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,912
Wow.

259
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,083
Yeah, it's my sister. I haven't met
the guy yet. They're getting married.

260
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,585
- Lots of luck.
- I know, right?

261
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,130
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna come over later?

262
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,760
I've started seeing somebody.

263
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,429
Okay. Great.

264
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,975
Hey, it's good to see you.

265
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,229
- You, too.
- It seems like it's been a while this time.

266
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,870
Okay.

267
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,541
I am just... I'm thrilled that
everyone's back under one roof.

268
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,792
Welcome home, boys.

269
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,169
I know there's been a lot of whispering
about why we're here,

270
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:17,591
so let me jump right in.
Retailers are down 20%.

271
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,093
Auto industry is in the dump.

272
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,512
Housing market
doesn't have a heartbeat.

273
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,891
It is one of the worst times on record
for America.

274
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,477
This is our moment.

275
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,065
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here

276
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,901
from Cornell,

277
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,404
and she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.

278
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,032
And my first reaction was,
"Who does this kid think that she is?"

279
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,409
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out.

280
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,330
So, with a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.

281
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,753
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.

282
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,049
"Glocal"?

283
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,885
Glocal.

284
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,180
Our global must become local.

285
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:11,227
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.

286
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,522
It's expensive, and it's inefficient.

287
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,776
When I came to Craig
three months ago with this,

288
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,447
he told me, and quite astutely,
it's only a problem if you have a solution.

289
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,617
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.

290
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,914
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

291
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,460
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.

292
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,337
We'll see about that.

293
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,258
Now Ned could be any employee in any
one of our clients' locations worldwide.

294
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,469
Strategy packets
will be shipped in advance.

295
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,553
Ned would be given a seat

296
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,556
and find one of our transition specialists
waiting for him.

297
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,560
Mr. Laskin, the reason
we're having this conversation

298
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,729
is your position is no longer available.

299
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,065
I don't understand. I'm fired?

300
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,484
Hearing the words "you've been let go"
is never easy.

301
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,987
Change is always scary,
but consider the following.

302
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,322
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

303
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,490
sat where you are now.

304
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,576
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

305
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,328
That's my fucking line.

306
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,288
But what happens now?

307
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,832
This is the first step of a process

308
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,042
that will end with you in a new job
that fulfills you.

309
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,961
Yeah. But how does it work?

310
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,879
I want you to take the packet
in front of you.

311
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,174
Review it. All the answers
you're looking for are inside.

312
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,884
Start filling out
the necessary information,

313
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,679
and before you know it, you'll be
on your way to new opportunities.

314
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,015
Now, Ned,
I need you to go back to your desk

315
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,766
and start putting together your things.

316
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,562
As a favor to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.

317
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,355
Panic doesn't help anyone.

318
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,524
I understand.

319
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,444
Give it up for Ned.

320
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,201
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,

321
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,120
and finish the day in San Francisco,

322
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,289
all for the price of a T1 line.

323
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,126
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.

324
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,546
And more importantly
to you guys on the road,

325
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,923
no more Christmases
in a hotel in Tulsa,

326
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,301
no more hours lost to weather delays.

327
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,386
You get to come home.

328
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,308
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

329
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,144
That's why I brought
the entire company in from the road,

330
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,729
because we're not taking it seriously.

331
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,857
There is a methodology to what I do.
There is a reason why it works.

332
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,901
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years, all right.

333
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,569
Are you familiar with them?

334
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,737
Now just like anything else, you know,

335
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,405
it's gonna take a few months
of sort of transition

336
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,574
and then everybody is gonna settle in.

337
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,867
Who are you taking off the road?

338
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,203
How are you not getting this?
You're grounded.

339
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,580
Everybody's grounded. It's done.

340
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,167
What we do here is brutal,
and it does leave people devastated.

341
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,920
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

342
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,256
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, is that right?

343
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,133
- You wanted to see me?
- Well...

344
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,843
Yeah. You know what?
Yeah, come on in.

345
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,678
- Come on in here.
- Great job out there, Natalie.

346
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,057
- Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
- Great.

347
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,936
Listen, I admire your... Your zeal.

348
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,604
And I think
you have some very good ideas.

349
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,441
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.

350
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,986
You can set up an iChat,
but you don't know how people think.

351
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,531
- Actually, I minored in psychology.
- Nice.

352
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,452
- Okay, kiddo, fire me.
- Ryan.

353
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,287
Well, since she's gonna be doing this
on a regular basis,

354
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,831
don't you wanna know if
she can fire somebody?

355
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,583
- She's fired Ned.
- My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

356
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,212
- You don't need to do this.
- No, it's okay. I got this.

357
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,799
Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you

358
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,344
that your position at this company
is no longer available.

359
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,346
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Miss Keener.

360
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,765
- I'm here today to discuss your future.
- My future?

361
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,433
The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

362
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,102
Mr. Gregory hired me
to handle this for him.

363
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,812
Handle what? Handle me?

364
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,481
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.

365
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,608
You know what?
I'm gonna go talk to him.

366
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,027
- Mr. Bingham.
- No, no, no. You can't follow me.

367
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,487
You're on a computer screen,
remember?

368
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,156
- Ryan.
- All right. Let's try this again.

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,615
- Fire me again.
- I just did.

370
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,325
Actually, you didn't. Fire me.

371
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,827
That's enough. I think we get it.

372
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,579
Mr. Bingham,
I'm here today to inform you

373
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,165
that your position is no longer available.

374
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,834
- I'm fired?
- Yes, you're fired.

375
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,170
- Never say fired.
- You've been let go.

376
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,297
- Why?
- This is a mythical situation.

377
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,923
How could I possibly know why?

378
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,259
Why doesn't matter.
You never know why.

379
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,760
It's important not to focus on the why

380
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,138
and rather to spend your energy
thinking about your future.

381
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,266
Well, I'm gonna spend my energy
on suing you unless you give me

382
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,767
- a good reason why you're firing me.
- Mr. Bingham,

383
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,977
the reason's not important.

384
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,897
So, you're firing me without grounds?
Now I really have a lawsuit.

385
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,398
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.

386
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,526
- Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
- Personally?

387
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,404
This is the most personal situation
that you are ever gonna enter,

388
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,657
so before you try to revolutionize
my business,

389
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:38,119
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.

390
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,673
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

391
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,635
Am I the only one that sees
that by doing this

392
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,553
we're making ourselves irrelevant?

393
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,056
No, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.

394
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,515
- Nice.
- Don't blame me.

395
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,061
Blame the high fuel costs. Blame
insurance premiums. Blame technology.

396
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,437
You know, you better watch yourself.

397
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,356
You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.

398
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,815
I'm not a dinosaur.

399
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
I want you to show her the ropes.

400
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:13,112
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.

401
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,156
I'm not talking about here.

402
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:19,953
- No.
- Yeah.

403
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,412
Come on.
You're very, very confident this girl

404
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,081
- doesn't know what she's doing, so...
- Well, I'm sorry.

405
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,626
I don't think a MySpace page qualifies
you to rewire an entire company.

406
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,127
Well, then great. Here's your chance.

407
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,338
Go out there, show her the magic,
take her through the paces.

408
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,382
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

409
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,636
Now here we go.

410
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,846
Bingham, here's the boat.

411
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,350
And here's you.
Do you want to be in the boat?

412
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,893
Yeah, alone.

413
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,898
We're ringing the bell.
We're rounding everybody up.

414
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,233
You want to stay out there
a little bit longer,

415
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,361
you're welcome to do it,
but you will not be alone, okay?

416
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,154
You let me know.

417
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,380
Oh, Christ.

418
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,350
- What?
- Follow me.

419
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,022
I really like my luggage.

420
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
That's exactly what it is, it's luggage.

421
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,026
You know how much time you lose
by checking in?

422
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,238
- I don't know. Five, 10 minutes?
- Thirty-five minutes a flight.

423
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,866
I travel 270 days a year.

424
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,161
That's 157 hours.
That makes seven days.

425
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,872
You're willing to throw away
an entire week on that?

426
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,175
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.

427
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,137
You're not gonna need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.

428
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,681
This, they have better ones there.

429
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,642
I'll get rid of this.

430
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,853
I can just meet you at security.

431
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,648
Thank you.

432
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,611
Bingo, Asians.

433
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,072
You can't be serious.

434
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,199
Never get behind people
traveling with infants.

435
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,993
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.

436
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,203
Old people are worse.

437
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,871
Their bodies are littered
with hidden metal,

438
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,125
and they never seem to appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.

439
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,209
Here you go.

440
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,213
Five words. Randomly selected
for additional screening.

441
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,506
Asians.

442
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:22,093
They pack light, travel efficiently,
and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.

443
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,387
- You've got to love them.
- That's racist.

444
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm like my mother. I stereotype.
It's faster.

445
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,879
Are you mad at your computer?

446
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,882
I type with purpose.

447
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,178
What is it that you're working on
so furiously?

448
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,347
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.

449
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:12,018
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.

450
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,146
It's a script taking you through
the steps of firing someone.

451
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,814
Who's it for?

452
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,692
Well, theoretically,
you could put it in the hands of anyone

453
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,903
and they'd be downsizing immediately.

454
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,739
All you have to do is follow the steps.

455
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,450
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?

456
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,785
We prepare the newly unemployed

457
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,662
for the emotional and physical hurdles
of job hunting,

458
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,581
while minimizing legal blowback.

459
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,875
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.

460
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,585
Okay. What are we doing?

461
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,463
We are here to make limbo tolerable,

462
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,675
to ferry wounded souls
across the river of dread

463
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,095
until the point where hope
is dimly visible.

464
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,852
And then stop the boat, shove them
in the water and make them swim.

465
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:58,940
That was really impressive.
Are you gonna put that in your book?

466
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,036
I got to grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.

467
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,371
Okay.

468
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,540
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

469
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,876
I'm in Hotlanta,
and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.

470
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,003
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

471
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,713
You never called.

472
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,132
Well, I wasn't sure
what was appropriate.

473
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,259
Appropriate?

474
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,303
Ryan, I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.

475
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,139
That word has no place
in our vocabulary.

476
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,184
I am the woman that you don't have
to worry about.

477
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,521
Sounds like a trap.

478
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,525
Listen, the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.

479
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,735
If you wanna call, call.

480
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,197
Just think of me as yourself,
only with a vagina.

481
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,783
When am I gonna see you?

482
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,662
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,

483
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,582
with a connection at ORD into SDF.

484
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,002
- Sorry.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

485
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,754
How long's your layover?
They got multiples into SDF.

486
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,256
Think you could push?

487
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,593
Yeah, I can push.

488
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,775
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

489
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,946
And when I talk about a strategy packet,
hand them one of those.

490
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,781
Sounds great.

491
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:34,035
So, although I wish I were here
with better news,

492
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,871
the fact is that
you and I are sitting here today

493
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,542
because this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

494
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,794
- Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?

495
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,922
Am I supposed to feel better
that I'm not the only one losing my job?

496
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,758
This is ridiculous!

497
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,636
I have been a fine employee
for over 10 years,

498
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,471
and this is the way you treat me.

499
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,891
How do you sleep at night, man? How?

500
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,269
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?

501
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,396
Electricity still on?

502
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,316
Heat still on? Refrigerator full of food?

503
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,069
Gas tank full of gas?

504
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,946
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?

505
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,239
Not me.

506
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,202
No, my kids,
we're not gonna do anything.

507
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,917
What do you suggest I tell them?

508
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,840
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect

509
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,260
that your career transition
can have on your children.

510
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,221
The positive effect?

511
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,808
I make about 90 grand a year now.

512
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,645
Unemployment is what,
250 bucks a week?

513
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,231
Is that one of your positive effects?

514
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,440
Well, we'll get to be cozier,

515
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,859
because I'm not gonna be able
to pay my mortgage on my house.

516
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,403
So, maybe we can move
into a nice fucking

517
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,863
one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

518
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,950
And I guess without benefits,

519
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,663
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma

520
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,958
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.

521
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,545
Well, tests have shown that children
under moderate trauma

522
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,965
have a tendency
to apply themselves academically

523
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,926
as a method of coping.

524
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,138
Go fuck yourself.

525
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,474
That's what my kids'll think.

526
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,477
Your children's admiration
is important to you?

527
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,480
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

528
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,567
Well, I doubt they ever
admired you, Bob.

529
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,821
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

530
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,907
I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake-up call.

531
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,659
You know why kids love athletes?

532
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,745
I don't know.
Because they screw lingerie models?

533
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,413
No, that's why we love athletes.

534
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,333
Kids love athletes
because they follow their dreams.

535
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,423
- Well, I can't dunk.
- No, but you can cook.

536
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,592
What are you talking about?

537
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,679
Your résumé says that you minored
in French culinary arts.

538
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,932
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,

539
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,269
but you bussed tables at Il Picador
to support yourself.

540
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,939
And then you get out of college
and you come and you work here.

541
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,067
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

542
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,487
27 grand a year.

543
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,530
And when were you going to stop

544
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,617
and come back
and do what makes you happy?

545
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,745
Good question.

546
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,499
I see guys who work at
the same company for their entire lives,

547
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,501
guys exactly like you.

548
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,628
They clock in, they clock out,

549
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,631
and they never have
a moment of happiness.

550
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,927
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

551
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,262
This is a rebirth.

552
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,391
Now, if not for you,
do it for your children.

553
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,090
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

554
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,844
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honors members.

555
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,264
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.

556
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,812
Hungry much?

557
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,108
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.

558
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,861
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.

559
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,154
Okay, you got to fill me in
on the miles thing.

560
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,573
What is that about?

561
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,909
Are you talking about, like,
frequent flyer miles?

562
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,246
- You really want to know?
- I'm dying to know.

563
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,582
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it

564
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,751
unless it somehow profits
my mileage account.

565
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,546
So, what are you saving up for,
Hawaii, South of France?

566
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,632
It's not like that. The miles are the goal.

567
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,968
That's it?

568
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,053
You're saving just to save?

569
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,890
Let's just say that I have a number
in mind and I haven't hit it yet.

570
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,225
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

571
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,686
I'd rather not.

572
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,480
Is it a secret target?

573
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,817
It's 10 million miles.

574
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,904
Okay. Isn't 10 million just a number?

575
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,157
- Pi's just a number.
- Well, we all need a hobby.

576
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,744
No, I...
I don't mean to belittle your collection.

577
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,746
I get it. It sounds cool.

578
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,583
I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.

579
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:36,587
- Do they throw you a parade?
- You get lifetime executive status.

580
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,047
You get to meet the chief pilot,

581
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,214
- Maynard Finch.
- Wow.

582
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,925
And they put your name
on the side of a plane.

583
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,885
Men get such hard-ons
from putting their name on stuff.

584
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,137
You guys don't grow up.
It's like you need to pee on everything.

585
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,680
Now who's stereotyping?

586
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,601
Fear of mortality. It's like,
"Yeah, you're gonna die one day."

587
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,479
And why do you suppose
that's singular to men?

588
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,105
Probably because you can't have babies.

589
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,690
The baby argument.

590
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,489
If I had that many miles,

591
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,407
I would show up at an airport,

592
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,869
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.

593
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,865
Thanks for the advice.

594
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,094
Oh, Jesus.

595
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,284
Okay. Closer.

596
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,870
Way closer.

597
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,749
Still closer.

598
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,625
Closer. Okay.

599
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,795
A little left.

600
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,964
Okay, down a little.

601
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,717
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.

602
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,555
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?

603
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,224
My sister is kooky.
She thinks this is charming.

604
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,476
It's like the gnome thing.

605
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,269
No, I mean,
why would your sister want a fake photo

606
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,146
in front of the St. Louis airport?

607
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,106
Are you kidding, Lambert Field?

608
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,858
The Wright brothers flew through there.

609
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,070
That domed main terminal,
it's the first of its kind.

610
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,239
It's a precursor from everything,
from JFK to de Gaulle.

611
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,992
- Pretty sweet.
- Just take the picture.

612
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,164
Well, that's a keeper.

613
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,124
Let me see it.

614
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,919
Why she wants dozens of reminders

615
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,630
of all the places she hasn't been
is beyond me.

616
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,007
Well, I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.

617
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,009
Look, before Lindbergh could cross
the Atlantic,

618
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,011
he took off from one of those runways.

619
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,430
Do you ever wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St. Louis?

620
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,307
- No.
- Well...

621
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,443
Do you know how fucked
this place is now?

622
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,570
I am the one thing, the one thing,

623
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:52,491
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.

624
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,208
Sometimes they just need to vent.

625
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,297
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?

626
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:11,718
- Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
- I'm here to be fired, right?

627
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,972
Well, we're here to talk about
your future.

628
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,142
You don't have to sugarcoat it.
I get the drill.

629
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,018
What are they offering?

630
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,813
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.

631
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,940
Give me the bullet points.

632
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,317
It's actually pretty good.

633
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,653
Three months' pay, six months' medical

634
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,656
and a full year of placement services
through our company, CTC.

635
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,534
Placement services. That's generous.

636
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,081
Commonly, it takes one month of
searching for every $10,000

637
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,332
you expect to earn in salary.

638
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,918
So, I could be looking for a while.

639
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,087
- Not necessarily.
- Don't even sweat it.

640
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,173
I'm pretty confident about my plans.

641
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,758
- Really?
- Yeah.

642
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,179
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.

643
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,931
I'm gonna go jump off it.

644
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,934
Natalie.

645
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,436
Hey!

646
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,146
Natalie!

647
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,574
People say these things all the time.

648
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,242
It's part of the trade.

649
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,827
- They do?
- Yeah.

650
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,580
I mean, they say crazy things.

651
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,874
They get worked up.

652
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,835
She was really calm.

653
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,463
I think that's a good sign.

654
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,798
So, they don't ever actually do it?

655
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,884
No. No, it's just talk.

656
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,470
How do you know? Do you follow up?

657
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,640
I mean, no.
Nothing good's gonna come of that.

658
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,101
I wouldn't worry about it.

659
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,021
This is what we do, Natalie.

660
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,983
We take people at their most fragile,
and we set them adrift.

661
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,324
You ready to go back in?

662
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,410
All right, let's go. Come on.

663
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,416
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.

664
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,835
I'll be back soon.

665
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,171
I'm not really sure how long
this whole exercise is supposed to last.

666
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,716
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.

667
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,966
I'm done?

668
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,052
I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.

669
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,136
Just like that?

670
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,015
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...

671
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,433
This is not fair.

672
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,894
There are people that are gonna be
way more qualified than me now.

673
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,271
I don't know what to do when I wake up
in the morning tomorrow.

674
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,739
Are you okay?

675
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,410
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

676
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,931
This is how I start every day of my life.

677
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,395
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,
so stay with me.

678
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,397
You have a new backpack.

679
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,900
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.

680
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,529
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,

681
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,906
folks around the office.

682
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,074
And then you move into the people

683
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,159
that you trust with
your most intimate secrets.

684
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,912
Your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

685
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,873
your brothers, your sisters,
your parents.

686
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,504
And finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

687
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,508
You get them into that backpack.

688
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,263
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
to light it on fire.

689
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,808
Feel the weight of that bag.

690
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,103
Make no mistake,
your relationships are the heaviest

691
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,230
components in your life.

692
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,277
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?

693
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:27,200
All those negotiations and arguments
and secrets and compromises.

694
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,832
You don't need to carry all that weight.

695
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,626
Why don't you set that bag down?

696
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,047
Some animals were meant
to carry each other,

697
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,800
to live symbiotically for a lifetime.

698
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,970
Star-crossed lovers,
monogamous swans.

699
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,055
We are not those animals.

700
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,311
The slower we move, the faster we die.

701
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,563
We are not swans.

702
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,733
We're sharks.

703
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,373
- Never?
- No.

704
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,417
- Ever?
- No.

705
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,420
- You never want to get married?
- Nope.

706
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,839
- Never want kids?
- Not a chance.

707
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,758
- Ever?
- Never.

708
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:28,261
- Is that so bizarre?
- Yes.

709
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,138
Yes, it is.

710
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,058
I just don't see the value in it.

711
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,394
- All right, sell it to me.
- What?

712
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,271
Sell me marriage.

713
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:42,442
- Okay, how about love?
- Okay.

714
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,363
Stability, just somebody
you can count on.

715
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,448
How many stable marriages
do you know?

716
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,451
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.

717
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:55,539
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
I doubt that's going to change.

718
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,792
How about just not dying alone?

719
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,585
Starting when I was 12,

720
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,338
we moved each one of
my grandparents into a nursing facility.

721
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,215
My parents went the same way.

722
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,801
Make no mistake, we all die alone.

723
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,806
Now, those cult members in San Diego
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers,

724
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,058
they didn't die alone.

725
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,769
I'm just saying there are options.

726
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,232
Fuck.

727
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,277
Brian left me.

728
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,286
All right.

729
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,331
Okay, okay. All right.

730
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,793
All right.

731
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,213
Yeah.

732
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,679
Hey.

733
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,978
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.

734
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,481
I should give you both a moment.

735
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,317
No. No, that's fine.

736
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,111
I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.

737
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,866
Maybe we should just all go up
to our rooms and freshen up.

738
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,618
Or maybe a drink?

739
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,785
Now you're talking.

740
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,791
He broke up with you
over text message?

741
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,170
It's kind of like firing someone
over the Internet.

742
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,173
What a weaselly prick.

743
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,425
Yeah. But what does that make me?

744
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,053
- Someone who falls for a prick.
- We all fall for them.

745
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,930
Pricks are spontaneous,
they're unpredictable, and they're fun.

746
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,309
And then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.

747
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,478
I followed him to Omaha.

748
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,979
You did?

749
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,814
I had a job waiting for me
in San Francisco

750
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,400
when he got an offer from ConAgra.

751
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,029
He said we could start a life together.

752
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,740
So, I followed him.

753
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,283
To Nebraska?

754
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,580
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

755
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,832
No offense.

756
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,293
- None taken.
- That's all right.

757
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,673
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,

758
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,466
maybe have a kid,

759
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,594
corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

760
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,596
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.

761
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,599
Yeah, life can underwhelm you that way.

762
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:23,019
I mean, where did you think
you'd be by...

763
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,440
It doesn't work that way.

764
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,567
At a certain point,
you stop with the deadlines.

765
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,403
It can be a little counterproductive.

766
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,488
I don't want to say anything
that's anti-feminist.

767
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,908
I really appreciate everything
that your generation did for me.

768
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,493
- It was our pleasure.
- Well done.

769
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,538
But sometimes it feels like
no matter how much success I have,

770
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,249
it's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.

771
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,585
You really thought this guy
was the one?

772
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,963
I could have made it work.

773
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,174
He... He really fit the bill.

774
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,760
- You know?
- The bill?

775
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,804
White-collar, college grad,

776
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,809
loves dogs, likes funny movies,
6'1 ", brown hair, kind eyes,

777
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:07,021
works in finance but is outdoorsy,
you know, on the weekends.

778
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:14,821
I always imagined he'd have a single
syllable name like Matt or John or Dave.

779
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,241
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner.

780
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,162
And the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden Lab.

781
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,165
And a nice smile.

782
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,336
- What about you?
- Let me think.

783
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,216
You know, honestly,
by the time you're 34,

784
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,052
all the physical requirements
just go out the window.

785
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:42,015
I mean, like, you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you,

786
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,642
and not an asshole would be nice.

787
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,604
Just someone who enjoys my company,
comes from a good family.

788
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,398
Because you don't think about that
when you're younger.

789
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,276
I don't know. Someone who wants kids.

790
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,196
Likes kids. Wants kids.

791
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,866
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

792
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,247
Please let him earn more money
than I do.

793
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,292
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.

794
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,212
Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster.

795
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,466
And hopefully some hair on his head,

796
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:20,386
but, I mean, even that's not
a deal breaker these days.

797
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,391
A nice smile.

798
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,730
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.

799
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,735
Wow, that was depressing.

800
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,114
- I should just date women.
- Tried it.

801
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,909
We're no picnic ourselves.

802
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,957
I don't mind being married to my career,

803
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:53,837
and I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.

804
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,051
I just don't want to settle.

805
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:04,389
You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of a failure.

806
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,141
It is, by definition.

807
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:12,313
Yeah. But by the time someone is right
for you, it won't feel like settling.

808
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,857
And the only person left to judge you

809
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,652
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.

810
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,908
So, what's the plan for the evening?

811
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,454
Well, we were gonna hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.

812
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,248
I didn't know you could just attend those.

813
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,542
I thought you had to be registered.

814
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,002
Well, technically, I don't think

815
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,796
- it's open to the public.
- Just gonna stop by.

816
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,299
You're gonna crash it?

817
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,968
- They throw a really nice party.
- Well, they have more money

818
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,470
- than they know what to do with.
- And they have a good time, usually.

819
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,806
No, no, I get it. I'm in.

820
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,370
Jennifer Chu?

821
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,998
- Shit!
- It'll be fine.

822
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,356
Doing all right?

823
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,276
Yeah. This was a great idea.

824
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,155
You're so pretty.

825
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,368
You're exactly
what I wanna look like in 15 years.

826
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,578
Thank you, Natalie.

827
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,538
You should dance.

828
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,377
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

829
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,003
Come on.

830
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,065
- Hi. I'm Dave.
- I'm Natalie.

831
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,776
Who's Jennifer?

832
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,946
I don't know.

833
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,200
All right.
How's everybody doing out there?

834
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,247
All right. Right about now, give it up
for a very special alphaTECH guest.

835
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,416
Young MC!

836
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,628
What's up, alphaTECH?

837
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,298
I got a busted computer at home.
Can somebody fix it for me?

838
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,042
Bust a move!

839
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,501
- Say, "Yeah!"
- Yeah!

840
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,795
- Say, "Oh, yeah!"
- Oh, yeah!

841
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,922
- Say, "Bust a move!"
- Bust a move!

842
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,549
- Say, "Bust a move!"
- Bust a move!

843
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,093
- Let me hear you say, "Yeah!"
- Yeah!

844
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,975
I want you to have a key to my place.

845
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,774
Wow. I had no idea we were
at that point in our relationship.

846
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,609
- Yes.
- Wow.

847
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,615
Where is she?

848
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,410
Lying in my bed I hear the

849
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:58,081
Clock tick and think of you

850
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,125
Caught up in circles

851
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,421
Confusion is nothing new

852
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:06,923
Flash back

853
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,175
To warm nights

854
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,844
Almost left behind

855
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,766
Suitcase of memories

856
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,434
Time after

857
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,354
Sometimes you picture me...

858
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,820
Back home I don't get to act the way
I do with you.

859
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:32,782
- That's why I don't have a back home.
- I know.

860
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,700
You're so cool.

861
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,203
Mr. Empty Backpack.

862
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,498
- You know about my backpack?
- I googled you.

863
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,833
You did?

864
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,460
It's what us modern girls do
when we have a crush.

865
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,296
Did it bother you?

866
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,548
It depends.

867
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,925
Is the bag empty
because you hate people

868
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,094
or because you hate the baggage
that they come along with?

869
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,638
I don't hate people.
I'm not exactly a hermit.

870
00:57:55,722 --> 00:58:00,226
You just don't want to be tied down
with the whole responsibility thing?

871
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,813
I don't know what originally sparked
the backpack.

872
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,898
Probably needed to be alone.

873
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,404
Recently, I've been thinking
that I needed to empty the backpack

874
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,657
before I knew what to put back in it.

875
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,220
- Oh, no!
- I think we're out of gas.

876
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,971
Hey. You're up?

877
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,142
Yeah, I have to fly standby
and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

878
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,270
Okay.

879
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,857
I made you feel cheap.

880
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,986
It's all right.
Just leave the money on the dresser.

881
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,823
I'll text you later
so we can swap schedules.

882
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:42,328
Hey.

883
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,040
I really like you.

884
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,419
- I like you, too.
- Good.

885
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,632
Go catch your plane.

886
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,854
Last night...

887
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,650
It was kind of out of hand,
and I said things...

888
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:17,238
I'm not actually sure of everything
that I said,

889
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,116
- but I didn't want you to think...
- Just relax.

890
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,702
It was nice to see you cut loose.

891
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,329
So, did you wake him up or slip out?

892
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:29,792
- What?
- This morning. Your new friend.

893
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,377
Did you wake him up
for an awkward goodbye

894
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,547
or did you just slip out
and make him feel like a whore?

895
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,677
- I just left.
- Protocol's always tricky.

896
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,849
What happened to Alex?

897
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,018
She had to leave town early
to get to a meeting.

898
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:50,271
- That's too bad. Where does she live?
- Chicago.

899
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,065
Thinking of going to see her?

900
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,484
We don't really have that
kind of relationship. Try right over there.

901
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,153
That direction.

902
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,906
What kind of relationship do you have?

903
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,534
Well, you know, casual.

904
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,413
- Sounds pretty special.
- It works for us.

905
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,126
Don't you think there's a future there?

906
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,503
I never really thought about it.
What's going on here?

907
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,131
- Really never thought about it?
- No.

908
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,010
How can you not think about that?

909
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,595
How does it not even cross your mind

910
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,388
that you might want
a future with someone?

911
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,516
It's simple. You know that moment
when you look into somebody's eyes

912
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,894
and you can feel them
staring into your soul

913
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,522
and the whole world goes quiet
just for a second?

914
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,816
- Yes.
- Right. Well, I don't.

915
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,070
- You're an asshole.
- No.

916
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,988
Look, I'm just dicking around. Come on.
Give me a hand.

917
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,531
Don't you think it's worth
giving her a chance?

918
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,368
- A chance to what?
- A chance at something real.

919
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,162
Natalie, your definition of real
is going to evolve as you get older.

920
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,164
Can you stop condescending
for one second

921
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,833
or is that one of the principles
of your bullshit philosophy?

922
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,544
- Bullshit philosophy?
- The isolation, the traveling.

923
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,172
- Is that supposed to be charming?
- No, it's simply a life choice.

924
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,509
- It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
- Wow. Big words.

925
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,177
Screw you.

926
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,012
Screw you, too.

927
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,598
You have set up a way of life
that basically makes it impossible

928
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,600
for you to have any kind of
human connection.

929
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,018
And now this woman comes along

930
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:14,522
and somehow runs the gauntlet
of your ridiculous life choice

931
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:18,192
and comes out on the other end smiling
just so you can call her "casual"?

932
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,070
I need to grow up? You're a 12-year-old.

933
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,656
I don't have a gauntlet...

934
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:27,993
Fuck.

935
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,787
Now, listen,
these Detroit guys can be tough.

936
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:12,997
They've been getting hammered.

937
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,124
So, you don't get distracted.
Stick with the simple stuff.

938
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,545
You get these packets in their hand
and you get them out the door, okay?

939
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,560
Hey, welcome to Detroit.

940
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,312
What's going on here?

941
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,439
I've been looking at those
great numbers over the last few days.

942
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,774
I thought maybe we should just nut up
and give this a try.

943
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,151
We could use a little more time.

944
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,154
Well, you got to leave the nest
at some point, huh?

945
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,865
This is a real company, Craig.
We're here to do some damage.

946
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,159
I know. It's a good thing
we brought our best, okay.

947
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,702
Let's stop screwing around.

948
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,872
All right. Just give me a minute
to prepare and get my things together.

949
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:58,334
I was thinking that Natalie
was going to take this one.

950
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,919
She's hardly ready for that.

951
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,213
I've been watching her results
the last few days. She's great.

952
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,672
This is a whole other animal.

953
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,799
You know, she created it
and everything, right?

954
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,260
Natalie, are you not up for it?

955
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,848
- Yeah, I'm game.
- That's my girl.

956
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:18,437
Just remember, don't apologize,
don't tell them how hard this is for you.

957
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,856
Today's one of the worst days
they're ever gonna have in their life.

958
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,442
How we feel doesn't even compare.

959
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,362
- Got it.
- All right. Just keep it professional.

960
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,947
You'll be fine.

961
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,911
What's all this? What's going on?

962
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:37,748
Hello, Mr. Samuels.
I wish I were here with better news.

963
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:43,462
However, your position here
at Wertheimer's is no longer available.

964
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,756
What are you talking about?

965
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,634
You've been let go.

966
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,303
Just like that?

967
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,682
Who are you?

968
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,060
My name is Miss Keener,

969
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,854
and I'm here today
to talk about your options.

970
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,691
I worked for this company for 17 years

971
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,485
and they send a fourth-grader
to can me?

972
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,822
What the fuck is this?

973
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,542
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

974
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,253
However, the sooner you can
tell yourself that greater

975
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,088
- opportunities are waiting for you...
- Greater opportunities?

976
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,424
I'm 57 fucking years old.

977
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,846
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

978
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,347
sat where you are now.

979
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,437
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

980
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:49,570
There's a packet in front of you. I want
you to take some time and review it.

981
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,700
All the answers you're looking for
are inside those pages.

982
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,205
The sooner you trust the process,

983
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,959
the sooner the next step of your life
will unveil itself.

984
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,926
I need you to go back to your office now

985
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:16,096
and start putting together
your personal things.

986
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,909
Mr. Samuels,
that's all we can discuss now.

987
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,706
Mr. Samuels.

988
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,300
Mr. Samuels.

989
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,847
Mr. Samuels!

990
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,699
You did good.

991
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,578
You okay? You want me to take over?

992
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,580
No, I'm all right.

993
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,390
No. Look, we just got here.

994
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,226
That's one place.
I think we need to try a few more.

995
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,437
Maybe it doesn't make a difference,

996
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,022
but it's comforting to know
that we're in the next room.

997
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:52,234
I know you don't give a shit
about my comfort.

998
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,904
I think we could try a few more,
that's all I'm saying.

999
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:00,909
Fine.

1000
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,498
All right. Okay. All right.

1001
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:17,760
He thought you did a great job.
You did. I'm real proud of you.

1002
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,179
Thanks.

1003
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,184
They're pulling us off the road.

1004
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,520
We're going home.

1005
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,315
Really? For good?

1006
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,650
Yeah.

1007
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,279
Good job.

1008
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,975
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex.
That was out of line.

1009
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,977
It's all right. I understand.

1010
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:12,648
I mean, who am I to be doling out
relationship advice, right?

1011
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,149
No kidding.

1012
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,531
Are you gonna be okay?

1013
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,575
- What do you mean?
- In Omaha?

1014
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,121
I don't know.

1015
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,626
It's better than you'd think.

1016
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,303
Ryan.

1017
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,973
Ryan. Where are you going?

1018
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,725
I'm grabbing another flight.
Something I've got to take care of.

1019
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,936
I'll see you back at home.

1020
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,708
Okay, just walk it in a little.

1021
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,626
A little more.

1022
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,379
There you go. Yeah.

1023
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,384
Got it.

1024
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,973
They're a cute couple.

1025
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:31,310
- You think so?
- Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

1026
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,314
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

1027
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,275
I like it if you're there.

1028
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,319
And I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

1029
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,279
Northern Wisconsin.

1030
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,408
What are you doing this weekend?

1031
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,828
- No.
- What, I haven't...

1032
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:53,707
- Well, you want me to be your date?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1033
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,711
- At your sister's wedding?
- It's not like I know her that well.

1034
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,881
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

1035
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,259
But for the first time in my life,
I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

1036
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,137
I want a dance partner.
I want a "plus one."

1037
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,557
And if you can stomach it,
I'd like it to be you.

1038
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,043
Excuse me. Are you available?

1039
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,838
This line's for members
of our Matterhorn Program.

1040
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:48,845
Hey. Ryan.

1041
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,808
- Hey.
- Kara. Hi.

1042
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,185
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

1043
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,812
Alex, this is my sister Kara.

1044
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,563
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

1045
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,734
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

1046
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,238
So, you two are dating?

1047
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,284
- Not exactly.
- Well, hey, don't worry about it.

1048
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,621
We're all getting a little old
to be calling someone girlfriend.

1049
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:17,165
I remember when Mom
used to call Jack her boyfriend.

1050
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,169
God. Drove me up the wall.
Boyfriends are for kids, right?

1051
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,881
So, what are you doing at the hotel?

1052
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:30,554
Yeah. Okay, Frank and I are trying out
a trial separation.

1053
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,681
I'm sorry.
So, you're not staying at the house?

1054
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,766
No, there was a room on hold here,

1055
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,686
so I thought I'd just take it
for the weekend.

1056
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:43,483
- So, the rehearsal dinner.
- Yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.

1057
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,364
Nice digs.

1058
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,202
There's a packet.

1059
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,419
Hey, look who's here.

1060
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,504
- Oh, my God!
- He finally made it.

1061
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,715
- Oh, my God! Ryan!
- Hey.

1062
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:09,801
Hi.

1063
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:14,389
- You must be Alex.
- Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?

1064
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:17,434
- You are so beautiful. Kara was right.
- Thank you.

1065
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:23,774
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

1066
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,068
I do?
You're the one that's getting married.

1067
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,903
I know, right?

1068
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,448
You haven't even seen my ring.

1069
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,743
- Look at that.
- It's lovely.

1070
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,454
- Jim designed it.
- That's...

1071
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,039
Hey, Jim.

1072
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,335
- Hey.
- How's it going?

1073
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,962
- Hey. I'm Ryan.
- Jim. Good to meet you.

1074
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,173
- Alex. Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

1075
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,426
Thank you, guys, for coming.

1076
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,220
Brother!

1077
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,933
- It's true, though.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

1078
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,103
I got the pictures you asked me to get.

1079
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:03,688
You can just put them right there.

1080
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,359
Yeah, okay.

1081
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,849
You got so many of them up there,
I almost didn't have room.

1082
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:42,144
I know. It's so great.
Everyone just chipped in.

1083
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,981
What gave you the idea
to do something so...

1084
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,065
Substantial.

1085
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:53,113
Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate venture.

1086
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,866
It's a real estate investment.

1087
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,910
It's exciting,
but we went over our finances and...

1088
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,912
A honeymoon just kind of at this state
in the game

1089
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,998
just doesn't really seem affordable.

1090
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,250
So, you know, we just thought,

1091
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:08,920
"Just because we can't travel
doesn't mean we can't have pictures."

1092
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,631
- No, I think that's a fabulous idea.
- Yeah, it's a good one.

1093
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,467
I mean,
the concept is turnkey everything.

1094
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,053
Okay? You buy a maintenance contract
when you get the home.

1095
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,472
You know, we'll whack your weeds,
we'll change your light bulbs.

1096
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,932
Furniture, you can bring your own

1097
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,226
or else you can pick one
of our beautiful packages.

1098
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:26,021
Seamless traditionalism,
yet all the perks.

1099
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,355
Nice.

1100
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,191
And we all need a place to call our own.

1101
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,402
This is America.
This is what we were promised.

1102
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,197
- It's a nice touch.
- What?

1103
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,533
The bit at the end about the promise.
I like that part.

1104
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:40,285
Thanks.

1105
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:46,249
You... You still renting
that one-bedroom?

1106
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,878
- No. I gave it up.
- So, you own now?

1107
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,088
- No.
- But you're looking?

1108
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,883
No, not really.

1109
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,136
So, you're just good?

1110
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,222
I'm good.

1111
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,307
Well, that's good.

1112
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,727
Can you believe it's tomorrow?
How are you gonna sleep?

1113
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,312
I don't know.

1114
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,316
- Well, do you want some Xanax?
- I don't think that's for sleeping.

1115
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,153
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have
a glass of warm milk.

1116
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,031
- That'll do the trick.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

1117
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,407
- Okay.
- Bye.

1118
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,492
Bye.

1119
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,911
Hey. There's another box inside.

1120
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,704
- I'll grab it.
- You sure?

1121
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,927
- Jim seems like a good guy.
- Yeah, isn't he great?

1123
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,680
He's going to make a great husband.

1124
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,267
You know, Julie, I was thinking,

1125
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,103
you know, with Dad not being here,

1126
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:53,692
I was wondering if you had anybody
to walk you down the aisle.

1127
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,695
Yeah.

1128
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,532
No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.

1129
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,159
He's been really supportive.

1130
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,120
He's been great.

1131
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:08,331
Well, good. That's great.
I just wanted to make sure that you...

1132
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,043
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

1133
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,632
So, I should be there, what?

1134
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:20,135
Yeah, the guests
are arriving around 5:00,

1135
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,306
and things get going at 5:30,
so around then.

1136
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,765
Okay.

1137
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,564
Let me... I'm gonna help you with those.

1138
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,566
Got it.

1139
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,069
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1140
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,165
None of that was here.

1141
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,000
This is all new.

1142
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,512
Really?

1143
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,849
- Is that all you got?
- What?

1144
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,108
Give me a boost.

1145
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,445
Watch...

1146
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:22,864
Hang on.

1147
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,831
I took Geography in here.

1148
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,502
You ever fool around
with one of your teachers?

1149
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,630
- No. Did you?
- No. Not until college.

1150
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,304
That's me on the right.

1151
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,266
It's kind of hard to tell.

1152
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,811
You can tell by the eyebrows.

1153
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,022
- You played basketball?
- I was a point guard.

1154
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,565
Don't act so surprised.

1155
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,235
I didn't know you were such a jock.

1156
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,695
That's me, too.

1157
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,323
And that.

1158
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,245
- My first fight.
- How'd it go?

1159
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,080
Got my ass kicked.

1160
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,667
This is where we used to go
to make out.

1161
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,587
Yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.

1162
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:27,595
Go, Cougars!

1163
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,562
I'm really happy I came here.

1164
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,272
So am I.

1165
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,446
It's Kara.

1166
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,532
- Hey.
- Ryan, where are you?

1167
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,242
We're having a meltdown here.

1168
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,410
What's going on? What happened?

1169
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,912
It's Jim. Can you get back here?
We need your help.

1170
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:54,289
Okay.

1171
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,542
We got to go.

1172
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,006
- I'll grab your suit.
- Thanks.

1173
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,487
- What happened?
- Jim's got cold feet.

1174
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,448
- Today?
- Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

1175
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,117
- What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

1176
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:34,245
- You want me to talk to him?
- Hey, it's either you or me.

1177
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,998
You know my track record.
I've already struck out once.

1178
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,334
I haven't been to bat.
I haven't been in the dugout.

1179
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,794
Don't you talk for a living?
Motivational-type stuff?

1180
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:44,088
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

1181
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,341
What kind of
fucked-up message is that?

1182
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,884
- It's a philosophy.
- It's stupid.

1183
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,761
Hey, it could have helped you.

1184
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:55,725
Ryan, you haven't been around much.
Fuck, basically, you don't exist to us.

1185
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,978
I know you wanna be there for her.

1186
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,815
Well, here it is. This is your chance.

1187
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,673
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

1188
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,718
- Jim.
- You ever read this before?

1189
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:35,473
- Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
- Yeah, I'll say.

1190
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,982
Kara mentioned that
you were having some thoughts.

1191
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,820
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.

1192
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,574
And why would you say that today?

1193
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:58,413
Well, last night I was kind of laying
in bed and I couldn't get to sleep,

1194
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,790
so I started thinking about the wedding
and the ceremony,

1195
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:04,794
and about our buying a house
and moving in together,

1196
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,755
and having a kid
and then having another kid.

1197
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,759
And then Christmas
and Thanksgiving and spring break

1198
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,179
and going to football games. And then,
all of a sudden, they're graduating,

1199
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,098
they're getting jobs,
and they're getting married,

1200
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,434
and, you know, I'm a grandparent.

1201
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:23,021
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair.
I'm getting fat.

1202
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,315
And then the next thing you know,
I'm dead.

1203
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,360
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking,
"What's the point?"

1204
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,909
- I mean, what is the point?
- The point?

1205
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:39,662
Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?

1206
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:44,125
Jim, it's marriage.

1207
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:49,881
It's one of the most beautiful things
on earth. It's what people aspire to.

1208
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,134
- You never got married.
- That's true.

1209
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:57,096
- I mean, you never even tried.
- Well, it's hard to define try.

1210
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,640
I don't know, just...

1211
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,892
You seem happier
than all my married friends.

1212
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:07,190
Look, Jim, I'm not gonna lie to you.
Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

1213
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:12,153
And you're kind of right. This all is just
stuff that leads to your eventual demise.

1214
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,322
- Yes.
- And we're all on running clocks,

1215
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,574
and they can't be slowed down
or paused,

1216
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:20,161
and, you know,
we all end up in the same place.

1217
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,579
Yeah.

1218
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:24,624
There is no point.

1219
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,418
There is no point.
That's what I'm saying.

1220
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,133
You know,

1221
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,680
I'm not normally the guy
you would talk to about stuff like this.

1222
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,811
If you think about it,

1223
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:50,983
your favorite memories, the most
important moments in your life,

1224
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:52,610
were you alone?

1225
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:56,197
No, I guess not.

1226
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:01,202
Hey, come to think of it, last night,
the night before your wedding,

1227
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,204
when all this shit
is swirling around in your head,

1228
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,540
weren't you guys
sleeping in separate bedrooms?

1229
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,458
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment,

1230
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,628
and I was just by myself
in the honeymoon suite.

1231
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:13,965
- Kind of lonely, huh?
- Yes, it was pretty lonely.

1232
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:19,971
- Life's better with company.
- Yeah.

1233
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,266
Everybody needs a co-pilot.

1234
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,687
- That was a nice touch.
- Thanks.

1235
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,736
- So, what's the mood like out there?
- It's not good.

1236
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,905
- She's pretty pissed?
- She's upset.

1237
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,410
What should I do?

1238
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,705
Go get her.

1239
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,681
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.

1240
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,392
Will you be my co-pilot?

1241
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:10,563
Yes. Yes.

1242
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,820
Welcome home.

1243
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,686
Okay, this is your stop.

1244
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:07,114
- When am I gonna see you?
- You're just gonna have to come visit.

1245
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,492
So settled.

1246
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,204
You're not gonna change on me,
are you?

1247
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,791
No. Same guy. Just one address.

1248
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,086
This is your final boarding call

1249
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:23,214
for American Airlines
flight number 3972 to Chicago.

1250
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,969
All right. Call me when you get lonely.

1251
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,640
I'm lonely.

1252
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,967
Some guy sits down
in a conference room somewhere

1253
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:11,595
and our server routes his session
to one of our termination engineers.

1254
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,514
"Termination engineers"? Really?

1255
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:16,058
I preferred "terminators,"
but it bumped with Legal.

1256
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,601
Can't imagine why.

1257
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,687
They follow a workflow
that takes them through anything

1258
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,313
from a standard dismissal
to a violent aggressor.

1259
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,941
What are they doing now?
Are they practicing?

1260
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:27,445
Well, beta testing, role-playing.
We go live at the end of the month.

1261
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,406
Kyle, you're running through the events
too quickly.

1262
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,658
You need to give them time
to acknowledge each statement, okay?

1263
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,493
It's a legal thing.

1264
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,455
- Ryan?
- Yeah. There's more?

1265
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,714
This is ridiculous.

1266
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,841
But, you know, Legal's really starting to
come hard at me

1267
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,635
on this term "terminate," so...

1268
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:31,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1269
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:35,096
for today's challenge speaker,
Mr. Ryan Bingham.

1270
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,849
Go get them.

1271
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,404
Last year, I flew 350,000 miles.

1272
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,741
The moon is 250.

1273
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:03,457
I want you to imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

1274
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:06,252
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

1275
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,712
You feel them?

1276
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:14,885
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

1277
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:21,225
Start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers.

1278
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,830
Excuse me.

1279
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,252
What the fuck are you doing?

1280
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,421
Okay, everyone, just relax.

1281
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:18,115
- Hey, you gotta sign.
- Thought I did that already.

1282
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,535
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

1283
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,750
Hey, you forgot to give me
your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

1284
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:05,412
So, I was in the neighborhood.

1285
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:11,460
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, wait.

1286
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:24,390
- Hey, honey, who's at the door?
- It's just somebody who's lost.

1287
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,700
Alex?

1288
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,745
What were you thinking,
showing up at my door like that?

1289
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,997
What do you mean? I...
I wanted to see you.

1290
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:33,000
I didn't know you had a family.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1291
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,335
Look, I'm sorry I ruined your evening,

1292
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,670
but, I mean, you could have seriously
screwed things up for me.

1293
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,299
That's my family. That's my real life.

1294
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,346
I thought I was a part of your real life.

1295
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,141
I thought we signed up
for the same thing.

1296
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:55,105
Try and help me understand
exactly what it is that you signed up for.

1297
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:59,485
I thought our relationship
was perfectly clear.

1298
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:03,447
I mean, you are an escape.

1299
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:10,162
You're a break from our normal lives.
You're a parenthesis.

1300
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,876
I'm a parenthesis?

1301
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,169
I mean...

1302
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:22,299
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

1303
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,307
You don't even know what you want.

1304
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:35,020
I'm a grown-up, okay?

1305
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:39,525
So, if you would like to see me again,
then give me a call.

1306
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:42,694
Okay?

1307
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,089
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a special announcement to make.

1308
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:06,593
Our pilot has just informed me that we
are passing over the city of Dubuque,

1309
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,263
which might not mean much
to most of you,

1310
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:11,890
but means a lot
to one of our flyers today.

1311
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:16,854
- Oh, no.
- Because he just hit 10 million miles!

1312
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:22,109
Congratulations.

1313
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:25,737
- Such an amazing accomplishment.
- You must be very, very excited.

1314
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:29,032
- Hi, Captain.
- Captain.

1315
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,826
That seat taken?

1316
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,120
No. No.

1317
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,421
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

1318
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:48,844
- Don't know where you found the time.
- Yeah. I don't know.

1319
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:51,972
Oh, yeah.

1320
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,560
Here you go.

1321
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:02,733
Seventh card we've made. Small club.

1322
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:08,655
We really appreciate your loyalty.

1323
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,828
You know how many times
I thought about this moment?

1324
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,501
Played out the conversation
that you and I would have right here.

1325
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:21,877
Really?

1326
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:26,924
What did you want to say?

1327
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,889
You know, I don't remember.

1328
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,269
That's all right. It happens to all of us.

1329
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,776
So, where are you from?

1330
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,492
I'm from here.

1331
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,845
Hello, Mr. Bingham.

1332
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,308
- How did you know it was me?
- This is your dedicated line.

1333
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:21,728
We reserve them for our most loyal
and appreciated flyers.

1334
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,605
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.

1335
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,858
Can I open up an account
to Jim and Julie Miller?

1336
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:29,945
Certainly. How many miles
would you like to transfer?

1337
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,698
How many miles does it take
to circle the globe?

1338
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:36,910
We have our round-the-world tickets.
They're 500,000 miles each.

1339
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:38,662
- That'd be fine.
- Got a second?

1340
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,038
I'll call you back.

1341
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,164
What the hell happened
to you yesterday?

1342
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:42,916
I was trying to get hold of you all day.

1343
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:46,420
I was... Some personal stuff.
What's going on?

1344
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,797
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

1345
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:53,385
part of a 30-person reduction
a few weeks back in Wichita?

1346
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,220
Natalie fired her.

1347
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:58,015
I fire dozens of people a day. I...

1348
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,851
She killed herself, jumped off a bridge.

1349
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,104
Fuck.

1350
01:39:04,564 --> 01:39:06,064
I need to know

1351
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:10,110
if you remember any woman
that gave you any signals, depression...

1352
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:11,778
They're all depressed.
We're firing them.

1353
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,698
Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, okay?

1354
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:18,869
No, I don't remember anything.
You never think that they're...

1355
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:23,206
You don't remember any woman
that gave you any signals?

1356
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:26,543
- Anything at all, Ryan?
- No, nothing stands out.

1357
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,966
- Natalie all right?
- Natalie quit.

1358
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,057
- She quit?
- Text message.

1359
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:44,645
Yeah, fucking nice, right?
No one's got any manners anymore.

1360
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:49,399
- She say where she was going?
- No. She was a little upset.

1361
01:39:51,778 --> 01:39:53,904
I should give her a call.

1362
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,159
I need you back in the air.

1363
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,249
Hey, did you hear what I said?
I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

1364
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,877
It's fine.
What about the videoconferencing?

1365
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:12,631
CTC is going to pause
the new-media front.

1366
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,133
They're gonna give it
some more thought.

1367
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:17,135
We are gonna get
our workhorses back in the air,

1368
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,554
doing what they do best, okay?

1369
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:25,143
- How long are you sending me out?
- We're gonna let you sail and sail.

1370
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:28,230
You send us a postcard
if you ever get there.

1371
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:44,287
So, what happened?

1372
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:49,876
- How exactly do you mean?
- You graduated top of your class.

1373
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:53,213
You seemed to have your pick
of employment, including right here.

1374
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:56,717
Instead you went to Omaha
to fire people for a living?

1375
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:01,096
- It's challenging work.
- I'll say.

1376
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:05,225
I can't imagine doing that day in,
day out.

1377
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,060
Not in this climate.

1378
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,148
I followed a boy.

1379
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:18,155
Well, I guess everybody does that
at one point or another.

1380
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:26,538
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

1381
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,124
To whom it may concern,

1382
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:32,419
I can't even count the number of people
I've fired in my lifetime.

1383
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:36,339
So many that I've actually forgotten
what it's like to hire somebody.

1384
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:40,385
We've never met, but I know
you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.

1385
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,181
My advice?
Take her and don't look back.

1386
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:47,142
She'll be the best decision
you've made in a long time.

1387
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:53,648
I sure hope he's right.

1388
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,120
Well, I don't have a lot of hope,

1389
01:42:07,205 --> 01:42:09,956
and I really don't know
when it's gonna get better.

1390
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:12,793
There's a lot of people unemployed,

1391
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:17,005
and I really don't know when there's
gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

1392
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:19,800
I can't find much to talk about.

1393
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,219
Talk about being proud.
I'm proud of my kids.

1394
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:27,766
I think the anger comes from the fact
that I just wasn't needed anymore.

1395
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,768
I would say, you know,

1396
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:34,564
without my friends and my family,
I wouldn't have made it.

1397
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:37,442
It would have been a lot tougher if
I would have had to make it on my own.

1398
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:41,530
When I wake up in the morning
and I look over and I see my wife,

1399
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:44,574
that gives me the sense of purpose.

1400
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:47,786
It's not all about the money.
Money can keep you warm.

1401
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:51,248
It pays your heating bills, you know.
It can buy you a blanket.

1402
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:56,837
But it's not as... Doesn't keep you as
warm as when my husband holds me.

1403
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:01,258
Let me get up. Let me get out.
Let me find something.

1404
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:06,054
So, my kids are my purpose, my family.

1405
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,211
Tonight most people
will be welcomed home

1406
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,797
by jumping dogs and squealing kids.

1407
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:45,844
Their spouses will ask about their day,
and tonight they'll sleep.

1408
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:50,640
The stars will wheel forth
from their daytime hiding places.

1409
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,979
And one of those lights,
slightly brighter than the rest,

1410
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:58,481
will be my wingtip passing over.

1411
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:11,364
Hi, Jason. My name is Kevin,

1412
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:13,825
and I recently lost my job.

1413
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:19,748
I wrote this song as sort of
a statement about uncertainty

1414
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:23,376
and having a certain amount of anxiety
about the future.

1415
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,630
So, maybe you can use it in your movie.
