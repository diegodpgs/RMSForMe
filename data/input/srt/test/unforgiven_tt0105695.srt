00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,505
- You know, Will--
- I ain't the same.

320
00:29:57,008 --> 00:30:01,762
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

321
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,890
Going on this killing...

322
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,226
... don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

323
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,271
Just need the money.

324
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:16,151
- Get a new start for them youngsters.
- Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:22,699
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

326
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:26,036
... and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

327
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:31,541
- Yeah.
- I think about him now and again.

328
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:37,130
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

329
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:41,176
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

330
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,975
NED:
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

331
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,189
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought...

332
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,942
... I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

333
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,405
NED:
You ain't like that no more.

334
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:04,491
Eagle, he hated my guts.

335
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,870
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

336
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,081
NED:
Quincy neither, I reckon.

337
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:16,503
Quincy used to just watch
all the time...

338
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:19,423
... scared.

339
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:22,092

... you ain't like that no more.

341
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:27,848
That's right.

342
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,351
I'm just a fellow now.

343
00:31:31,602 --> 00:31:34,438
I ain't no different
than anyone else...

344
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,440
... no more.

345
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,835
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

346
00:31:57,086 --> 00:32:01,590
ENGLISH BOB: No, the would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

347
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,635
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

348
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,806
... but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

349
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,059
... who can't shoot worth a damn.

350
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,979
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

351
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,984
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-L-T--

352
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:24,905
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

353
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:30,952
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

354
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:35,499
... a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

355
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,462
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

356
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,173
The majesty of royalty, you see.

357
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,179
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

358
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,598
... but you are giving it pretty thick.

359
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,768
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

360
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,771
- When I heard about queens--
THIRSTY: Shut up, Joe.

361
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,774
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude--

362
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,902
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

363
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:07,948
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

364
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:12,035
Might be he's waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol...

365
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:13,912
... so he can shoot him.

366
00:33:25,716 --> 00:33:28,301
Is that a fact, mister?

367
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,220
You English Bob?

369
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,311
Let's shoot some pheasants.

370
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,813
Ten shots.

371
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,816
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

372
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:46,653
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

373
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:48,655
... for whomever.

That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

376
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,013
Pretty damn good shooting...

377
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,931
... for a John Bull.

378
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:19,769
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

379
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:24,107
... over the injury to your president.

does it. And the infernal distances.

W. W. :
Does what?

383
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,211
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

384
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,756
- Yeah, uh... . 
ENGLISH BOB: It's a savage country.

385
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,469
ENGLISH BOB: That's the second one
shot in 20 years.

386
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:56,056
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

Come on.

Thank you.

ANDY:
Pardon me, gentlemen.

391
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:06,376
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

392
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:08,670
Proper authority?

393
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:17,220
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

394
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:21,599
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

395
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:24,227
... and the forbearance of reptiles.

Christ, it's hot!

398
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:46,791
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

399
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:51,171
Everything hurts more when it's cold.

-No.

00:37:05,644 --> 00:37:08,438
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,610
Building his damn porch.

If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?

I ain't gonna get shot.

00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,499
CLYDE:
Of course he's coming.

412
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,709
I just loaded that.

413
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,172
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

414
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:35,590
What'd he say?

415
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:39,010
Little Bill said
he was building his porch.

416
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,597
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

417
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:46,768
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

418

I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

419
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,777
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

420
00:37:56,237 --> 00:38:00,740
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

421
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,076
He didn't say nothing?

422
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,788
Asked what they looked like.

423
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,250
Maybe he's tough, but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,544
Maybe he ain't so tough.

425
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:16,464
Seem like he was scared?

426
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,384
Little Bill? Him scared?

427
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:23,888

00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:34,065
Just wondered.

432
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,944
Anybody could be scared.

433
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,951
He wasn't scared, boys.

434
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:49,164
He just ain't no carpenter.

435
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:56,212
There's a dignity in royalty...

436
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:59,257
... which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

-If you pointed a pistol...

438
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,929
... at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

439
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,725
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

440
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,810
That's a wise policy.

441
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:15,231
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

442
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,776
... would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed.

443
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:20,195
BARBER: Right.
-You would stand--

How shall I put it?
In awe.

Why not shoot a president?

00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:50,850
- Billiards?
- Uh-huh.

I don't really wish to play?

No matter. They burned the

00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:48,205
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

638
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:52,334
... that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts.

639
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:54,211
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

640
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:57,131
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

641
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:00,634
The Duke.

642
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:02,344
Duck, I says.

643
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:14,982
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran... '

644
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:16,483
... said the Duck.

645
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,736
'You must apologize. '

646
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,573
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

647
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:26,243
He reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

648
00:55:26,494 --> 00:55:31,665
... but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns. "

649
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:35,419
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

650
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,048
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

LITTLE BILL:
Mr. Beauchamp.

652
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,430
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

653
00:55:46,764 --> 00:55:50,267
... the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

654
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,186
I didn't see you there.

655
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:54,521
Nor no woman.

656
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:56,899
Nor two-gun shooters.

657
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,902
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

658
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:01,570
LITTLE BILL:
Yeah, I was there.

659
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:05,616
First off...

660
00:56:06,284 --> 00:56:10,037
... Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

661
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:12,289
W. W. :
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

662
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,085
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

663
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:19,296
It was because his dick...

664
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:23,008
... was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

665
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:30,265
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

666
00:56:30,642 --> 00:56:36,063
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what...

667
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:39,816
... Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

668
00:56:40,068 --> 00:56:44,238
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

669
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:47,324
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

670
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:50,160
Meantime, Bob here...

671
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,747
... aims real good
and squeezes off another...

672
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:58,961
... but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1000 mirror over the bar.

673
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:04,967
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

674
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,344
He aims real careful.

675
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:09,596
- No hurry.
- And?

676
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,348
Bam!

677
00:57:12,016 --> 00:57:17,479
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

678
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:23,360
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there...

679
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:26,280
... to defend himself to the end.

680
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:27,990
Wait a minute.

681
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:32,869
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have... .

682
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:37,040
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

683
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:41,044
No, he just
walked over there real slow...

684
00:57:41,504 --> 00:57:43,880
... because he was drunk...

685
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,175
... and shot him
through the liver.

686
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:10,741
NED: Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

- You said that last night.

- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

695
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:56,662
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

Got you dead to rights.

You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

698
00:59:02,669 --> 00:59:05,879
Only took a scratch yourself.

Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it...

700

with, in case we get into a scrape.

709
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,643
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

710
01:00:01,853 --> 01:00:03,687
How many?

711
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,482
Five!

712
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:09,860
I done killed five of them.

713
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:15,240
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

716
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:30,172
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck--

717
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:32,215
Than English Bob?

718
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:35,051
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

719
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:38,889
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

720
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,224
He would've killed old Bob.

Look, son.

722
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:47,647
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

723
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:52,736
... don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

724
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:57,073
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:59,075
... like as not he'll kill you.

- But if the other fellow is quicker--
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

Unless it's a barn.

Not on purpose.

But he started hurting him worse.

First, Ned wouldn't talk.

Then Little Bill hurt him so
bad, he said who you was.

1307
01:51:34,859 --> 01:51:38,987
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1308
01:51:39,155 --> 01:51:42,157
Little Bill said, "The one
who dynamited...

Said you was...
