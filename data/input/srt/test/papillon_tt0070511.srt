That's right. Ha, ha. Nobody.

874
02:12:17,179 --> 02:12:19,847
Do you know who I am?

875
02:12:45,165 --> 02:12:55,049
Dega?

876
02:13:00,138 --> 02:13:01,555
Dega.

877
02:13:12,025 --> 02:13:13,693
Dega?

878
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:40,469
Louis.

879
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:47,727
I wish you hadn't come here.

880
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:00,281
Are you fond of crayfish?

881
02:14:31,938 --> 02:14:33,355
Good.

882
02:14:34,941 --> 02:14:36,692
You really think so?

883
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,529
It's the best I've had in years.

884
02:14:46,328 --> 02:14:47,828
Did you hear about my wife?

885
02:14:49,539 --> 02:14:53,667
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

886
02:14:53,835 --> 02:14:57,171
...although, actually,
it doesn't really matter.

887
02:14:57,339 --> 02:15:01,509
I mean, it all works out to the same thing,
don't you think?

888
02:15:07,724 --> 02:15:12,436
Well, I have not heard from her
in about...

889
02:15:13,855 --> 02:15:16,524
It is nice here, isn't it?

890
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:20,152
You've made it nice, Louis.

891
02:15:21,196 --> 02:15:23,114
Really nice.

892
02:15:26,034 --> 02:15:28,202
Funny...

893
02:15:28,870 --> 02:15:31,705
...you and me ending up here.

894
02:15:32,916 --> 02:15:35,626
We're the only ones left.

895
02:15:38,463 --> 02:15:41,382
- Do you ever wonder about it?
- No.

896
02:15:43,218 --> 02:15:44,885
I do.

897
02:15:47,848 --> 02:15:49,723
Get away!

898
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:54,562
Get away! Get away!

899
02:15:55,063 --> 02:15:56,897
That's enough!

900
02:16:08,743 --> 02:16:10,911
They come and steal from my garden.

901
02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:12,580
Who does?

902
02:16:18,253 --> 02:16:21,589
- Maybe I better go.
- Yes.

903
02:16:24,843 --> 02:16:28,971
I know your house.
There's no ghost in it.

904
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:06,467
My thoughts are with you.

905
02:17:34,955 --> 02:17:36,789
Jesus.

906
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:09,446
Louis. Louis.

907
02:18:09,614 --> 02:18:13,075
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

908
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:15,327
- They've come up. We'll have carrots.
- Louis.

909
02:18:15,495 --> 02:18:18,289
It said six weeks on the packet,
but it's only taken four.

910
02:18:18,456 --> 02:18:22,084
If I could find a way to get off this island,
would you like to come with me?

911
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:23,544
Oh, yes, of course.

912
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:27,172
Get away. Freddie, you know better
than that. Get away.

913
02:18:28,717 --> 02:18:31,885
- I got no money. They took it all.
- Forget about that.

914
02:18:32,053 --> 02:18:34,430
- You can't buy your way out of here.
- Then how?

915
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:37,433
I don't know yet.

916
02:18:37,892 --> 02:18:41,395
Then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

917
02:18:41,563 --> 02:18:45,691
I have some extra seeds.
You might like to start your own garden.

918
02:18:54,075 --> 02:18:55,367
[LAUGHING]

919
02:19:10,175 --> 02:19:13,427
PAPILLON:
You see? It's a horseshoe.

920
02:19:13,595 --> 02:19:16,472
When the waves break,
they have no place else to go...

921
02:19:16,639 --> 02:19:18,474
...except go back out again.

922
02:19:18,641 --> 02:19:21,852
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

923
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:25,773
In fact, there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

924
02:19:25,982 --> 02:19:29,777
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw them over...

925
02:19:30,445 --> 02:19:32,613
...float out on a wave.

926
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:35,991
Then what happens?

927
02:19:36,326 --> 02:19:41,121
PAPILLON: The mainland's only 24 miles.
You just drift with the current.

928
02:19:43,291 --> 02:19:45,125
Only two days.

929
02:19:45,293 --> 02:19:47,127
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

930
02:19:49,297 --> 02:19:52,841
Seems so..... Ha, ha, so desperate.

931
02:19:53,676 --> 02:19:54,927
Yeah.

932
02:19:56,346 --> 02:19:58,639
You think it will work?

933
02:19:59,557 --> 02:20:01,433
Does it matter?

934
02:20:07,524 --> 02:20:10,484
Get. Get. Now, that's not yours.

935
02:20:10,652 --> 02:20:11,693
Now, you get away.

936
02:20:11,861 --> 02:20:15,030
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

937
02:20:15,198 --> 02:20:17,199
Freddie's not feeling well today...

938
02:20:17,367 --> 02:20:19,660
...and you should appreciate that fact.

939
02:20:20,286 --> 02:20:21,829
Here we are.

940
02:20:24,416 --> 02:20:26,792
Okay, little one. All right.

941
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:30,712
Freddie.

942
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:34,174
Freddie, that's not for you.
That's Adam's.

943
02:20:34,342 --> 02:20:36,176
Come here, Adam.

944
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:40,431
- Let's take a walk.
- Certainly.

945
02:20:40,598 --> 02:20:43,016
Isn't that a little small?

946
02:20:43,518 --> 02:20:46,937
- It's just to try it with.
- Certainly.

947
02:20:47,981 --> 02:20:52,025
You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

948
02:20:52,193 --> 02:20:55,904
There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

949
02:20:56,281 --> 02:20:59,158
Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

950
02:20:59,325 --> 02:21:02,995
- What do you think, huh?
- Come on.

951
02:23:29,517 --> 02:23:31,268
It was the wrong wave.

952
02:23:32,979 --> 02:23:35,314
Oh, yeah.

953
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:38,233
They come in a series of seven.

954
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:40,694
And the seventh wave is big enough...

955
02:23:40,862 --> 02:23:43,530
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

956
02:23:46,117 --> 02:23:48,577
- Are you certain?
- Yeah.

957
02:23:49,746 --> 02:23:51,371
Excellent.

958
02:23:56,002 --> 02:23:59,296
Oh, if we're going,
I better pick those carrots.

959
02:24:14,354 --> 02:24:16,396
Fourth wave.

960
02:24:25,615 --> 02:24:26,907
Ready?

961
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:29,826
I must tell you something.

962
02:24:29,994 --> 02:24:33,622
Louis, you don't have to say anything.

963
02:24:34,624 --> 02:24:36,625
I meant to.

964
02:24:37,752 --> 02:24:38,794
I'm sorry.

965
02:24:40,922 --> 02:24:42,047
I know.

966
02:24:46,594 --> 02:24:48,261
You'll be killed.

967
02:24:48,429 --> 02:24:49,846
You know that?

968
02:24:50,932 --> 02:24:51,932
Maybe.

969
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:54,976
Please don't do it.

970
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:43,270
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here.

971
02:27:54,991 --> 02:27:57,868
NARRATOR:
<i>Papillon made it to freedom...</i>

972
02:27:58,286 --> 02:28:03,456
<i>...and for the remaining years of his life,
he lived a free man.</i>

973
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:08,628
<i>This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...</i>

974
02:28:08,796 --> 02:28:11,089
<i>...did not survive him.</i>
