1
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,539
Quilty!

2
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:31,798
What, what?

3
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,983
Are you Quilty?

4
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:38,571
No, I'm Spartacus.

5
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,832
Have you come to free the slaves
or something?

6
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:42,352
Are you Quilty?

7
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,911
Yeah. I'm Quilty, yeah, sure.

8
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,902
Say, what you...

9
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:56,175
...what you putting your gloves on for?
Your hands cold or something?

10
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:59,066
Shall we have a little chat before we start?

11
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:00,377
Before we start?

12
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,011
All righty.

13
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:09,081
No, no, listen...

14
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:13,104
...let's have a game, a little lovely game
of Roman Ping-Pong...

15
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,744
...like two civilized senators.

16
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,038
Roman ping...

17
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,170
You're supposed to say, "Roman pong."

18
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:28,343
Okay, you serve. I don't mind.

19
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,333
I just don't mind.

20
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:31,945
Come on.

21
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,949
Bet you didn't know I had that.

22
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,283
Roman Ping-Pong.

23
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,456
Kind of tricky serve to handle, Captain?

24
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:55,442
Kind of tricky.
One of the champs taught me that.

25
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,528
My motto is: "Be prepared."

26
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,778
Say, you Jack Brewster? Are you?

27
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,405
You know who I am.

28
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:13,099
What's that? That's 3... 3-love.

29
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,862
I'm really winning,
you want to get a rally going there.

30
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:21,087
You know, I'm not accusing you, Captain,
but it's sort of absurd...

31
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:24,488
...the way people invade this house,
without even knocking.

32
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,859
4-1...

33
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:31,013
...change service. I'll take the serve again,
if you don't mind.

34
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:34,200
I sort of like to have it up this end,
you know.

35
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,445
They use the telephone.

36
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,091
What's that? That must be...

37
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:46,065
I'm really winning here. I'm really winning.

38
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,958
I hope I don't get overcome with power.

39
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,528
That's about... 6-1 maybe...

40
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,742
...let's say 6-1, no 6-2,
I'll give you another point...

41
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,843
...6- 2, but I'm still winning.

42
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,377
You really don't remember me, do you?

43
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:04,359
Did you ever notice how the champs,
different champs, use their bats?

44
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:07,819
You know, some of them hold them
like this, and everything.

45
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,538
Do you recall a girl...

46
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:13,133
...called Dolores Haze?

47
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:19,022
I remember one guy didn't have a hand.
He had a bat instead of a hand.

48
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,908
He was really sort of wacky.

49
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,118
Lolita!

50
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:25,972
Lolita...

51
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:31,022
Yeah, yeah, I remember that name all right.

52
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:34,321
Maybe she made some telephone calls,
who cares?

53
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:44,190
Hey, you're a sort of bad loser, Captain.

54
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:49,484
I never found a guy who'd sort of
pull a gun on me when he lost a game.

55
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,535
Didn't anyone ever tell you...

56
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:56,286
...it's not really who wins,
it's how you play, like the champs.

57
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:04,401
Listen, I don't think I want
to play anymore. I wanna get a drink.

58
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,135
I'm just dying for a drink.

59
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,163
I'm just dying to have a drinkie.

60
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,935
You're dying anyway, Quilty.

61
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:22,636
All my friends always put their
smokies out in the drink.

62
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:24,861
It's so unsanitary.

63
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,980
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

64
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,312
You're going to die.

65
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:32,349
Try to understand
what is happening to you.

66
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,478
You are either Australian...

67
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:39,019
...or a German refugee.

68
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:42,003
This is a gentile's house.

69
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:44,600
You'd better run along.

70
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:48,990
Think of what you did, Quilty,
and think of what is happening to you now.

71
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,424
That's a darling little gun you got there.

72
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,430
That's a darling little thing.

73
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:01,925
How much a guy like you want
for a darling little gun like that?

74
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,349
Read this.

75
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,605
What's this, the deeds of the ranch?

76
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,381
It's your death sentence.

77
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,075
Read it.

78
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,421
I can't read, mister.

79
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,388
I never did none of that there
book learning, you know.

80
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:15,666
Read it, Quilty.

81
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,381
"Because you took advantage of a sinner

82
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,527
"Because you took advantage...

83
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,113
"Because you took...

84
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:34,560
"Because you took advantage
of my disadvantage"

85
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,228
That's a dang...

86
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,022
...blasted, darn good poem you done there.

87
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,322
"When I stood Adam-naked..."

88
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,978
Adam-naked!

89
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:47,637
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Captain.

90
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,150
"Before a federal law
and all its stinging stars."

91
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,781
Tarnation! You old horn toad.

92
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,922
That's mighty pretty.
That's a pretty poem.

93
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,084
"Because you took advantage..."

94
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,387
It's getting a bit repetitious, isn't it?

95
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,942
"Because..." Here's another one:
"Because you cheated me

96
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:09,544
"Because you took her at an age...

97
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:12,244
- "...when young lads..."
- That's enough!

98
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:17,034
Say, what you took it away for, mister?
That was getting kind of smutty there.

99
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:20,092
Do you have any last words
before you die, Quilty?

100
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,014
Listen, Mac...

101
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:26,208
...you're drunk...

102
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:28,415
...and I'm a sick man.

103
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:33,011
This pistol-packing farce is becoming
a sort of nuisance.

104
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,253
Why don't you and I sort of settle this
like two civilized people...

105
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:44,296
...getting together and settling something?
Instead of... All right, put 'em up.

106
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:47,180
Do you want to die standing up
or sitting down?

107
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,255
I want to die like a champion.

108
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,459
Right in the boxing glove.

109
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:59,246
You ought to be more careful
with that thing.

110
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:04,728
Listen, Captain, why don't you stop
trifling with life and death?

111
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,825
I'm a playwright, you know.
I know all about this sort of tragedy and...

112
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:12,442
...and comedy and fantasy and everything.

113
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,731
I've got 52 successful...

114
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,418
...scenarios to my credit...

115
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:20,600
...added to which, my father's a policeman.
You look like a music lover to me.

116
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,378
Why don't you let...

117
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,227
Why don't you let me play you
a little thing I...

118
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,736
...I wrote last week.

119
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,812
Nice sort of opening there.

120
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,386
We could dream up some lyrics maybe.
You and I dream them up together...

121
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,537
...you know, share the profits.

122
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,792
Do you think that'll make the hit parade?

123
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,648
"The moon was blue, and so are you,
and I tonight...

124
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,113
"...she's mine, yours...

125
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,328
"...she's yours tonight...

126
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,190
"...and the moon is..."

127
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,773
Gee, that hurt me, that...
You really hurt me.

128
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,739
If you're trying to scare me,
you did a pretty swell job already.

129
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,195
My leg'll be black and blue tomorrow.

130
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:24,564
You know this house is roomy and cool.
You see how cool it is.

131
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:29,258
I intend on moving to England
or Florence forever.

132
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,594
You can move in.

133
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:33,840
I've got some nice friends
who could come and keep you company.

134
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,605
You could use them as pieces of furniture.

135
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:39,888
There's one guy who looks
just like a bookcase.

136
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:44,165
I could fix for you to attend executions.
How would you like that?

137
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:48,421
Just you there, and nobody else,
just watching, watch.

138
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,684
Do you like watching, Captain?

139
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:54,247
Because not many people know...

140
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,158
...that the chair is painted yellow.

141
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,709
You'd be the only guy in the know.

142
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,720
Imagine! Your friends,
you could tell them...

143
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:07,680
That hurt!

144
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,470
Having recently arrived in America...

145
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:28,848
...where so many Europeans have found
a haven before...

146
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,769
...I decided to spend a peaceful summer...

147
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,843
...in the attractive resort town
of Ramsdale, New Hampshire.

148
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,223
Some English translations I had made
of French poetry...

149
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:42,726
...had enjoyed some success
and I had been appointed...

150
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:47,549
...to a lectureship at Beardsley College,
Ohio, in the fall.

151
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,913
Friends had given me several addresses
in Ramsdale...

152
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,961
...where lodgings were available
for the summer.

153
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,378
Mr. Hofsteader said that
you're going to be staying all summer.

154
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,357
Well, that was only a tentative plan.

155
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,825
Monsieur, if what you're needing
is peace and quiet...

156
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:09,971
...I can assure you, you couldn't get
more peace anywhere.

157
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,546
Yes, it is very...

158
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,293
It's very peaceful.

159
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:16,382
Now, this would be your room.

160
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:20,911
It's what you might call a studio,
well, you know, a semi-studio affair.

161
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,891
It's very male...

162
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:24,682
...and quiet.

163
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:28,440
We're really very fortunate
here in West Ramsdale.

164
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:31,279
Culturally, we're a very advanced group...

165
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,607
...with lots of good Anglo-Dutch
and Anglo-Scotch stock...

166
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:39,338
...and we're very progressive intellectually.

167
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:40,976
That is immediately apparent.

168
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:43,772
I do hope you'll want to address our club.

169
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:46,826
There's a nice view from this window...

170
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:48,675
...of the front lawn.

171
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,013
A good place for you to do your writing...

172
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:55,389
- Shelves for your books.
- That's very nice, yes.

173
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,357
I am chairman of
the Great Books Committee.

174
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:00,693
As a matter of fact, you know...

175
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,968
...one of the speakers
that I had last season...

176
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,409
...was Clare Quilty.

177
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:07,672
Clare Quilty?

178
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,757
The writer, TV?

179
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,953
- TV plays?
- No, I wouldn't...

180
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:14,622
He's a very stimulating type of man.

181
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:18,645
He gave us a talk on Dr. Schweitzer
and Dr. Zhivago.

182
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:21,376
Schweitzer and Zhivago. Very nice.

183
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:26,707
Oh, no, the bathroom's back here,
right next door.

184
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:31,440
Well, we still have that good, old-fashioned
quaint plumbing...

185
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,873
...should appeal to a European.

186
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,582
Excuse the soiled sock.

187
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,908
I see that you're interested in art.
In that case...

188
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,582
In that case you really must see...

189
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:54,366
...the collection of reproductions
I have in my bedroom.

190
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,669
Voila!

191
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,453
Oh, yes, that's...

192
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,405
A Dufy.

193
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,553
That's very nice.

194
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:03,894
And there's my little van Gogh. Monet.

195
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,780
Is Madame Humbert...

196
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,988
There's no madame. We are divorced.

197
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,026
Happily divorced.

198
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:14,713
- When did all this happen?
- About a year ago in Paris.

199
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,582
Paris...

200
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,537
...France...

201
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,868
...Madame.

202
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:22,657
You know, monsieur, I believe
that it's only in the romance languages...

203
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:26,646
...that one is able to really relate
in a mature fashion.

204
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,452
In fact, I remember
when the late Mr. Haze and I...

205
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:32,007
Oh, the late Mr. Haze?

206
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:34,292
Yes, he's passed on.

207
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:37,996
But when we were
on our honeymoon abroad...

208
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:43,758
...I knew that I'd never felt married
until I heard myself addressed as "Senora."

209
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:45,544
You were in Spain?

210
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:46,746
No, Mexico.

211
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,147
Mexico.

212
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:52,304
There were so many places
we had planned to travel...

213
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,423
...but he was occupied with his work here.

214
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:57,165
He was in insurance...

215
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,125
...left me well-provided for.

216
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,563
He was a lovely human being...

217
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,653
...a man of complete integrity.

218
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,818
I know you would have liked to talk
to the late Mr. Haze, and he to you.

219
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,575
Yes, I'm sure I would have.

220
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,039
Those are his ashes.

221
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:20,969
How late was the...

222
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,970
...late Mr. Haze?

223
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,629
Seven years.

224
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,623
It's very difficult for a woman...

225
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,584
...an attractive woman alone, you know.

226
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,602
Yes, I'm sure it is.

227
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:40,087
Downstairs. Excuse me.

228
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:44,623
I've told Lolita ten times
to keep that in her room.

229
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:48,834
- You have a maid living in the house?
- Why, monsieur, Ramsdale is not Paris.

230
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,817
No, the colored girl comes
three times a week.

231
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:57,541
We think we're lucky to get her,
but she does do shirts very well.

232
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:01,230
Back here we have the kitchen.
That's where we have our informal meals.

233
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,681
- Perhaps...
- My pastries win prizes around here.

234
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,460
If you'll give me your number...

235
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,163
...that would give me a chance
to think it over.

236
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,597
1776.

237
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,735
1776...

238
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:16,068
...the Declaration of Independence.

239
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:17,934
Yes, so easy to remember.

240
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:21,073
You must see the garden before you go,
you must...

241
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:26,720
My flowers win prizes around here.
They're the talk of the neighborhood.

242
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:28,945
Voila!

243
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,603
My yellow roses, my...

244
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,619
My daughter.

245
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,921
Darling, turn that down please.

246
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,858
I can offer you a comfortable home...

247
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,222
...a sunny garden...

248
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,728
...a congenial atmosphere...

249
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,525
...my cherry pies.

250
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:49,146
Well...

251
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:52,750
...we haven't discussed how much...

252
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,596
Well, something nominal, let's say...

253
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:59,017
...$200 a month...
- Yes, that's very...

254
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,102
...including meals and late snacks...

255
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,616
...etcetera.

256
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:06,858
That's very reasonable. Well, it's very nice.

257
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:10,964
You couldn't find better value
in West Ramsdale.

258
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,219
No, when will it be convenient for you
to have me move in?

259
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,439
Right now. It'd be silly for you to go
to a hotel, monsieur.

260
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:23,192
Both my bags are in the taxi.
You're a very persuasive saleswoman.

261
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,712
Thank you.

262
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:29,167
What was the decisive factor? My garden?

263
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,145
I think it was your cherry pies.

264
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,907
Now, this is the one
that goes back and forth?

265
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:23,999
Yes, that can leap over the other pieces.

266
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,032
It goes round corners.

267
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,922
You're going to take my queen?

268
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,249
That was my intention, certainly.

269
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,732
Bed-y-bye, dear.

270
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,532
Goodnight.

271
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,269
Goodnight.

272
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,055
Goodnight, Lo.

273
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:56,613
Well, that wasn't very clever of you.

274
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,678
Oh, dear.

275
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:03,004
It had to happen sometime.

276
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,145
...31, 32, 33, 34...

277
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,674
See how relaxed you're getting?

278
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,018
There's Mother. Let's go say hello.

279
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:54,560
Hi, Mom.

280
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,205
Hello, darling.

281
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:57,709
Hello, Kenny.

282
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,811
Good evening, Mrs. Haze.

283
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,114
Kenny, this is Mr. Humbert.

284
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,930
- Kenny Overton.
- How do you do?

285
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:06,918
Are you having a good time?

286
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:09,816
Well, we'll see you then.

287
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:10,823
Bye-bye.

288
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:17,270
Aren't they adorable together?

289
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:22,768
I think tonight's the night.

290
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:25,863
Well, Lolita told me that she's positive...

291
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,975
...Kenny's going to ask her
to go steady tonight.

292
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,329
Hello, Charlotte.

293
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,259
Jean, John, hello.

294
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:41,769
- Hi, Humbert.
- Hi, Hum.

295
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,268
Sorry we're late. I got held up in court.

296
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,124
The prosecution brought in
some new witnesses.

297
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:51,198
I had to stay with my client
and prepare for tomorrow.

298
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:55,858
John, can't you stop being a lawyer
for just one night in the week?

299
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,305
Mind if I dance with your girl?
We could sort of swop partners.

300
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,770
You're most welcome.

301
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:05,527
Well, this is what you get
because you won't dance.

302
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,766
Hi, Humbert.

303
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,153
- I'm sorry that I don't dance.
- That's all right.

304
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:16,209
I don't like dancing either very much.
Did you know that?

305
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:20,326
It's a funny thing, Humbert, but John and I,
we first met at a dance...

306
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:25,319
...and I was sort of sitting it out,
so he just sat it out, too.

307
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,148
That's very romantic.

308
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,234
Hi, Dad.

309
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,418
Mona, baby.

310
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,689
Darling!

311
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,838
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

312
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,331
Humbert...

313
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:38,842
...don't tell Charlotte that I told you this,
will you...

314
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,267
...but did you know that you've had
the most remarkable effect on her?

315
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:45,350
- Did you know that?
- I have?

316
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,028
I know it's none of my business, but...

317
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,363
...she's begun to radiate a certain glow.

318
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:56,610
I hardly think that has anything
to do with me.

319
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:02,458
Humbert, when you get to know me better,
you'll find I'm extremely broad-minded.

320
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:09,918
In fact, John and I,
we're both broad-minded.

321
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:21,808
Hey, you two, cut that out.

322
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:25,206
I'm so thirsty.
Let's all have a little punch now.

323
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,305
That's a good idea.

324
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,103
- There aren't any clean cups anymore.
- I'll get some from another table.

325
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,905
Thank you, Humbert.

326
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:36,790
Jean, your Mona looks simply enchanting
in that cloud of pink.

327
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:40,180
She's certainly becoming
a mature young lady, isn't she?

328
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:42,015
Yes. Where does the time go?

329
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:44,976
Do you know this summer
she'll be a junior camp counselor?

330
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:46,912
No, that's simply wonderful.

331
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:49,245
Are you sending her
to that Camp Climax again?

332
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,282
Of course.

333
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,862
We've done it every summer,
since she was ten.

334
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:56,173
It gives Jean and me a chance
to catch up on our homework.

335
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,343
Excuse me, kids.

336
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,708
My feet are killing me!

337
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:45,136
Who is that?

338
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:46,271
Who?

339
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:47,826
There.

340
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:58,934
It's Clare Quilty. You know, the TV writer?

341
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,209
I adored his play,
The Lady Who Loved Lightning.

342
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:08,339
It was marvelous.

343
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:13,258
Excuse me, kids, I'm going to go over
and say hello.

344
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:28,494
Hello!

345
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,552
Hello, hello again!

346
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,678
Wow!

347
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,390
It's certainly been a long time.

348
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,331
It certainly has... yes.

349
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:55,261
Do you know I've been the local authority
on you ever since?

350
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:58,218
Is that so? That's very sweet
of you, thank you.

351
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:01,134
I'll never forget that
intellectually stimulating talk...

352
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:03,009
...that you gave to our club.

353
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:07,623
A magnificent club, really magnificent.
Tell me one thing, are you a columnist?

354
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,927
No, don't you remember?

355
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:12,563
That afternoon changed my whole life.

356
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,311
Well, how about that.

357
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,725
You remember, you...

358
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,043
What, what?

359
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,320
Did I do that? Did I?

360
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:33,227
And afterwards, you know,
I showed you my garden...

361
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,426
...and I drove you to the airport.

362
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,514
Yes!

363
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,558
Really great fun.

364
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,746
Listen, didn't you have a daughter...

365
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,249
Didn't you have a daughter
with a lovely name?

366
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:48,440
Yeah, what was it now?
A lovely, lyrical, lilting name like...

367
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:49,661
Lolita.

368
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,337
Lolita, that's right.
Lolita, diminutive of Dolores...

369
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,388
...the tears and the roses.

370
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,379
Wednesday she's going to have
a cavity filled by your Uncle lvor.

371
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:01,440
Yeah!

372
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:17,235
There you are. Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

373
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:20,678
I strolled around for a while
and then I came up here.

374
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:23,285
You poor man,
I'll bet you're bored to tears.

375
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,569
On the contrary I find it most interesting.

376
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,473
Charlotte. Hello.

377
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:30,716
Humbert, you found a place to sit down.

378
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:32,247
Oh, gosh.

379
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,780
Charlotte, Mona's having
a little get-together...

380
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,966
...later on at our house,
and she and Freddy Beale...

381
00:27:40,044 --> 00:27:43,753
...and some others, are having
a jam session, or whatever it's called.

382
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:46,751
Anyhow, she wants to know
if Lolita and Kenny can come.

383
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:50,373
I don't see why not, as long
as you have her home by midnight.

384
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:53,538
But Charlotte, tonight's a special occasion.

385
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:56,125
Why don't you have Lolita stay over
with Mona?

386
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:58,436
John can bring her back in the morning,
can't you?

387
00:27:58,462 --> 00:27:59,372
Yes, sure.

388
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:01,173
That would be too much trouble.

389
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,408
- Of course not.
- No, it's the easiest thing in the world.

390
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:07,732
It's settled.

391
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,259
I guess we'd better say goodnight
to you two kids.

392
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,928
John and I have to get home
in time to supervise things.

393
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,718
You know, what she means is
keep the lights on.

394
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:22,630
- I think we ought to come over and help.
- No, we wouldn't think of it, Humbert. No.

395
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:26,705
- It's no trouble at all, is it, Charlotte?
- Well, Jean, perhaps we should...

396
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,240
- We're not doing anything else.
- No, no.

397
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,330
No, they don't like
too many grownups around.

398
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:33,378
That's right.

399
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,688
- Goodnight, Charlotte.
- Goodnight, Jean.

400
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,590
Goodnight. See you.

401
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,545
Goodnight, Humbert.

402
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:43,835
Now, you don't want that.
It'll spoil your appetite.

403
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:48,268
We can go home now
and have a cozy little dinner for two.

404
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,571
- I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long?
- No, not at all.

405
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:02,414
I thought I'd change into something cozier.

406
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,315
Charming.

407
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:06,663
- You don't think it's... a little too risque?
- No, not at all.

408
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,145
Charlotte, this may not be
the right time or place...

409
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,356
Not another word until we've finished
our pink champagne.

410
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:21,324
In a sense, this is none of my business,
but I've come to feel almost...

411
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:24,463
...like a member of the family
where Lolita is concerned.

412
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,498
Yes, I know, and I appreciate it.

413
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,657
I've come to feel as if
you're a member of the family too.

414
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,433
I wonder if you aren't being
too liberal with her?

415
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,631
Liberal?

416
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:36,569
Oh, you dear man...

417
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:39,478
...you dear, sweet, naive man.

418
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:42,600
No, I don't think you realize
that she's beginning to grow up.

419
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:45,193
Of course she's beginning to grow up...

420
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:48,800
...and it's only natural and healthy...

421
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:52,848
...that she should take an interest
in those fascinating creatures...

422
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,439
...known as: "the opposite sex."

423
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,195
Cheerio. But should she be allowed
to stay out all night?

424
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,787
She's not staying out.

425
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,211
She's at Jean and John's.

426
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:08,400
Yes, but something about them
that makes me wonder...

427
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:11,761
...whether they would provide
the right kind of supervision.

428
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:16,823
Hum, you're so charmingly Old World...

429
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:20,538
...but then, that's what I adore about you.

430
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:23,730
I have a proposal.

431
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:27,905
What say you I teach you
some of the new steps?

432
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:30,898
No, Charlotte.
I don't even know the old ones.

433
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:34,841
And you do this so very well
I'd much rather sit down and watch you.

434
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:37,283
You're very good.

435
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:39,640
Come on, Humbert.

436
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:43,875
Humbert Humbert,
what a thrillingly different name.

437
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:49,455
Do you pronounce the surname differently,
you know, in a slightly lower tone?

438
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,298
Let me see now, Humbert.

439
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:55,263
What was that, the first or the second?

440
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:59,524
Seriously, I'm an awkward tripper
and I have no sense of rhythm.

441
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:02,652
I refuse to believe that about you.

442
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:06,679
Rhythm is so basic...

443
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:10,936
...and it just pours out of you,
you simply vibrate rhythm.

444
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:18,967
- I'll clap my hands and you go on dancing.
- Now, come on, Humbert...

445
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,299
...and that was not your surname.

446
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,535
Now, put your hands here...

447
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,550
...tighter.

448
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,822
All right, ready, go.

449
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,238
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

450
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,426
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

451
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,595
Very good.

452
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,798
A little more joie de vivre.

453
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:47,003
You know, when you smile like that
you remind me of someone...

454
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:52,538
A college boy I had a date with.

455
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:56,456
I went dancing with him,
a young blue-blooded Bostonian.

456
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,663
My very first glamour date.

457
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:01,924
And, you know...

458
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,884
...in certain lights you remind me of Harold.

459
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:07,459
You mean, the late Mr...

460
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:08,793
Yes.

461
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,930
You're really very different, of course.

462
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:13,972
Yes, I imagine I am.

463
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:17,688
But, you know, I adored Harold.

464
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,814
I really did. I swore at the time
I would never marry again.

465
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,929
I don't think I will, but...

466
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,701
...it wouldn't be fair to his memory,
do you think?

467
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:29,939
No, one doesn't often find
such loyalty these days.

468
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,583
But sometimes, Hum, I wonder...

469
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:35,828
...shouldn't life be for the living?

470
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:37,578
What think you?

471
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,499
You see, I'm a strongly emotional woman...

472
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:43,094
...very strongly emotional.

473
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:47,121
- Don't be afraid of hurting me.
- No, I'm not, really.

474
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,881
Take me in your arms.

475
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:53,004
I can't live in the past.
Not anymore, Hum, not anymore.

476
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,126
Hi!

477
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,975
Lolita!

478
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,058
Darling...

479
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,652
Cha-cha-cha.

480
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:09,740
Did you come back for something?

481
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,871
No, Mona's party turned out
to be sort of a drag.

482
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:15,845
I thought I'd come back
and see what you were doing.

483
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:19,919
We had a wonderful evening.
Your mother created a magnificent spread.

484
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,680
Did you have something to eat?

485
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:25,054
They served some kind of salty fish eggs,
but I didn't like 'em.

486
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:28,172
I'll make you a sandwich.
There's lots of food left over.

487
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:30,094
That's great. I'm starving.

488
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:33,815
I don't think she should be stuffing herself
when she should go to sleep.

489
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:34,913
But, Mom...

490
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:38,936
...l'm hungry and I've got to have
something to eat.

491
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:40,986
All right...

492
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:45,284
...but you take it upstairs
and after you've eaten it...

493
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,570
...you go right to sleep.

494
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:52,227
Did you have a good time
dancing with Clare Quilty?

495
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,861
Well, of course...

496
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,167
...he's a very erudite gentleman.

497
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:59,750
Yeah, I know.
All the girls are crazy about him, too.

498
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:02,053
That's neither here nor there.

499
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,049
Since when?

500
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:06,688
Here we are, excuse me...

501
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:09,955
...loaded with mayonnaise,
just the way you like it.

502
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,095
Thank you.

503
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,805
Darling, take it upstairs.

504
00:34:15,105 --> 00:34:17,903
I don't want to go to bed. It's too early.

505
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:21,695
We all think that Lo should go to bed.

506
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,557
I don't have to. This is a free country.

507
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:28,633
Which means there will be
no allowance this week.

508
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:30,622
Which means I think you stink this week.

509
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,518
To bed this instant!

510
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:33,717
Go to bed.

511
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,177
I heard that.

512
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,136
Goodnight, Lo.

513
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,657
That miserable little brat.

514
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:49,720
She is becoming impossible,
simply impossible.

515
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:53,616
The idea of her sneaking back here
and spying on us.

516
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,329
I don't think she was spying on us.

517
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,117
Really? What would you call it?

518
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,752
I'm sure she intended no harm.

519
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:02,993
Like hell she didn't!
She's always been a spiteful, little pest.

520
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:06,058
Since the age of one, you know,
she kept throwing her toys...

521
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:10,162
...out of her crib so that I would have
to keep stooping over to pick them up.

522
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:12,746
She has always had some kind
of gripe against me.

523
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,608
Now she sees herself
as some kind of a starlet.

524
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,627
Well, I see her as a sturdy,
healthy but decidedly homely child.

525
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:23,834
I mean, is it my fault if I feel young?

526
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,105
Why should my child resent it?
You don't resent it, do you?

527
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:30,931
Do you think I'm just a foolish,
romantic American girl?

528
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,034
No... no.

529
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:46,174
Why don't I throw on a wrap and we can
go out for a little ride in the car?

530
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,552
Well, it's a little late, Charlotte.

531
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:53,003
Well, let's at least finish
our champagne, shall we?

532
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:56,632
I've had a very exhausting evening.
I think I'd best go to bed.

533
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,631
But it's not even 1:00.

534
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:03,816
My neuralgia's about to strike
with heartburn, an old ally, and so...

535
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:07,765
Goodnight, and thank you
for a charming evening.

536
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:11,277
You're very welcome.

537
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:49,292
What drives me insane is
the twofold nature of this nymphet...

538
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,716
...of every nymphet, perhaps.

539
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:55,985
This mixture in my Lolita of tender,
dreamy childishness...

540
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,725
...and a kind of eerie vulgarity.

541
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:04,930
I know it is madness to keep this journal,
but it gives me a strange thrill to do so...

542
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:08,963
...and only a loving wife could decipher
my microscopic script.

543
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,739
In this house, we do not eat
with the table on the elbows...

544
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,377
...elbows on the tables.

545
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:27,518
Must you pamper your pimples?

546
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:32,009
Do you mind if I eat?
I've got to meet Mona.

547
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,625
This morning you have to meet Mona!
Last night...

548
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:38,746
First you wash every dish,
then you go upstairs...

549
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,779
...and make your bed
and clean up your room.

550
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,837
I am not picking up after you today, miss,
or any day!

551
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,056
Hello. Excuse me.

552
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,204
- Is it Kenny?
- No. Just a minute.

553
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:01,312
Jean, just a second.

554
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:06,030
Take this tray up to Professor Humbert
and do not disturb him.

555
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:08,152
Yes, ma'am!

556
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:09,729
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,309
Jean?

558
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,991
I'm very glad you called.

559
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,400
Yes.

560
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:18,770
Mona?

561
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,052
What time?

562
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,858
Well, I'm very glad you called me, Jean.

563
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:28,516
Well, there's something very important
we both have to talk about.

564
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:31,557
That's a good idea. Well, I'd rather not...

565
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,011
Who is it?

566
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:33,898
Lolita.

567
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,718
Come in.

568
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,729
Here's your breakfast.

569
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:43,536
Thank you very much. Good morning!

570
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,073
Good morning.

571
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:51,178
Don't tell Mom, but I ate all your bacon.

572
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:54,458
You have a very long face today.

573
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:56,134
Oh, yeah?

574
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,194
What were you writing?

575
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,034
I was writing a poem.

576
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,752
What's it about?

577
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,439
It's about people.

578
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,182
That's a novel subject.

579
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:20,820
You know, it's funny, it sort of looked
like a diary when I came in.

580
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:26,244
I always write my poems in a diary.
It's one of my little idiosyncrasies.

581
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:33,391
Afraid somebody's going to steal
your ideas and sell them to Hollywood?

582
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,000
Perhaps. Would you like me
to read you some poetry?

583
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:39,132
Sure, why not?

584
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,482
This is my favorite poet.

585
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:46,425
- "It was..."
- Who's the poet?

586
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,328
The divine Edgar.

587
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:50,582
Who's the divine Edgar. Edgar who?

588
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:52,737
Edgar Allan Poe, of course.

589
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:55,093
"It was night in the lonesome October

590
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:58,142
"Of my most immemorial year"

591
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,034
Notice how he emphasizes this word.

592
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:04,003
"It was hard by the dim lake of Auber

593
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:06,945
"In the misty mid region of Weir"

594
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,565
You see, he takes a word like "dim"
in one line and twists it?

595
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,558
And it comes back as "mid region of Weir."

596
00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:17,376
"Mid region," and twists it to "dim."

597
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,881
That's pretty good, pretty clever.

598
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:23,495
"Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her

599
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,432
"And conquered her scruples and gloom

600
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,345
"And we passed to the end of the vista

601
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:32,065
"But were stopped by the door of a tomb

602
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,654
"And I said, 'What is written, sweet sister? '

603
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:38,639
"She replied, 'Ulalume, Ulalume."'

604
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,107
Well, I think it's a little corny,
to tell you the truth.

605
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:45,242
What do you object to?

606
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:49,444
Well, the "vista-sister," that's like,
"Lolita-sweeter."

607
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,393
That's very true.
That's a very acute observation.

608
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,839
If you were in my class
I would give you an A plus.

609
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:01,558
Tell me, was Mona Farlow annoyed
when you left her party last night?

610
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,884
Mona? Annoyed?

611
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:08,346
Well, I thought she might be
looking forward to...

612
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,591
Don't worry about Mona.

613
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:15,473
- Let me tell you something about Mona.
- Do, please.

614
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:20,119
No, I'd better not tell you. You'll blab.

615
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:23,435
I will never give away any of your secrets.

616
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,551
- You wouldn't?
- I promise.

617
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:31,414
Well, for that you get a little reward.

618
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:33,364
Thank you very much.

619
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,646
- Here!
- Oh, no, please. No.

620
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:38,304
Lolita. No.

621
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,361
Put your head back.

622
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,222
Put your head back.

623
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,338
Open your mouth.

624
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,739
You can have one little bite.

625
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:51,316
Lolita?

626
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:56,147
Lolita!

627
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:57,782
What?

628
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,448
Come down here.

629
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,326
What do you want?

630
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,945
Firstly...

631
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:11,567
...when I call you I want you
to come right down...

632
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:14,573
...and not make me holler for you
from room to room.

633
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:15,940
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:19,455
Secondly, I want you to go
right into your room and put on a dress.

635
00:42:19,422 --> 00:42:22,175
I'm going to the Farlows
and I want you to come.

636
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,195
But I'm supposed to meet Mona
at the lake.

637
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,014
And lastly, I forbid you
to disturb Professor Humbert again.

638
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:30,692
He is a writer and he is not
to be disturbed.

639
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:32,562
Sieg heil.

640
00:42:37,574 --> 00:42:40,213
I have a glorious surprise for us.

641
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,094
One of your dramatic sweets?

642
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:46,027
Guess again.

643
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,610
The Farlows have been arrested.

644
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:54,721
Really, Hum. Thank you, Louise.

645
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:57,241
I'm no good at guessing.

646
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:01,465
Mona Farlow is leaving
for summer camp tomorrow.

647
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,156
Lolita is going with her.

648
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,290
You were absolutely right
when you warned me...

649
00:43:07,303 --> 00:43:10,261
...that I was getting too liberal
with her about boys.

650
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,212
What's more, Mona disappeared
from that party last night...

651
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:15,703
...and she did not come home till 4:00 a.m.

652
00:43:16,146 --> 00:43:19,422
So Jean and I decided
that isolation from boys...

653
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:23,441
...would be the best thing
for both of the girls this crucial summer.

654
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:29,725
Do you think that the camp is the answer?

655
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:32,798
Frankly, Hum, I do. It's all arranged.

656
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:36,193
The Farlows and I phoned
the camp long-distance...

657
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,991
...and I did all the shopping this...

658
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,549
Is something the matter with your face?

659
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:42,640
Toothache.

660
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,325
You poor man.

661
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:48,572
If it still pains you tomorrow,
I'll call and arrange an appointment.

662
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:51,135
How far away is this camp?

663
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:55,420
Two hundred miles.
It was a stroke of genius on Mama's part.

664
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:58,461
Ain't I clever?

665
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:04,349
Shall we take our coffee out to the piazza...

666
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:08,111
...or do you want to go upstairs
and nurse that tooth?

667
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,615
Nurse the tooth.

668
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,879
I'll be right back.

669
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:06,255
I guess I won't be seeing you again.

670
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,342
I shall be moving on.

671
00:45:09,726 --> 00:45:13,196
I must prepare for my work
at Beardsley College in the fall.

672
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,800
Then I guess this is goodbye.

673
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:19,437
Yes.

674
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:22,455
Don't forget me.

675
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,320
Are you upstairs, Mr. Humbert?

676
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:32,556
Mr. Humbert!

677
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,492
Mrs. Haze asked me to give you this.

678
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:45,871
Thank you very much.

679
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:01,647
"This is a confession.

680
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:04,192
"I love you.

681
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:09,321
"Last Sunday in church, my dear one,
when I asked the Lord...

682
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:13,477
"...what to do about it,
I was told to act as I am acting now.

683
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:16,800
"You see, there is no alternative.

684
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,959
"I have loved you from the minute
I saw you.

685
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:24,595
"I am a passionate and lonely woman...

686
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,456
"...and you are the love of my life.

687
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:29,569
"Now you know.

688
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:33,031
"So you will please, at once,
pack and leave.

689
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:37,445
"This is a landlady's order.
I am dismissing a lodger.

690
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:41,469
"I am kicking you out.
Go, scram, departez!

691
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:46,371
"I shall be back by dinnertime.
I do not wish to find you in the house.

692
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,796
"You see, cherie...

693
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,736
"...if you decided to stay,
if I found you at home...

694
00:47:52,588 --> 00:47:54,738
"...which I know I won't...

695
00:47:54,924 --> 00:47:58,883
"...and that's why I'm able
to go on like this...

696
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:03,468
"...the fact of your remaining
would only mean one thing: That you...

697
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:10,440
"...that you want me as much as I do you...

698
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,518
"...as a lifelong mate...

699
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:20,398
"...and you are ready to link up your life
with mine forever and ever...

700
00:48:20,283 --> 00:48:22,592
"...and be a father to my little girl.

701
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:24,850
"Goodbye, dear one.

702
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:27,365
"Pray for me...

703
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:30,722
"...if you ever pray."

704
00:49:01,591 --> 00:49:02,580
Hum?

705
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:13,991
Hum, baby.

706
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:18,477
The wedding was a quiet affair...

707
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:22,885
...and when called upon to enjoy
my promotion from lodger to lover...

708
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:26,063
...did I experience only bitterness
and distaste?

709
00:49:26,816 --> 00:49:31,765
No, Mr. Humbert confesses
to a certain titillation of his vanity...

710
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:36,653
...to some faint tenderness,
even to a pattern of remorse...

711
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:40,480
...daintily running along the steel
of his conspiratorial dagger.

712
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,486
Dear, the door's locked.

713
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,248
Sweetheart, I don't want
any secrets between us.

714
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:52,968
It makes me feel insecure.

715
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,671
Can't this wait till I come out of here?

716
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:02,816
I suppose...

717
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:11,100
Hum, what do you do in there so long?

718
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:13,630
I want to talk to you.

719
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:19,171
I haven't been here long.
In point of fact, I only just came in.

720
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:24,157
Were there a lot of women
in your life before me?

721
00:50:24,674 --> 00:50:26,949
I've told you about them already.

722
00:50:28,644 --> 00:50:30,635
Well, you didn't tell me...

723
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:33,532
...about all of them.

724
00:50:34,884 --> 00:50:37,717
Charlotte, if it would make you
any happier...

725
00:50:37,653 --> 00:50:40,213
...I will sit right down and make out
a complete list...

726
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:42,665
...of every woman I have ever known.

727
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:44,702
Would that satisfy you?

728
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:47,634
I'm lonesome.

729
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:55,655
I think it's healthy for me to be jealous.

730
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,163
It means that I love you.

731
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:05,585
You know how happy I can make you.

732
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:13,070
But...

733
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:17,929
...Charlotte, I haven't even had
my morning cup of coffee yet.

734
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:23,586
You want me to make you some?

735
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:26,134
Please do that, like a good little wife.

736
00:51:29,472 --> 00:51:30,666
All right.

737
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,059
Darling...

738
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,000
I don't care about any other woman.

739
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:59,774
I know that our love is sacred,
the others were profane.

740
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:03,222
Yes, "sacred," that's right, that's what it is.

741
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,708
Hum, baby, you know,
I love the way you smell.

742
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,703
You do arouse the pagan in me.

743
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:17,008
Hum, you just touch me
and I go as limp as a noodle.

744
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:18,668
It scares me.

745
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:20,632
Yes, I know the feeling.

746
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:25,842
Do you believe in God?

747
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:32,200
The question is: Does God believe in me?

748
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:40,156
I wouldn't care if your maternal
grandfather turned out to be a Turk.

749
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:44,000
But if I ever found out...

750
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:47,209
...that you didn't believe in God...

751
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,735
...I think I would commit suicide.

752
00:52:53,489 --> 00:52:54,638
A gun!

753
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:57,636
It belonged to Mr. Haze.

754
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,596
You should be careful with those things.

755
00:52:59,662 --> 00:53:00,981
It's not loaded.

756
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:04,180
That's what they all say,
"I didn't know it was loaded."

757
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:06,144
This is a sacred weapon.

758
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:09,000
It's a tragic treasure.

759
00:53:10,172 --> 00:53:13,960
Mr. Haze purchased it
when he found out he was ill.

760
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,247
He wanted to spare me
the sight of his suffering.

761
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:21,396
Happily or unhappily,
he was hospitalized before he could use it.

762
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:24,167
Will you put it down, please?

763
00:53:25,554 --> 00:53:26,589
Thank you.

764
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,726
That's better now, isn't it?

765
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,852
Oh, you man!

766
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:43,740
Darling...

767
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,825
...you know...

768
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,882
...I have a most ambitious fantasy.

769
00:53:50,946 --> 00:53:52,299
What's yours?

770
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:59,244
I would love to get hold of
a real French servant girl...

771
00:54:00,056 --> 00:54:03,366
...you know, like the German girls
the Farlows had...

772
00:54:05,194 --> 00:54:07,913
...and have her come and live in the house.

773
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:09,246
No room.

774
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,449
We could put her in Lo's room.

775
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:16,350
I've been meaning to make a guest room
out of that hole, anyway.

776
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:18,285
And where, pray...

777
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,611
...will you put your daughter...

778
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:24,006
...when you get your guest or your maid?

779
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:28,164
You know, I've decided
to send her straight from camp...

780
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,742
...to a good boarding school...

781
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:33,295
...with strict religious training...

782
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:35,845
...and then on to college.

783
00:54:37,326 --> 00:54:41,035
Darling, it's going to be you
and me alone...

784
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:43,343
...forever now.

785
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:55,266
Darling, you've gone away.

786
00:54:56,345 --> 00:54:59,735
Just a minute, darling,
I'm following a train of thought.

787
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,731
It doesn't matter.

788
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:20,142
C'est la vie.

789
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,318
Am I on that train?

790
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:29,860
Yes.

791
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:33,394
I should hope so.

792
00:55:37,653 --> 00:55:39,291
Let's let it ring.

793
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:49,046
Hello?

794
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,050
Yes, this is Mrs. Charlotte Humbert.

795
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:59,956
I'll accept the charges. It's Lolita.
She's calling long-distance.

796
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:01,865
Hello?

797
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:04,277
Hello, dear.

798
00:56:04,713 --> 00:56:06,112
We're fine.

799
00:56:09,018 --> 00:56:10,087
Yes.

800
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:15,379
We spent the honeymoon
on Hourglass Lake.

801
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:18,247
Well, with a few other young marrieds.

802
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:20,500
Is anything wrong?

803
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,955
You lost your new sweater?

804
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:27,430
In the woods?

805
00:56:31,073 --> 00:56:32,586
Yes, he's here.

806
00:56:34,243 --> 00:56:36,393
What do you want to thank him for?

807
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:38,962
Candy!

808
00:56:40,115 --> 00:56:41,434
Just a minute.

809
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:46,900
Hum, I really wish that you would not
send her candy without consulting me.

810
00:56:50,426 --> 00:56:52,257
I'm talking to you!

811
00:56:55,464 --> 00:56:58,979
Even in the most harmonious households
such as ours...

812
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:02,338
...not all the decisions are taken
by the female...

813
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:06,250
...especially when the male partner
has fulfilled his obligations...

814
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:08,431
...beyond the line of duty.

815
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:12,026
When you wanted me to spend
my afternoons sunbathing by the lake...

816
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:14,653
...I was glad to become
the bronzed glamour boy for you...

817
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:16,978
...instead of remaining the scholar.

818
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:21,535
Even then I scoot along after you like
an obliging little lapdog.

819
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:25,578
Yes, I'm happy. I'm delighted
to be bossed by you, but...

820
00:57:25,828 --> 00:57:27,705
...every game has its rules.

821
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:38,041
Lolita?

822
00:58:40,469 --> 00:58:43,461
No man can bring about
the perfect murder.

823
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,376
Chance, however, can do it.

824
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,071
Just minutes ago she had said
it wasn't loaded.

825
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:56,407
What if I had playfully pulled
the trigger then?

826
00:58:59,488 --> 00:59:03,322
"She said it wasn't loaded.
It belonged to the late Mr. Haze.

827
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:05,528
"She was having her morning tub.

828
00:59:05,928 --> 00:59:09,318
"We had just finished talking
about our plans for the future.

829
00:59:10,232 --> 00:59:14,066
"I decided to play a practical joke
and pretend I was a burglar.

830
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:18,229
"We were newlyweds and still did things
like that to each other.

831
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:24,269
"As soon as it happened I called
an ambulance, but it was too late."

832
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:27,479
Simple, isn't it?

833
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,336
The perfect murder!

834
01:00:15,497 --> 01:00:19,649
She splashed in the tub,
a trustful, clumsy seal...

835
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:24,423
...and all the logic of passion
screamed in my ear. ;

836
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:27,266
"Now is the time."

837
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:31,544
But, what do you know, folks...

838
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,513
...I just couldn't make myself do it.

839
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:38,373
The scream grew more and more remote...

840
01:00:38,987 --> 01:00:43,060
...and I realized the melancholy fact
that neither tomorrow nor Friday...

841
01:00:43,325 --> 01:00:45,680
...nor any other day or night...

842
01:00:46,261 --> 01:00:49,219
...could I make myself put her to death.

843
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:01,624
Charlotte?

844
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:18,295
Darling?

845
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:28,396
That's my diary. We don't read
other people's diaries, do we?

846
01:01:29,071 --> 01:01:31,869
Charlotte, that's my diary.
Give it to me, please.

847
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:35,592
Please. No, no.

848
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,282
"The Haze woman..."

849
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:40,467
"...the cow..."

850
01:01:42,184 --> 01:01:44,220
"...the obnoxious mama..."

851
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:46,456
"...the brainless baba..."

852
01:01:47,222 --> 01:01:50,259
The stupid Haze is no longer your dupe.

853
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,194
Give me that, please.

854
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,332
You leave that alone
or I'll scream out the window!

855
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:56,902
Let's discuss this.
Let's sit and discuss it quietly...

856
01:01:57,032 --> 01:01:59,387
...like civilized people.
- You're a monster!

857
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:04,350
You're a disgusting, despicable,
loathsome, criminal fraud!

858
01:02:04,306 --> 01:02:05,785
Don't do that.

859
01:02:06,842 --> 01:02:09,231
- Can we discuss...
- Get out of my way!

860
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:11,360
- Get out of my way!
- No. I want to talk...

861
01:02:11,413 --> 01:02:13,563
Go on, get out of my way.

862
01:02:15,384 --> 01:02:17,261
I'm leaving here today.

863
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:19,911
You can have all of it.

864
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:24,128
But you are never going to see
that miserable brat again!

865
01:02:24,726 --> 01:02:27,160
Charlotte, please, listen to me.

866
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:29,312
Charlotte, come here, please.

867
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:32,836
Charlotte, open the door!

868
01:02:32,734 --> 01:02:34,611
I want to speak to you.

869
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,726
It's very easy to explain.

870
01:02:36,872 --> 01:02:40,228
You have hallucinations.
You're crazy, Charlotte.

871
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:45,244
I'll get you a drink. That's what you want,
a nice little drink.

872
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,841
Harold, look what happened.

873
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:53,584
I was disloyal to you.

874
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:56,614
I couldn't help it, though.

875
01:02:56,725 --> 01:02:58,761
Seven years is a very long time.

876
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:03,597
Why did you go and die on me?

877
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:09,318
I didn't know anything about life,
I was very young.

878
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:13,723
If you hadn't died,
all this wouldn't have happened.

879
01:03:17,512 --> 01:03:19,264
Darling, forgive me.

880
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:21,623
Forgive me.

881
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,728
You were the soul of integrity.

882
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:39,603
How did we produce such a little beast?

883
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:45,655
I promise, I promise...

884
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:50,440
I promise you that
I'll know better next time.

885
01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:56,186
Next time it's going to be somebody
you'll be very proud of.

886
01:03:56,485 --> 01:03:57,554
Harold.

887
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:12,403
Those notes you found were fragments
of a novel that I'm writing.

888
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:22,290
Your name, and Lolita's,
were put in by mere chance...

889
01:04:22,244 --> 01:04:24,917
...just because they were handy.

890
01:04:30,352 --> 01:04:32,343
That's the way novelists work.

891
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,576
They think of the names of their friends...

892
01:04:35,624 --> 01:04:40,334
...and the people who enter
into their daily lives...

893
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:42,593
...like the Farlows...

894
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:46,497
...and they think up funny situations.

895
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,920
I'm making a martini for you.

896
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,003
Charlotte!

897
01:05:03,285 --> 01:05:04,638
I'll take it!

898
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:08,478
Yes?

899
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:10,595
Yes, this is he.

900
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:12,328
Yes.

901
01:05:14,262 --> 01:05:15,251
What?

902
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:20,021
But my wife is upstairs in her bedroom.

903
01:05:20,602 --> 01:05:24,117
Is this a gag? Is this one of the fellows
at the country club?

904
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:26,097
Just hold on, please.

905
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:28,049
Charlotte!

906
01:05:28,477 --> 01:05:32,026
There's a man on the line
who says that you've been hit by a car!

907
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,130
Now, listen, please, my friend.

908
01:05:34,016 --> 01:05:35,972
Just hold on one moment.

909
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:02,527
The ambulance is here.

910
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:05,482
Now, you take it easy, okay?

911
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,495
All right?

912
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:10,488
Mr. Humbert, she just ran
right in front of me!

913
01:06:10,685 --> 01:06:13,961
I swerved around, you see,
to avoid hitting the dog, and...

914
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:16,524
...she just ran right in front of me.

915
01:06:16,525 --> 01:06:19,085
My dad's in a state of shock,
I gotta look after him...

916
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:22,064
...but I just wanted you to know
it isn't my fault.

917
01:06:22,664 --> 01:06:24,734
Are you the lady's husband?

918
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:26,950
Yes.

919
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:29,127
I'm afraid she's dead.

920
01:06:45,854 --> 01:06:47,048
Humbert?

921
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:52,556
It's Jean and John.

922
01:06:59,968 --> 01:07:02,038
Humbert, where are you?

923
01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:08,884
It's all right. Come in, both of you.

924
01:07:09,377 --> 01:07:12,574
- Jean, I'm perfectly decent.
- Are you sure it's all right?

925
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:14,478
Look, there's a stool.

926
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:18,610
You poor man.

927
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,611
Just have to hang on.

928
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,528
She was a wonderful person.

929
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:30,046
She was always so gay, wasn't she, John?

930
01:07:30,098 --> 01:07:33,852
Just remember, I mean,
it's always darkest before the dawn.

931
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:36,508
That's very, very true.

932
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:41,178
It's just wonderful to have friends
at a time like this.

933
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,082
I'm so, so sorry.

934
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,792
Now, see here, old man...

935
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:53,049
...you mustn't think of doing anything rash.

936
01:07:53,088 --> 01:07:54,919
Why, of course not.

937
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,145
You have everything to live for, hasn't he?

938
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:01,516
Perhaps you'd better tell him
about Charlotte's kidney.

939
01:08:02,864 --> 01:08:06,652
Humbert, Charlotte didn't want
anybody to know this, but...

940
01:08:07,002 --> 01:08:08,913
...she hadn't long to live, anyhow.

941
01:08:08,803 --> 01:08:10,759
She only had one kidney.

942
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:12,630
- Born that way.
- Yes, that's right.

943
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:16,090
And the one kidney she had
was distressed.

944
01:08:16,411 --> 01:08:17,400
She had...

945
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:19,231
- Nephritis.
...nephritis.

946
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:24,245
I'll get it.

947
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:30,036
Try to think of your poor little Lolita
all alone in the world.

948
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:32,095
You must live for her sake.

949
01:08:35,197 --> 01:08:38,109
- Excuse me.
- That's all right. Come in, please.

950
01:08:38,033 --> 01:08:41,070
I'm Frederick Beale Senior.
May I talk to you for a moment?

951
01:08:41,136 --> 01:08:42,285
Do, please.

952
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,240
My son was driving the car.

953
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:45,731
When that thing happened.

954
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:46,696
Yes.

955
01:08:47,008 --> 01:08:51,160
My two youngest, Jack and Mary,
are in the same grade as your Lolita.

956
01:08:51,012 --> 01:08:52,923
He's had a terrible shock.

957
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,724
Yes, of course he has.

958
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:58,222
You know, this isn't easy
to talk about, but...

959
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,229
...technically it was the pedestrian's fault
and not the driver's.

960
01:09:02,524 --> 01:09:04,833
Technically, you're absolutely right.

961
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,851
You see, it was raining
and she ran across the road.

962
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:12,047
You don't have to explain to me
because I have no quarrel with you.

963
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:16,772
I must say you're wonderfully sympathetic.

964
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:19,863
In fact, you've been so generous
about the whole matter...

965
01:09:19,774 --> 01:09:22,811
...I was about to suggest that
maybe you'd allow me to pay...

966
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:24,276
...the funeral expenses.

967
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,588
That's awfully nice of you.

968
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:29,062
Thank you very much.

969
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:32,766
Well, that's the least I can do.

970
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:35,275
It's my pleasure.

971
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,885
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

972
01:09:38,059 --> 01:09:41,654
We'll have to get together very soon
and sort out the details.

973
01:09:41,596 --> 01:09:43,587
Yes, let's do that... yes.

974
01:10:29,944 --> 01:10:31,343
Do you work here?

975
01:10:31,346 --> 01:10:32,938
Yeah, sort of.

976
01:10:33,748 --> 01:10:36,216
- I didn't think you were a camper.
- No.

977
01:10:37,552 --> 01:10:40,191
This is a girls' camp exclusively, isn't it?

978
01:10:40,155 --> 01:10:41,270
Yeah, yeah.

979
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:43,272
I'm Charlie, Mrs. Sedgwick's son.

980
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,899
You visit the place, I suppose,
from time to time?

981
01:10:47,862 --> 01:10:49,261
No, I live here.

982
01:10:50,332 --> 01:10:54,166
Are you the only boy living in the camp?

983
01:10:54,336 --> 01:10:55,894
The only one.

984
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,790
Do you know a girl called Lolita?

985
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:02,642
Dolores Haze?

986
01:11:02,644 --> 01:11:04,521
Yeah, yeah, I know her.

987
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:05,484
Well?

988
01:11:05,613 --> 01:11:08,366
Well, I see her around once in a while.
Hi, Mom!

989
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:12,104
What are those sheets doing here?
You know they belong in the laundry room.

990
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:15,329
She's almost packed, Dr. Humbert.
We haven't told her anything.

991
01:11:15,357 --> 01:11:17,917
- Thank you.
- Poor man... terrible thing!

992
01:11:18,827 --> 01:11:22,820
Okay, what's the big mystery bit?
Why did those girls look at me so funny?

993
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:23,846
There's no mystery.

994
01:11:23,898 --> 01:11:27,891
It's just that I didn't want to talk
in front of your friends at the camp.

995
01:11:28,336 --> 01:11:30,133
It's your mother.

996
01:11:31,673 --> 01:11:35,427
Really? She giving me time off
for good behavior or something?

997
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:38,282
No, she hasn't been feeling very well.

998
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,271
What's the matter with her?

999
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,919
She's sick.

1000
01:11:43,017 --> 01:11:46,009
- Really, what is it?
- The doctors don't seem to know...

1001
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,751
...quite what the trouble is.

1002
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:51,159
She's been moved to a hospital
in the country near Lepingsville.

1003
01:11:51,226 --> 01:11:55,265
A hospital! Well, is that where
we're going now, this Lepingsville?

1004
01:11:55,663 --> 01:11:57,494
Yes, eventually...

1005
01:11:57,732 --> 01:12:00,451
...and then, you and I will have
to bide our time...

1006
01:12:00,402 --> 01:12:02,438
...until your mother gets well.

1007
01:12:02,737 --> 01:12:05,729
After that, I thought we might go
to the mountains for a while.

1008
01:12:05,807 --> 01:12:07,525
Does that appeal to you?

1009
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:11,319
What's the routine,
are we going home now?

1010
01:12:11,346 --> 01:12:15,419
No, dear. We shall be in Briceland
by dinnertime and I've no doubt that...

1011
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:19,404
...we shall find some comfortable hotel
to spend the night...

1012
01:12:19,354 --> 01:12:23,267
...and then tomorrow morning
we'll press on towards Lepingsville.

1013
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:29,037
Did you have a marvelous summer?

1014
01:12:30,398 --> 01:12:31,990
Yeah, I guess so.

1015
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:33,943
Were you sorry to leave?

1016
01:12:34,002 --> 01:12:35,321
Not exactly.

1017
01:12:47,081 --> 01:12:49,231
You know, I've missed you terribly.

1018
01:12:50,418 --> 01:12:54,536
I haven't missed you. In fact,
I've been revoltingly unfaithful to you.

1019
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:59,111
But it doesn't matter a bit,
because you've stopped caring anyway.

1020
01:12:59,928 --> 01:13:02,601
What makes you say
I've stopped caring for you?

1021
01:13:03,898 --> 01:13:06,093
You haven't even kissed me yet, have you?

1022
01:13:18,746 --> 01:13:20,099
Hello, Mr. Swine.

1023
01:13:20,114 --> 01:13:24,266
Hello, Mr. Quilty. Good evening, ma'am.
Did you get any good pictures today?

1024
01:13:24,152 --> 01:13:26,541
Yeah, great. I'm having a swell vacation.

1025
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:27,870
Good.

1026
01:13:27,956 --> 01:13:31,107
Mr. Swine, would you mind
if I asked you a personal question?

1027
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:32,604
Sure, go ahead.

1028
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:36,098
What is a guy like you
doing in a job like this?

1029
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:38,115
What do you mean?

1030
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:41,203
Well, you just don't seem to be the type.

1031
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:45,342
Well, as a matter of fact, I was an actor.

1032
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,310
I knew it. Didn't I say to you?

1033
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,085
When I first saw you, you had...

1034
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:52,082
...a sort of aura that all actors
and actresses have.

1035
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:56,929
Well, since you're a playwright,
maybe you could use me sometime.

1036
01:13:56,885 --> 01:13:59,638
Yeah, maybe I could use you sometime.

1037
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:01,621
Mr. Swine...

1038
01:14:01,823 --> 01:14:04,053
...what does an actor-manager...

1039
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:07,242
...do with his spare time
in a small town like this?

1040
01:14:07,762 --> 01:14:09,912
Well, I don't have much spare time, but...

1041
01:14:09,964 --> 01:14:13,559
...I swim, play tennis, lift weights.

1042
01:14:13,968 --> 01:14:16,163
Gets rid of the excess energy.

1043
01:14:16,237 --> 01:14:19,115
What do you do with your excess energy?

1044
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:22,674
Well, we do a lot of things
with my excess energy.

1045
01:14:22,777 --> 01:14:25,007
One of the things we do a lot of is judo.

1046
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,276
- Did you ever hear about that?
- Judo!

1047
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:29,565
Yes, I've heard about it.

1048
01:14:29,851 --> 01:14:31,443
You do judo with the lady?

1049
01:14:31,419 --> 01:14:36,015
Yes, she's a yellow belt, I'm a green belt,
that's the way nature made it.

1050
01:14:36,024 --> 01:14:38,936
What happens is she throws me
all over the place.

1051
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,975
She throws you?

1052
01:14:40,028 --> 01:14:44,146
What she does, she gets me in a sort
of thing called a sweeping-ankle throw.

1053
01:14:44,165 --> 01:14:46,121
She sweeps my ankles from under me.

1054
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,673
- I go down with one hell of a bang.
- Doesn't it hurt?

1055
01:14:48,803 --> 01:14:51,476
I lay there in pain but I love it.
I really love it.

1056
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,910
I lay hovering between consciousness
and unconsciousness. It's the greatest.

1057
01:15:00,448 --> 01:15:01,517
Wow!

1058
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,603
This looks swank.

1059
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:10,166
- See you later.
- Okay.

1060
01:15:11,893 --> 01:15:13,008
Good evening.

1061
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,612
Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

1062
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:18,124
Yes, I'd like a room with a bath,
or, rather, two rooms with baths.

1063
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:20,135
Did you have a reservation, Mr?

1064
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:22,423
Humbert is the name.
No, I have no reservation.

1065
01:15:22,437 --> 01:15:25,588
Well, I'm afraid it'll be impossible
to accommodate you.

1066
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,226
This convention's got us tied up in knots.

1067
01:15:28,209 --> 01:15:29,688
Is it just you and the girl?

1068
01:15:29,844 --> 01:15:32,995
Yes. I would like you to accommodate us
because we're very tired.

1069
01:15:33,047 --> 01:15:34,275
Mr. Potts!

1070
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:36,061
Yes, Mr. Swine?

1071
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:38,245
What about Captain Love? Has he called?

1072
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:40,481
He's cancelled his reservation.

1073
01:15:40,588 --> 01:15:44,137
Well, I could give you 242.
It's a lovely room...

1074
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,400
...but it's only got one bed.

1075
01:15:47,128 --> 01:15:51,201
Well, perhaps you could find a folding bed
or a camp bed.

1076
01:15:51,332 --> 01:15:52,685
Potts, do we have any cots?

1077
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:55,301
No, the troopers have snapped them all up.

1078
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:59,581
I'm sure you'll find one room satisfactory.
Our double beds are really triple.

1079
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:01,598
One night we had three ladies
sleeping in one.

1080
01:16:01,676 --> 01:16:02,665
I'm sure we'll manage.

1081
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:06,744
Even if my wife joins me later,
we'll manage even then, I'm sure.

1082
01:16:06,681 --> 01:16:09,832
- Good. Would you mind registering?
- Certainly.

1083
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:15,476
By the way, what sort of a convention
are you holding here?

1084
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:19,708
We are very proud to have the overflow
of the State Police Convention.

1085
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:42,689
Perhaps if you just left them on the floor
that would be all right.

1086
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,159
Well, you can just leave them.

1087
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:51,623
Yes, that's fine.

1088
01:16:53,928 --> 01:16:55,407
Thank you very much.

1089
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,509
Thank you, sir.

1090
01:17:04,372 --> 01:17:05,441
Well?

1091
01:17:06,174 --> 01:17:08,165
Is this it?

1092
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,159
You mean?

1093
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:13,128
Yeah.

1094
01:17:14,949 --> 01:17:15,938
Yes.

1095
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:22,076
You see, I'm quite sure that they'll manage
to find a cot for us.

1096
01:17:22,123 --> 01:17:25,274
I asked them downstairs in the lobby
to find a cot.

1097
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,649
A cot?

1098
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:27,843
Yes.

1099
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:30,201
You're crazy.

1100
01:17:30,431 --> 01:17:32,103
Why, my darling?

1101
01:17:32,266 --> 01:17:35,497
Because, my darling,
when my darling mother finds out...

1102
01:17:35,503 --> 01:17:38,495
...she's going to divorce you
and strangle me.

1103
01:17:41,342 --> 01:17:43,253
Yes. Now, look, Lo...

1104
01:17:45,046 --> 01:17:47,196
I have a great feeling of...

1105
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:49,212
...tenderness for you.

1106
01:17:49,484 --> 01:17:53,443
While your mother is ill,
I'm responsible for your welfare.

1107
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:57,070
We're not rich, and while we travel
we shall be obliged...

1108
01:17:57,592 --> 01:18:00,345
We shall be thrown a good deal together...

1109
01:18:00,528 --> 01:18:04,601
...and two people sharing one room
inevitably enter into a kind of...

1110
01:18:05,299 --> 01:18:08,177
...how shall I say, a kind of...

1111
01:18:10,171 --> 01:18:13,243
Aren't you going to go down
and see about the cot?

1112
01:18:31,259 --> 01:18:33,454
Has there been a message for me
from my wife?

1113
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:37,373
I'm sorry, sir, nothing yet,
but we're working on that cot.

1114
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:38,659
Thank you.

1115
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:18,420
Hello.

1116
01:19:20,341 --> 01:19:21,933
You're addressing me!

1117
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:24,246
I thought perhaps there was someone
with you.

1118
01:19:24,278 --> 01:19:26,633
No, I'm not really with someone.
I'm with you.

1119
01:19:26,647 --> 01:19:27,796
I didn't mean that as an insult.

1120
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:32,127
What I meant was that
I'm with the State Police here, and...

1121
01:19:32,153 --> 01:19:35,384
...when I'm with them, I'm with someone,
but right now I'm on my own.

1122
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,778
I mean, I'm not with a lot of people,
just you.

1123
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:42,263
I wouldn't like to disturb you.
I'll leave you alone if you prefer it.

1124
01:19:42,296 --> 01:19:46,574
You don't really have to go at all.
I like it. I don't know what it is.

1125
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:49,752
I get the impression that you want to leave
but you don't like to...

1126
01:19:49,637 --> 01:19:53,869
...because you think I think it looks
suspicious, me being a policeman and all.

1127
01:19:54,408 --> 01:19:58,321
You don't have to think that because
I haven't got a suspicious mind at all.

1128
01:19:58,246 --> 01:20:02,637
A lot of people think I'm suspicious,
especially when I stand on street corners.

1129
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:04,322
One of our boys picked me up once.

1130
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:07,721
He thought that I was too suspicious
standing on the street corner.

1131
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:10,964
Tell me, I couldn't help noticing
when you checked in tonight...

1132
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:13,718
It's part of my job,
I notice human individuals...

1133
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:15,366
...and I noticed your face.

1134
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:17,399
I said to myself when I saw you...

1135
01:20:17,298 --> 01:20:20,893
...there's a guy with the most
normal-looking face I ever saw in my life.

1136
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:22,426
That's very nice of you.

1137
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:25,679
Not a bit. It's great to see a normal face,
'cause I'm a normal guy.

1138
01:20:25,673 --> 01:20:27,265
Be great for two normal guys...

1139
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:30,644
...to get together and talk about
world events, in a normal way.

1140
01:20:30,645 --> 01:20:34,524
There's nothing I would like better
than that, but I don't have much time.

1141
01:20:34,448 --> 01:20:37,360
It's a pity, because, may I say
one other thing to you?

1142
01:20:37,285 --> 01:20:39,321
I've been thinking about it a lot.

1143
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:42,895
I noticed when you was checking in
you had a lovely little girl with you.

1144
01:20:42,857 --> 01:20:44,006
She was really lovely.

1145
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:47,281
She wasn't so little, come to think of it.
She was fairly tall...

1146
01:20:47,295 --> 01:20:50,446
Taller than little, you know,
but she was really lovely.

1147
01:20:50,498 --> 01:20:53,615
I wish I had a pretty, tall,
lovely little girl like that...

1148
01:20:53,668 --> 01:20:55,021
That was my daughter.

1149
01:20:55,202 --> 01:20:57,841
Your daughter?
Isn't it great to have a lovely, tall...

1150
01:20:57,805 --> 01:21:00,603
...pretty, little daughter like that?
It's wonderful.

1151
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:03,692
I don't have any children or boys
or little tall girls.

1152
01:21:03,577 --> 01:21:05,568
I'm not even... Are you married?

1153
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:08,437
Yes, I'm expecting my wife,
perhaps, to come here.

1154
01:21:08,349 --> 01:21:11,625
May I say something?
I thought you looked uneasy at the desk.

1155
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:14,577
I was thinking that you want to get away
from your wife.

1156
01:21:14,488 --> 01:21:18,401
I don't blame you. If I was married
I'd take every opportunity to get away!

1157
01:21:18,326 --> 01:21:20,920
Yes. No, that was not it at all.

1158
01:21:21,696 --> 01:21:25,575
As a matter of fact, it's possible
that my wife won't join me because...

1159
01:21:25,499 --> 01:21:27,615
...when I left home she was not well.

1160
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:29,537
What was the matter with your wife?

1161
01:21:29,437 --> 01:21:31,632
It's not important... She had an accident.

1162
01:21:31,672 --> 01:21:36,302
She had an accident! That's terrible!
Fancy a normal guy's wife having...

1163
01:21:36,277 --> 01:21:38,996
...an accident like that!
What happened to her?

1164
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,652
She was hit by a car.

1165
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:44,390
No wonder she's not here.
You must feel pretty bad about that.

1166
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:47,788
What's happening?
Is she coming later, or something?

1167
01:21:47,788 --> 01:21:49,858
Well, that was the understanding.

1168
01:21:49,924 --> 01:21:53,439
What, in an ambulance?
I'm sorry I said that. I shouldn't say that.

1169
01:21:53,427 --> 01:21:55,987
I get sort of carried away,
being so normal and all.

1170
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:59,286
When you were at the desk
checking in with the night manager...

1171
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,497
...Mr. George Swine, who I happen
to know as a personal friend...

1172
01:22:02,536 --> 01:22:05,892
...I was wondering if he fixed you up
with a good accommodation here.

1173
01:22:05,906 --> 01:22:07,942
Yes, they were extremely cooperative.

1174
01:22:07,842 --> 01:22:10,959
You sure? Because I could easily
have a word with George Swine.

1175
01:22:10,978 --> 01:22:13,446
He's a really normal, nice sort of guy...

1176
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:15,836
...and I've only got to have
a normal word in his ear...

1177
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:18,364
...and you'd be surprised
what things could happen.

1178
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,755
He'd probably turn some troopers out,
so you could have a lovely room...

1179
01:22:21,756 --> 01:22:23,951
...a bridal suite, for you
and your lovely girl.

1180
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:26,585
I don't want you to take any trouble
on my account.

1181
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,039
We're perfectly comfortable.

1182
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:30,941
It's his job to fix you up
with something nice.

1183
01:22:30,865 --> 01:22:32,981
He gets paid for doing that and...

1184
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:35,381
...when he sees a guy like you, all normal...

1185
01:22:35,336 --> 01:22:37,804
...with a lovely girl,
he should say to himself:

1186
01:22:37,805 --> 01:22:41,844
"I got to give that guy a lovely sort
of comfortable, foamy bed to sleep in."

1187
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:45,827
I don't like to hear things like that,
'cause I could go and take a swipe at him...

1188
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,634
...for not giving you a lovely, comfortable,
sleepy, movie-star bed.

1189
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,460
You know what I mean?

1190
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:53,882
What has he got you on
the floor or something?

1191
01:22:53,921 --> 01:22:57,800
Well, the little girl is probably asleep
already in the bed and...

1192
01:22:58,526 --> 01:23:02,439
...I don't know why we're discussing...
- Why don't you let me have a look...

1193
01:23:02,363 --> 01:23:05,639
...at the accommodation that you have,
and take it in for a second...

1194
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:08,817
...then I can have a word with
George Swine? It would be simple.

1195
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:11,588
No, you really shouldn't worry
about either of us.

1196
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:13,655
Which reminds me,
I should go upstairs now.

1197
01:23:13,707 --> 01:23:15,698
You're going because you think that...

1198
01:23:15,776 --> 01:23:19,007
...me being a policeman,
I'd think you were sort of suspicious?

1199
01:23:19,113 --> 01:23:22,105
I don't think that at all.
I think you're really normal.

1200
01:23:22,016 --> 01:23:26,134
- You don't have to go because of that.
- No. It's been very nice talking to you.

1201
01:23:26,053 --> 01:23:29,807
Before you go, I was wondering whether
maybe in the morning, you know...

1202
01:23:29,757 --> 01:23:33,545
...me being lonely and normal...
- We have to get up at the crack of dawn.

1203
01:23:33,494 --> 01:23:35,928
- We can have breakfast.
- That's very nice, but...

1204
01:23:35,896 --> 01:23:38,888
I can arrange it with George Swine.
He could have it laid out.

1205
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:41,128
Well, thank you so much. Goodnight.

1206
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:44,037
You have a most interesting face.
Goodnight.

1207
01:23:47,908 --> 01:23:49,023
Excuse me.

1208
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:52,424
Hush, hush, she's asleep.

1209
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:54,370
Good evening. I brought the cot, sir.

1210
01:23:54,415 --> 01:23:56,087
Yes. I see you did.

1211
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:58,800
We don't need it now, so take it away.

1212
01:23:58,686 --> 01:24:00,722
- You don't need the cot?
- No, she's asleep.

1213
01:24:00,754 --> 01:24:03,905
- I won't make any noise.
- That's not the point.

1214
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:07,147
Two of the troopers agreed to double up.
That's how I got the cot, sir.

1215
01:24:07,161 --> 01:24:09,880
Well, in that case, all right... bring it in.

1216
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:12,822
But no noise, please. Quietly.

1217
01:25:56,503 --> 01:25:57,822
We did it, sir.

1218
01:26:15,055 --> 01:26:16,568
Thank you, sir.

1219
01:27:15,349 --> 01:27:16,338
Hello.

1220
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:21,406
The cot came.

1221
01:27:23,324 --> 01:27:24,313
Yes.

1222
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,549
Well...

1223
01:27:28,796 --> 01:27:29,990
...goodnight.

1224
01:28:41,668 --> 01:28:43,943
Wake up, Humbert, the hotel's on fire!

1225
01:28:45,339 --> 01:28:46,818
The hotel's on fire, quick!

1226
01:28:46,807 --> 01:28:48,843
What? The hotel's on fire?

1227
01:28:48,742 --> 01:28:50,255
Get out of bed real quick!

1228
01:28:50,244 --> 01:28:53,042
Quick, it's burning right down
to the ground!

1229
01:28:55,182 --> 01:28:58,777
Why did you have to wake me?
I only just got to sleep.

1230
01:29:01,255 --> 01:29:02,244
Very funny.

1231
01:29:02,322 --> 01:29:05,792
By the way, what happened to your bed?
It looks a lot lower.

1232
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:10,199
Well, the bed collapsed.
It's a collapsible bed.

1233
01:29:16,303 --> 01:29:17,861
What time is it?

1234
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:21,286
It's breakfast time.

1235
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,963
You know, my tan is much darker
than yours now.

1236
01:29:25,913 --> 01:29:27,949
That's not strictly true.

1237
01:29:28,015 --> 01:29:30,449
You're a very fair-skinned lady.

1238
01:29:34,221 --> 01:29:36,177
Look at that. That's very interesting.

1239
01:29:36,056 --> 01:29:37,171
Yeah.

1240
01:29:37,057 --> 01:29:38,809
What else can you do?

1241
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:43,111
Well, this little thumb can go
all the way back to my wrist, see?

1242
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:46,137
Yes, I can see. You're very talented.

1243
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:49,278
Boy, you need a shave!

1244
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:52,900
Of course I need a shave because
I've not shaved since yesterday morning...

1245
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,090
...and I'm a man who needs...

1246
01:29:55,876 --> 01:29:57,355
...two shaves a day.

1247
01:29:58,378 --> 01:30:00,448
Do you always have to shave twice a day?

1248
01:30:00,347 --> 01:30:02,065
Yes, of course.

1249
01:30:02,983 --> 01:30:05,292
All the best people shave twice a day.

1250
01:30:11,058 --> 01:30:12,616
What shall we do now?

1251
01:30:14,728 --> 01:30:16,923
You ring down and order breakfast.

1252
01:30:17,898 --> 01:30:19,536
No, I don't want to do that.

1253
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,616
Well, what do you want to do?

1254
01:30:24,371 --> 01:30:26,248
Why don't we play a game?

1255
01:30:26,773 --> 01:30:28,411
A game? Come on.

1256
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:31,398
No, you get on to room service at once.

1257
01:30:31,945 --> 01:30:33,060
No, really.

1258
01:30:32,946 --> 01:30:36,541
I learned some real good games in camp.

1259
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:39,601
One in "particularly" was fun.

1260
01:30:40,254 --> 01:30:45,044
Well, why don't you describe this one
in "particularly" good game.

1261
01:30:45,893 --> 01:30:47,884
Well, I played it with Charlie.

1262
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:51,235
Charlie? Who's he?

1263
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:53,388
Charlie?

1264
01:30:54,034 --> 01:30:56,502
He's that guy that you met in the office.

1265
01:30:57,271 --> 01:30:58,909
You mean that boy?

1266
01:30:59,907 --> 01:31:01,022
You and he?

1267
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:02,898
Yeah.

1268
01:31:05,245 --> 01:31:08,442
Are you sure you can't guess what game
I'm talking about?

1269
01:31:11,018 --> 01:31:13,134
I'm not a very good guesser.

1270
01:31:24,932 --> 01:31:27,048
I don't know what game you played.

1271
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,930
You mean, you never played that game
when you were a kid?

1272
01:31:37,578 --> 01:31:38,613
No.

1273
01:31:40,213 --> 01:31:41,612
All righty then.

1274
01:32:07,841 --> 01:32:10,036
Have you ever kissed the Blarney Stone?

1275
01:32:10,077 --> 01:32:12,432
No, that's something I never did.

1276
01:32:12,613 --> 01:32:14,604
Boy, I sure wish I could.

1277
01:32:14,848 --> 01:32:17,601
Perhaps sometime we can organize a trip.

1278
01:32:22,856 --> 01:32:24,448
Hey, let's tell Mother.

1279
01:32:25,058 --> 01:32:26,571
Tell Mother what?

1280
01:32:26,893 --> 01:32:28,167
You know what.

1281
01:32:29,196 --> 01:32:32,233
No, I don't think that would be very funny.

1282
01:32:32,099 --> 01:32:34,215
I wonder what she'd do.

1283
01:32:36,169 --> 01:32:41,163
If you don't stop eating those chips
you won't have any appetite for your lunch.

1284
01:32:44,144 --> 01:32:46,612
Did you see that? A squashed cat.

1285
01:32:47,514 --> 01:32:49,232
Boy, that's terrible.

1286
01:32:49,349 --> 01:32:51,465
I hate things like that.

1287
01:32:56,223 --> 01:32:58,259
You know what I'd like for lunch?

1288
01:32:58,158 --> 01:32:59,477
No, tell me.

1289
01:32:59,693 --> 01:33:02,571
A big plate of French fries and a malt.

1290
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:15,695
How long until we get to Lepingsville?

1291
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:20,227
Well, I'm beginning to think that
perhaps we won't make it this evening.

1292
01:33:20,514 --> 01:33:23,233
We got off to rather a slow start,
remember?

1293
01:33:24,117 --> 01:33:26,073
Can we go to a movie tonight?

1294
01:33:25,986 --> 01:33:27,704
If that's what you'd like.

1295
01:33:28,021 --> 01:33:29,010
I would.

1296
01:33:30,657 --> 01:33:34,286
Have you ever seen any of those,
you know, those foreign films?

1297
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,783
Yes, frequently.

1298
01:33:38,465 --> 01:33:40,057
I don't like 'em.

1299
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:48,007
Will you stop at the next gas station?

1300
01:33:48,108 --> 01:33:49,177
All right.

1301
01:33:52,045 --> 01:33:54,320
You're feeling all right, aren't you?

1302
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:57,418
I feel fine.
I want to call Mother at that hospital.

1303
01:33:57,718 --> 01:33:59,310
What's the number?

1304
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:06,602
Don't you know the number?

1305
01:34:08,628 --> 01:34:12,780
I think it will be just as well if you wait
until we get to Lepingsville.

1306
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:16,225
Why? What difference does it make?
I want to call her.

1307
01:34:16,303 --> 01:34:19,101
I just don't think it'd be a very good idea.

1308
01:34:19,005 --> 01:34:21,394
Why can't I call my mother if I want to?

1309
01:34:22,509 --> 01:34:24,227
Because you can't.

1310
01:34:24,444 --> 01:34:25,513
Why?

1311
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:30,652
Because...

1312
01:34:33,153 --> 01:34:34,745
...your mother is dead.

1313
01:34:40,594 --> 01:34:43,427
Come on now, cut it out!
Why can't I call her?

1314
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:46,128
Your mother is dead.

1315
01:35:58,705 --> 01:36:00,661
Try to stop crying.

1316
01:36:02,442 --> 01:36:06,594
- Everything's going to be all right.
- Nothing will ever be all right.

1317
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:14,743
I'm sure that we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

1318
01:36:16,089 --> 01:36:18,649
But everything has changed
all of a sudden.

1319
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:22,300
Everything was so, I don't know, normal.

1320
01:36:24,331 --> 01:36:26,686
Lolita, please, please don't cry.

1321
01:36:28,768 --> 01:36:31,202
We'll do things. We'll go places.

1322
01:36:31,471 --> 01:36:33,746
But there's no place to go back to.

1323
01:36:35,542 --> 01:36:36,975
We'll find a new home.

1324
01:36:37,143 --> 01:36:38,132
Where?

1325
01:36:40,647 --> 01:36:42,205
Beardsley!

1326
01:36:42,382 --> 01:36:44,532
My lectureship starts in September.

1327
01:36:44,718 --> 01:36:46,868
It's in Ohio. You'll like it there.

1328
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,515
I'll hate it. I know I will.

1329
01:36:49,556 --> 01:36:52,389
No, you won't. It's a wonderful place.

1330
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,877
But what about all my things
back in Ramsdale?

1331
01:36:56,897 --> 01:36:58,296
And the house?

1332
01:36:58,298 --> 01:37:00,289
I'll take care of all those things.

1333
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:02,767
What things do you want specially?

1334
01:37:03,236 --> 01:37:06,626
My record player and my records.

1335
01:37:07,707 --> 01:37:12,462
We'll send for them and,
in the meantime, I can buy you new ones...

1336
01:37:12,412 --> 01:37:14,448
...to take the place of the old ones.

1337
01:37:14,481 --> 01:37:19,555
I'll buy you the best hi-fi set
that you ever saw and all the new records.

1338
01:37:20,787 --> 01:37:22,300
There, there.

1339
01:37:22,956 --> 01:37:25,390
We can't stay in Beardsley forever.

1340
01:37:26,192 --> 01:37:27,944
Where's that handkerchief?

1341
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:36,426
Promise me something?

1342
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:37,643
Yes, anything.

1343
01:37:41,775 --> 01:37:45,245
Promise you'll never leave me.
I don't want to ever be...

1344
01:37:45,211 --> 01:37:48,521
...in one of those horrible places
for juvenile delinquents.

1345
01:37:48,548 --> 01:37:51,540
Whatever makes you think that,
that would happen to you?

1346
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:52,964
I know it would...

1347
01:37:53,253 --> 01:37:55,289
...and anyway, I'd rather be with you.

1348
01:37:55,355 --> 01:37:57,949
You're a lot better
than one of those places.

1349
01:37:59,893 --> 01:38:01,884
You will promise, won't you?

1350
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:04,042
Yes, I promise.

1351
01:38:04,397 --> 01:38:06,592
Cross your heart and hope to die?

1352
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,392
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1353
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:17,525
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1354
01:38:22,015 --> 01:38:24,245
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1355
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:34,829
You must now forget Ramsdale
and poor Charlotte and poor Lolita...

1356
01:38:35,428 --> 01:38:38,818
...and poor Humbert, and accompany us
to Beardsley College...

1357
01:38:38,865 --> 01:38:42,699
...where my lectureship in French poetry
is in its second semester.

1358
01:38:43,403 --> 01:38:46,713
Six months have passed and Lolita
is attending an excellent school...

1359
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,890
...where I hope that
she will be persuaded...

1360
01:38:48,775 --> 01:38:52,688
...to read other things than comic books
and movie romances.

1361
01:39:06,393 --> 01:39:09,942
Why were you so late coming home
from school yesterday afternoon?

1362
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:13,569
Yesterday? Yesterday?
What was yesterday?

1363
01:39:13,566 --> 01:39:15,158
Yesterday was Thursday.

1364
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:17,371
Oh, well. Was I late?

1365
01:39:17,637 --> 01:39:18,911
Yes, you were.

1366
01:39:19,572 --> 01:39:22,769
You finished school at 3:00.
You were not home until 6:00.

1367
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:27,125
That's right, that's right. Michele and I...

1368
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,510
...stayed to watch football practice.

1369
01:39:29,582 --> 01:39:31,061
In the Frigid Queen?

1370
01:39:31,718 --> 01:39:33,754
What do you mean, in the Frigid Queen?

1371
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:37,972
I was driving around and I thought
I saw you through the window.

1372
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:42,737
Yeah, well, we stopped there
for a malt afterwards.

1373
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:44,698
What difference does it make?

1374
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:47,065
You were sitting at a table with two boys.

1375
01:39:49,002 --> 01:39:51,641
Roy and Rex just happened
to sit down with us.

1376
01:39:51,604 --> 01:39:52,923
Roy and Rex?

1377
01:39:53,506 --> 01:39:55,781
The co-captains of the football team.

1378
01:39:55,909 --> 01:39:58,059
I thought we understood: No dates.

1379
01:39:58,378 --> 01:40:01,575
What do you mean, no dates?
They just sat down at our table.

1380
01:40:01,614 --> 01:40:05,129
I don't want you around them.
They're nasty-minded boys.

1381
01:40:05,885 --> 01:40:08,604
You're a fine one to talk
about someone else's mind!

1382
01:40:08,555 --> 01:40:11,706
Don't avoid the issue. I told you no dates!

1383
01:40:12,492 --> 01:40:13,845
It wasn't a date.

1384
01:40:14,027 --> 01:40:15,016
It was a date!

1385
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:17,404
- It wasn't a date.
- It was a date, Lolita.

1386
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:19,546
- It was not a date.
- It was a date.

1387
01:40:20,366 --> 01:40:21,685
It wasn't a date.

1388
01:40:21,701 --> 01:40:25,216
Whatever you had yesterday,
I don't want you to have it again.

1389
01:40:25,338 --> 01:40:26,691
While we're on the subject...

1390
01:40:26,706 --> 01:40:29,539
...how did you come to be so late
on Saturday afternoon?

1391
01:40:29,476 --> 01:40:31,148
Saturday I went to my piano lesson.

1392
01:40:31,111 --> 01:40:34,148
Your piano lesson?
I thought that was on Wednesday.

1393
01:40:34,013 --> 01:40:36,527
No, it's changed to Saturday, remember?

1394
01:40:36,516 --> 01:40:39,030
Between 2:00 and 4:00, Miss Starch, piano.

1395
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,622
Ask Michele. She was with me.

1396
01:40:41,721 --> 01:40:43,916
"Ask Michele," that's what you always say.

1397
01:40:43,957 --> 01:40:47,916
Well, now for a change, I'm going
to ask you something about Michele.

1398
01:40:48,561 --> 01:40:51,029
You can't have her.
She belongs to a Marine.

1399
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:53,146
I will ignore that idiotic joke.

1400
01:40:54,567 --> 01:40:58,526
Why does she give me searching looks
whenever she comes to the house?

1401
01:40:58,671 --> 01:41:00,070
How should I know?

1402
01:41:00,073 --> 01:41:02,109
Have you told her anything about us?

1403
01:41:02,175 --> 01:41:03,733
No, have you?

1404
01:41:04,144 --> 01:41:07,181
- You've told her nothing?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1405
01:41:07,847 --> 01:41:11,999
You spend too much time with that girl.
I don't want you to see her so often.

1406
01:41:12,185 --> 01:41:16,497
Come on, she's the only friend I've got
in this stinking world.

1407
01:41:17,123 --> 01:41:19,273
You never let me have any fun.

1408
01:41:19,592 --> 01:41:23,790
No fun? You have all the fun in the world!
We have fun together, don't we?

1409
01:41:24,564 --> 01:41:27,556
Whenever you want something
I buy it for you automatically.

1410
01:41:27,433 --> 01:41:30,027
I take you to concerts,
to museums, to movies.

1411
01:41:30,003 --> 01:41:31,641
I do all the housework!

1412
01:41:31,604 --> 01:41:33,834
Who does the tidying up? I do.

1413
01:41:34,174 --> 01:41:36,210
Who does the cooking? I do.

1414
01:41:36,176 --> 01:41:39,452
You and I, we have lots of fun,
don't we, Lolita?

1415
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:44,585
Come here.

1416
01:42:00,633 --> 01:42:01,907
Still love me?

1417
01:42:04,103 --> 01:42:06,537
Completely. You know that.

1418
01:42:07,674 --> 01:42:10,905
You know what I want more
than anything else in the world?

1419
01:42:10,977 --> 01:42:12,729
No. What do you want?

1420
01:42:13,846 --> 01:42:15,962
I want you to be proud of me.

1421
01:42:16,516 --> 01:42:18,666
But I am proud of you, Lolita.

1422
01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:21,702
No, I mean really proud of me.

1423
01:42:21,754 --> 01:42:24,188
They want me for the lead
in the school play.

1424
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,908
Isn't that fantastic?

1425
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:29,197
I have to have a letter from you,
giving your permission.

1426
01:42:29,095 --> 01:42:30,528
Who wants you?

1427
01:42:30,997 --> 01:42:34,990
Well, Edusa Gold, the drama teacher,
Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom.

1428
01:42:35,068 --> 01:42:36,786
And who might they be?

1429
01:42:36,736 --> 01:42:39,694
The authors. They're here
to supervise the production.

1430
01:42:39,606 --> 01:42:41,198
But you've never acted before.

1431
01:42:41,174 --> 01:42:43,290
They say I have a unique and rare talent.

1432
01:42:43,476 --> 01:42:44,955
And how do they know that?

1433
01:42:44,944 --> 01:42:48,095
We had readings and I was chosen
over 30 other girls.

1434
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,211
That's the first I've heard about it.

1435
01:42:50,283 --> 01:42:52,797
I know, I wanted to surprise you.

1436
01:42:52,785 --> 01:42:55,777
And I suppose that Roy has a part
in this production?

1437
01:42:55,989 --> 01:42:57,786
Roy? What's he got to do with this?

1438
01:42:57,724 --> 01:43:01,080
Roy and Rex, naturally,
I suppose they're in it.

1439
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,754
How do I know?
I only met them yesterday.

1440
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:05,766
Besides, they're football players,
not actors.

1441
01:43:05,832 --> 01:43:09,871
And you suddenly, overnight are
an actress. It's out of the question.

1442
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:13,228
- Out of the question!
- I don't want you in that atmosphere.

1443
01:43:13,139 --> 01:43:14,936
What atmosphere? It's a school play!

1444
01:43:14,874 --> 01:43:17,946
I've told you, I don't want you mixing
with those boys.

1445
01:43:17,844 --> 01:43:21,996
It's just another excuse to make dates
with them, and to get close with them.

1446
01:43:22,682 --> 01:43:25,071
- You don't love me.
- I do love you.

1447
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:27,724
- You don't love me.
- I do love you, Lolita.

1448
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,678
You're driving me crazy.
You won't let me do anything.

1449
01:43:30,556 --> 01:43:33,992
You just want to keep me locked up
with you in this filthy house.

1450
01:43:33,993 --> 01:43:37,952
Now, dear, go and wash your face.
I'll go downstairs and start the roast.

1451
01:43:37,864 --> 01:43:39,661
Someday you'll regret this.

1452
01:43:39,565 --> 01:43:43,399
- I'll go downstairs and start the roast.
- You'll be sorry you won't...

1453
01:43:43,636 --> 01:43:45,627
And don't smudge your toenails.

1454
01:44:04,991 --> 01:44:05,980
Lo?

1455
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:14,242
Good evening, Dr. Humbert.

1456
01:44:19,272 --> 01:44:20,625
Who are you?

1457
01:44:21,174 --> 01:44:23,165
I am Dr. Zemph.

1458
01:44:24,077 --> 01:44:26,671
Dr. Humbert, I am pleased to meet you.

1459
01:44:26,746 --> 01:44:29,738
I am the Beardsley High School
psychologist.

1460
01:44:29,882 --> 01:44:33,079
Have you been here?
I mean, how did you get in?

1461
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,952
Your little daughter opened
the door to me...

1462
01:44:35,922 --> 01:44:38,038
...on the way to her piano lesson...

1463
01:44:37,924 --> 01:44:41,121
...and she said I was to wait in here
until your arrival.

1464
01:44:41,294 --> 01:44:42,807
So here I am.

1465
01:44:42,895 --> 01:44:44,772
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

1466
01:44:44,697 --> 01:44:48,372
I sat in the dark so as to save you
the expense of the electricity.

1467
01:44:48,634 --> 01:44:50,750
That was very considerate of you.

1468
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,223
A great pleasure.

1469
01:44:55,141 --> 01:44:57,257
What can I do for you, Dr. Zemph?

1470
01:44:58,277 --> 01:45:03,271
Dr. Humbert, would you mind
if I am putting to you the blunt question?

1471
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:05,881
No, by all means do so.

1472
01:45:06,919 --> 01:45:12,915
We are wondering, has anybody
instructed Lolita in the facts of life?

1473
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,151
- The facts?
- The facts of life.

1474
01:45:16,062 --> 01:45:18,371
You see, Lolita is a sweet, little child...

1475
01:45:18,398 --> 01:45:21,549
...but the onset of maturity seems
to be giving her...

1476
01:45:21,434 --> 01:45:23,584
...a certain amount of trouble.

1477
01:45:24,837 --> 01:45:28,068
I really don't think that this is a fit topic.

1478
01:45:28,374 --> 01:45:33,732
Well, Dr. Humbert, to you she is still
the little girl that is cradled in the arms...

1479
01:45:34,647 --> 01:45:37,844
...but to those boys over there
at the Beardsley High...

1480
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:41,770
She is a lovely girl, you know...

1481
01:45:42,355 --> 01:45:44,346
...with the swing, you know, and the jazz...

1482
01:45:44,424 --> 01:45:48,019
...and she has got the curvatures
which they take a lot of notice of.

1483
01:45:47,994 --> 01:45:49,825
You and I, what are we?

1484
01:45:49,829 --> 01:45:52,389
We are symbols of power,
sitting in our offices.

1485
01:45:52,331 --> 01:45:55,209
We are making the signatures,
writing the contracts...

1486
01:45:55,134 --> 01:45:57,284
...and decisions all the time.

1487
01:45:57,203 --> 01:45:59,194
But if we cast our minds back...

1488
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:01,957
Just think, what were we only yesterday?

1489
01:46:02,074 --> 01:46:04,065
Yesterday, Dr. Humbert...

1490
01:46:04,343 --> 01:46:07,062
...you and I were little High School Jim...

1491
01:46:07,046 --> 01:46:10,004
...and we were carrying
High School Jane's schoolbooks.

1492
01:46:09,882 --> 01:46:11,600
You remember those days?

1493
01:46:12,852 --> 01:46:17,368
In point of fact, Dr. Zemph,
I am a lecturer in French literature.

1494
01:46:18,925 --> 01:46:23,874
I have not made my point quite clear.

1495
01:46:25,331 --> 01:46:29,768
I have some other details which
I would like to put to you, Dr. Humbert.

1496
01:46:31,337 --> 01:46:35,376
"She is defiant and rude.
Sighs a good deal in the class."

1497
01:46:35,441 --> 01:46:37,511
She sighs, makes the sound of...

1498
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:41,400
"Chews gum vehemently."
All the time she is chewing this gum.

1499
01:46:41,414 --> 01:46:43,086
"Handles books gracefully."

1500
01:46:43,049 --> 01:46:45,165
That doesn't really matter.
"Voice is pleasant.

1501
01:46:45,218 --> 01:46:48,494
"Giggles rather often and is excitable."
She giggles at things.

1502
01:46:48,521 --> 01:46:51,354
"A little dreamy. Concentration is poor."

1503
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:54,919
She looks at the book for a while
and then she gets fed up with it.

1504
01:46:54,894 --> 01:46:56,293
"Has private jokes of her own."

1505
01:46:56,295 --> 01:46:59,446
Which no one understands
so they can't enjoy them with her.

1506
01:46:59,332 --> 01:47:03,166
"She either has exceptional control
or she has no control at all."

1507
01:47:03,102 --> 01:47:04,933
We cannot decide which.

1508
01:47:05,137 --> 01:47:09,289
Added to that, just yesterday,
Dr. Humbert...

1509
01:47:09,408 --> 01:47:14,118
...she wrote a most obscene word
with the lipstick, if you please...

1510
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,071
...on the health pamphlet.

1511
01:47:16,749 --> 01:47:22,426
And so, in our opinion, she is suffering
from acute repression of the libido...

1512
01:47:22,421 --> 01:47:24,412
...of the natural instincts.

1513
01:47:26,559 --> 01:47:29,232
I fail to see the significance of all this...

1514
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:32,631
...as far as her record as a student
is concerned, Dr. Zemph.

1515
01:47:34,066 --> 01:47:35,499
We Americans...

1516
01:47:36,269 --> 01:47:38,419
...we are progressively modern.

1517
01:47:39,272 --> 01:47:44,141
We believe that it is equally important
to prepare the pupils...

1518
01:47:44,443 --> 01:47:48,561
...for the mutually satisfactory mating
and the successful child rearing.

1519
01:47:48,814 --> 01:47:50,452
That is what we believe.

1520
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:51,610
What do you suggest?

1521
01:47:51,817 --> 01:47:53,170
I am suggesting...

1522
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,630
...that Dr. Cudler, who is the district
psychologist to the Board of Education...

1523
01:47:58,858 --> 01:48:02,976
...should visit you in the home with
his three member board of psychologists...

1524
01:48:02,828 --> 01:48:06,662
...and once they are in the home
they can investigate thoroughly...

1525
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:09,591
...in the home situation,
with all four of them.

1526
01:48:14,006 --> 01:48:16,122
The home situation?

1527
01:48:16,309 --> 01:48:20,222
So that they can get straight
at the source of the repression.

1528
01:48:20,446 --> 01:48:23,085
But she's not being repressed, Dr. Zemph.

1529
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:27,943
Do I take it then that
you are refusing to cooperate...

1530
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,488
...with Dr. Cudler and his men?

1531
01:48:30,523 --> 01:48:34,038
I am not refusing anything at all,
but please understand me.

1532
01:48:33,993 --> 01:48:37,065
- No, I don't want to...
- What? What are you saying then?

1533
01:48:36,963 --> 01:48:38,999
I absolutely refuse...

1534
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:42,508
...to have a quartet
of strange psychologists...

1535
01:48:43,069 --> 01:48:44,980
...nosing around my house.

1536
01:48:46,505 --> 01:48:48,177
Dr. Humbert...

1537
01:48:49,108 --> 01:48:50,985
...l'm afraid that...

1538
01:48:51,444 --> 01:48:53,560
...you may have no choice.

1539
01:48:54,013 --> 01:48:55,162
Cigarette?

1540
01:48:55,514 --> 01:48:56,503
No choice?

1541
01:48:56,582 --> 01:48:57,651
No choice.

1542
01:48:59,051 --> 01:49:00,279
Keep the pack.

1543
01:49:01,587 --> 01:49:04,260
Look, Dr. Humbert...

1544
01:49:04,857 --> 01:49:07,815
...I don't wish to take this
to a higher level of authority...

1545
01:49:07,893 --> 01:49:10,965
...if I can possibly help it. Understand?
- I should hope not.

1546
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:13,305
So you must help me.

1547
01:49:16,669 --> 01:49:18,102
What can I do?

1548
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:22,104
I don't know, but perhaps there is
another approach that we can take...

1549
01:49:22,041 --> 01:49:26,193
...something new altogether,
some new approach. What would you say?

1550
01:49:26,345 --> 01:49:27,539
Would you like that?

1551
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:32,574
Some new area of adjustment
that Lolita could find...

1552
01:49:32,685 --> 01:49:37,122
...perhaps by taking a larger share
of the extracurricular school activities?

1553
01:49:37,323 --> 01:49:41,680
I have never objected to her taking part
in the extracurricular...

1554
01:49:42,895 --> 01:49:44,453
- School activities.
- Pardon me.

1555
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:47,422
You see, we have questioned Lolita
on the home situation...

1556
01:49:47,466 --> 01:49:50,538
...but she says not a word,
stays with her lips buttoned up.

1557
01:49:50,436 --> 01:49:54,065
So we are speaking with her friends,
and they are saying things...

1558
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,395
...which I wouldn't repeat to you here.

1559
01:49:56,442 --> 01:50:00,594
But there is one thing which has arisen
from this which is quite clear:

1560
01:50:00,513 --> 01:50:04,711
That you, Dr. Humbert,
should definitely un-veto that girl's...

1561
01:50:05,151 --> 01:50:08,143
...nonparticipation in the school play.

1562
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:16,780
Perhaps I was wrong in the attitude
that I took about the school play.

1563
01:50:16,962 --> 01:50:19,840
That's very big of you to admit that.
While you're at it...

1564
01:50:19,932 --> 01:50:23,004
...why don't you also loosen up
a bit more on the other two D's...

1565
01:50:23,069 --> 01:50:25,185
...the "dating" and the "dance"?

1566
01:50:26,172 --> 01:50:28,481
Do you think that those are
equally important?

1567
01:50:28,507 --> 01:50:30,657
Dr. Humbert, I tell you what I do think.

1568
01:50:30,543 --> 01:50:35,094
I feel that you and I should do all
in our power to stop that old Dr. Cudler...

1569
01:50:35,114 --> 01:50:38,151
...and his quartet of psychologists
from fiddling around...

1570
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:41,247
...in the home situation. That's what I feel.

1571
01:50:41,487 --> 01:50:43,637
Don't you agree with me?

1572
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:56,183
I stand before you,
a rearsome bucky goat no more.

1573
01:50:56,469 --> 01:50:58,380
Tremble not, little nymph.

1574
01:50:58,337 --> 01:51:00,851
You see before you a weary goat.

1575
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:04,111
The bewitcher is bewitched.

1576
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:06,348
Look, Semiramis, look!

1577
01:51:06,312 --> 01:51:08,462
Yes, the goat removeth his horns.

1578
01:51:08,347 --> 01:51:10,463
Let us take him to the Dark Kingdom.

1579
01:51:10,349 --> 01:51:11,338
Yes.

1580
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:13,684
To the Dark Kingdom, away, away!

1581
01:51:25,464 --> 01:51:27,341
Why, good evening, Dr. Humbert!

1582
01:51:27,266 --> 01:51:28,745
Miss Starch! Good evening!

1583
01:51:28,734 --> 01:51:32,852
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- Very much. I enjoyed every minute of it.

1584
01:51:32,738 --> 01:51:35,775
I wondered if the symbolism
wasn't heavy-handed at times.

1585
01:51:35,674 --> 01:51:39,462
I know what you mean,
but weren't the boys and girls charming?

1586
01:51:39,411 --> 01:51:42,483
They were, weren't they?
And particularly little Lolita.

1587
01:51:42,548 --> 01:51:45,699
She was quite perfect.
You must be awfully proud of her.

1588
01:51:45,551 --> 01:51:49,260
Yes, I am. You know, her performance
took me completely by surprise!

1589
01:51:49,221 --> 01:51:51,894
She made me promise not to watch
any of the rehearsals.

1590
01:51:52,024 --> 01:51:53,855
They're so intense at that age.

1591
01:51:53,793 --> 01:51:55,863
She must have worked awfully hard.

1592
01:51:55,761 --> 01:51:58,434
No wonder you decided
to suspend her piano lessons.

1593
01:51:58,397 --> 01:51:59,876
After all, there are only...

1594
01:52:00,032 --> 01:52:02,671
I beg your pardon, did you say,
"suspend her piano lessons"?

1595
01:52:02,635 --> 01:52:03,624
Yes.

1596
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:06,684
- Do you play, Dr. Humbert?
- Hardly at all now.

1597
01:52:06,672 --> 01:52:09,311
Didn't she have a lesson with you
last Saturday?

1598
01:52:09,241 --> 01:52:10,196
No.

1599
01:52:10,109 --> 01:52:11,781
Nor the preceding Saturday?

1600
01:52:11,744 --> 01:52:14,304
No. She called to say
she was busy rehearsing.

1601
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,633
Busy rehearsing?

1602
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:18,832
As a matter of fact,
she hasn't had a lesson for...

1603
01:52:19,151 --> 01:52:20,869
...let me see, four weeks!

1604
01:52:21,754 --> 01:52:23,790
I hope I haven't spoken out of turn.

1605
01:52:23,689 --> 01:52:26,726
No, no, not at all.
I must have misunderstood.

1606
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,269
By the way, Dr. Humbert,
there's so few people in Beardsley...

1607
01:52:31,263 --> 01:52:33,902
...who appreciate music,
I was wondering, sometime...

1608
01:52:33,866 --> 01:52:36,938
...if you'd like to come by
I could play something for you.

1609
01:52:36,836 --> 01:52:40,749
Yes, of course, certainly I will.
Thank you. Excuse me now.

1610
01:52:45,811 --> 01:52:47,961
- Good evening, Dr. Humbert.
- Hi, Dad!

1611
01:52:47,847 --> 01:52:50,156
- Wasn't it wonderful?
- How did you like it?

1612
01:52:50,182 --> 01:52:52,298
There's a party for the cast and author.

1613
01:52:52,151 --> 01:52:54,870
- Everybody's invited.
- I must take Lolita home.

1614
01:52:55,321 --> 01:52:58,552
- Our starlet's had enough excitement.
- They all want to meet you!

1615
01:52:58,591 --> 01:53:01,230
I wouldn't want you to miss
any more piano lessons.

1616
01:53:01,193 --> 01:53:03,912
- I haven't missed any.
- You know what I'm talking about.

1617
01:53:03,863 --> 01:53:04,898
Say goodnight.

1618
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:07,485
This isn't a regular party, it's a cast party.

1619
01:53:07,466 --> 01:53:08,581
Come on.

1620
01:53:09,635 --> 01:53:12,627
- This is the cast party...
- We'll discuss it later.

1621
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:16,590
Brewster...

1622
01:53:17,443 --> 01:53:19,798
...go and get some Type "A" Kodachrome.

1623
01:53:20,145 --> 01:53:21,134
Okay.

1624
01:53:30,823 --> 01:53:32,814
- You're not going upstairs.
- Yes, I am!

1625
01:53:32,892 --> 01:53:34,564
- We must have a talk.
- Let go!

1626
01:53:34,526 --> 01:53:36,642
- You're hurting my arm!
- Stop shouting!

1627
01:53:36,528 --> 01:53:39,247
You let me go, you jerk! Let go of me!

1628
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:41,666
Sit down! Now you're going to answer
a few questions.

1629
01:53:41,667 --> 01:53:44,227
You've got a big, fat nerve
dragging me away.

1630
01:53:44,203 --> 01:53:46,876
- Stop that silly noise!
- Who do you think you are...

1631
01:53:46,839 --> 01:53:48,557
...not letting me go to the party?

1632
01:53:48,507 --> 01:53:51,897
- Stop that shouting.
- I don't care if the police do come in here.

1633
01:53:53,412 --> 01:53:55,926
All right, now the doors are shut.
Come on, shout!

1634
01:53:55,915 --> 01:53:58,634
Let's hear how loud you can shout.
Come on.

1635
01:54:03,923 --> 01:54:05,993
Now perhaps you will tell me.

1636
01:54:06,525 --> 01:54:10,598
What were you doing on Saturday
between 2:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon?

1637
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,883
I went to my piano lesson.

1638
01:54:12,898 --> 01:54:14,251
- That's a lie.
- It is not.

1639
01:54:14,266 --> 01:54:17,656
I happen to know you haven't been
to a piano lesson for four weeks.

1640
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:19,388
Yeah? Just ask Miss Starch.

1641
01:54:19,338 --> 01:54:21,568
I asked Miss Starch.
How do you think I know?

1642
01:54:21,607 --> 01:54:25,043
She told me. I saw her tonight.
Didn't you see her at the performance?

1643
01:54:25,177 --> 01:54:26,326
Yeah.

1644
01:54:26,545 --> 01:54:27,694
Now tell me.

1645
01:54:27,546 --> 01:54:30,014
What have you been doing
these afternoons?

1646
01:54:33,986 --> 01:54:36,978
- You really want to know?
- Yes, I do. I really want to know.

1647
01:54:37,222 --> 01:54:41,056
All right. I'm going to tell you
the real truth, what I've been doing.

1648
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,476
I've been going to extra rehearsals.

1649
01:54:43,362 --> 01:54:46,672
That's the most fatuous lie
you could possibly think up.

1650
01:54:46,699 --> 01:54:48,929
Don't say any more.
I know what you've been doing.

1651
01:54:48,968 --> 01:54:51,721
You've been with this leading man
of yours...

1652
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:53,661
...this Roy, isn't that so?

1653
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:56,697
You're sick.

1654
01:54:56,775 --> 01:54:59,608
Stop! Don't throw those silly,
silly cliches at me.

1655
01:54:59,545 --> 01:55:01,058
Don't tell me any more.

1656
01:55:01,213 --> 01:55:02,726
You've been with this boy?

1657
01:55:02,715 --> 01:55:04,865
- Come on, tell me.
- You need help.

1658
01:55:05,384 --> 01:55:09,059
- You're imagining things.
- Shut up, Lolita. Stop that silly talk.

1659
01:55:23,435 --> 01:55:24,424
Lolita.

1660
01:55:34,279 --> 01:55:38,158
Now, if you swear to me that this isn't true
I promise that I will believe you.

1661
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:41,686
I won't swear anything.
You'll never believe me, no matter what.

1662
01:55:41,653 --> 01:55:43,132
I will believe you.

1663
01:55:43,489 --> 01:55:45,480
No, you won't. You won't believe me.

1664
01:55:45,557 --> 01:55:48,788
I'll forget the whole thing.
I'll never question you about it again.

1665
01:55:48,827 --> 01:55:51,944
No, you'll never believe me.
Why should I swear to you?

1666
01:55:57,903 --> 01:55:59,814
All right, I believe you.

1667
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:01,791
It's partly my fault. I realize that.

1668
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:05,130
It's something that's happened
on account of this horrible place.

1669
01:56:05,411 --> 01:56:07,766
These people poking their noses
into our business...

1670
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:11,978
...and I never see you anymore,
with your soda fountains, and your extra...

1671
01:56:12,017 --> 01:56:13,575
Stop doing that!

1672
01:56:22,628 --> 01:56:24,903
But we could leave this place perhaps.

1673
01:56:27,633 --> 01:56:30,511
Yes, there's nothing to keep us here.

1674
01:56:31,403 --> 01:56:34,839
We haven't any obligations here.
We don't owe rent to anybody.

1675
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:38,833
We could just pack up our bags.
Tonight. We could go now.

1676
01:56:38,944 --> 01:56:42,061
I could take you for a wonderful trip
round the country.

1677
01:56:43,482 --> 01:56:44,995
You can't leave here.

1678
01:56:45,617 --> 01:56:46,606
Why not?

1679
01:56:46,919 --> 01:56:49,592
You've got to work. What about your job?

1680
01:56:49,655 --> 01:56:52,886
My job doesn't mean anything.
I could always publish articles...

1681
01:56:52,925 --> 01:56:56,395
My book's going to be published soon.
It's a wonderful idea.

1682
01:56:56,995 --> 01:56:59,873
I have to go to school.
What about my education?

1683
01:56:59,832 --> 01:57:03,108
What sort of an education
do you think you're getting here?

1684
01:57:03,502 --> 01:57:07,620
You got a much better education
when you were travelling around with me.

1685
01:57:07,973 --> 01:57:10,806
Well, the play has two more performances
next week.

1686
01:57:10,742 --> 01:57:14,496
Don't start talking about the play.
That's what's just come between us.

1687
01:57:14,446 --> 01:57:16,596
That's what started this whole row.

1688
01:57:17,883 --> 01:57:20,192
Don't you want to get back
to where we were...

1689
01:57:20,385 --> 01:57:22,501
...before we came to this horrible place?

1690
01:57:22,554 --> 01:57:24,749
Don't you want to come away with me?

1691
01:57:25,023 --> 01:57:26,012
No!

1692
01:57:26,358 --> 01:57:27,837
I hate you!

1693
01:57:27,926 --> 01:57:29,564
I hate you!

1694
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,878
You want to stay with this filthy boy!

1695
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:32,965
Yes!

1696
01:57:33,365 --> 01:57:35,595
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- Shut your mouth...

1697
01:57:35,634 --> 01:57:38,512
...you horrid little psychopath!
- Let me go, you creep!

1698
01:57:38,437 --> 01:57:40,234
I promise you one thing:

1699
01:57:40,172 --> 01:57:42,640
You're not going to see
these filthy boys anymore.

1700
01:57:42,641 --> 01:57:45,109
- That's one thing that...
- I've got news for you.

1701
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:48,102
I'll do anything I want to,
anytime I want to...

1702
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:50,569
...with anyone I want...
- Shut your filthy mouth!

1703
01:57:50,582 --> 01:57:52,698
...and you can't stop me!
- Shut up!

1704
01:58:00,425 --> 01:58:03,064
- Miss Le Bone.
- Dr. Humbert, may I come in?

1705
01:58:03,929 --> 01:58:05,681
What can I do for you?

1706
01:58:05,731 --> 01:58:08,564
This is a little awkward to say, but I'm...

1707
01:58:08,767 --> 01:58:12,919
I thought you ought to know, this noise,
I can hear every word next door.

1708
01:58:12,971 --> 01:58:15,121
Well, we were having a family row.

1709
01:58:15,174 --> 01:58:18,052
The child's voice is very shrill
when she gets upset.

1710
01:58:17,976 --> 01:58:21,252
Yes, of course, I understand perfectly,
but, well, I...

1711
01:58:21,446 --> 01:58:25,519
I happen to have company and he's
a minister of the church, and you know...

1712
01:58:25,684 --> 01:58:27,959
Perhaps you can convey
my apologies to him.

1713
01:58:27,953 --> 01:58:29,989
We were quarrelling about piano lessons.

1714
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,037
Hello, dear!

1715
01:58:31,423 --> 01:58:32,902
Hello, Miss Le Bone.

1716
01:58:33,959 --> 01:58:35,074
Goodnight!

1717
01:58:36,094 --> 01:58:39,609
- What a pretty getup!
- She was in the school play tonight.

1718
01:58:39,598 --> 01:58:42,066
Yes, of course, the school play.

1719
01:58:43,001 --> 01:58:44,719
Dr. Humbert, I do hope...

1720
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:48,948
...you don't think that I'm presuming
on our good neighbor relations, but...

1721
01:58:49,074 --> 01:58:52,111
...I should tell you
that the neighbors are beginning...

1722
01:58:51,977 --> 01:58:54,650
...to get curious about you and your girl.

1723
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:58,832
- I can't think why they should do that.
- Well, you know how people talk.

1724
01:59:01,186 --> 01:59:03,177
I must get back to my guest.

1725
01:59:03,689 --> 01:59:05,202
Would you care to join us?

1726
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:08,660
That's very nice of you, thank you,
but I'll take a rain check on it.

1727
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:10,730
Oh, right.

1728
01:59:10,796 --> 01:59:12,195
Well, goodnight!

1729
01:59:12,664 --> 01:59:13,813
Goodnight.

1730
01:59:32,017 --> 01:59:33,769
Come on, we're going home.

1731
01:59:33,785 --> 01:59:35,821
- Wait.
- I forbade you to go to the party.

1732
01:59:35,887 --> 01:59:36,956
I wasn't going to.

1733
01:59:36,989 --> 01:59:39,105
- Who were you talking to?
- I tried to call you.

1734
01:59:39,157 --> 01:59:43,036
You were speaking to somebody just now
on the telephone. Who was that?

1735
01:59:43,095 --> 01:59:44,813
I got a wrong number.

1736
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:48,522
Listen, I've decided something.

1737
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,749
Yes?

1738
01:59:50,068 --> 01:59:51,899
I want to leave school.

1739
01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:53,159
You what?

1740
01:59:53,238 --> 01:59:55,308
I don't want you to be mad at me anymore.

1741
01:59:55,507 --> 01:59:57,737
Everything's going to be great
from now on.

1742
01:59:57,776 --> 02:00:00,813
- You mean that?
- I hate school, and I hate the play...

1743
02:00:01,146 --> 02:00:03,785
...I really do. I never want to go back.

1744
02:00:04,016 --> 02:00:05,165
That's good.

1745
02:00:05,684 --> 02:00:08,198
Let's leave tomorrow.
We can go for a long trip...

1746
02:00:08,186 --> 02:00:10,984
...and we'll go wherever I want to,
won't we?

1747
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:13,118
Yes, my darling.

1748
02:00:13,158 --> 02:00:15,353
- Are you glad?
- Yes, of course I am.

1749
02:00:15,527 --> 02:00:17,597
To hell with the play! See what I mean?

1750
02:00:17,663 --> 02:00:19,096
Yes, that's good!

1751
02:00:19,765 --> 02:00:22,962
Let's go home. I feel sort of romantic.

1752
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:34,861
The brakes were relined,
the water pipes unplugged...

1753
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,698
...the valves ground.

1754
02:00:36,882 --> 02:00:39,954
We had promised Beardsley School
that we would be back...

1755
02:00:39,851 --> 02:00:43,207
...as soon as my Hollywood engagement
came to an end.

1756
02:00:44,089 --> 02:00:49,117
Inventive Humbert was to be, I hinted,
chief consultant in production of a film...

1757
02:00:49,027 --> 02:00:53,145
...dealing with existentialism,
still a hot thing at the time.

1758
02:01:47,018 --> 02:01:51,375
I cannot tell you the exact day
when I first knew with utter certainty...

1759
02:01:51,723 --> 02:01:54,191
...that a strange car was following us.

1760
02:01:55,026 --> 02:01:58,302
Queer how I misinterpreted
the designation of doom.

1761
02:02:20,352 --> 02:02:22,024
Fill her up, please.

1762
02:03:06,465 --> 02:03:09,025
I'm cold, I'm going to get a sweater.

1763
02:03:09,234 --> 02:03:10,269
Watch it, please!

1764
02:03:10,335 --> 02:03:13,884
Do you have to drive so fast?
You'll get us killed!

1765
02:03:14,473 --> 02:03:16,782
What's the big, fat hurry, anyway?

1766
02:03:17,108 --> 02:03:20,817
There's been a car following us
which we've been trying to lose.

1767
02:03:20,812 --> 02:03:24,043
However, I haven't seen it recently.
I think we've lost it.

1768
02:03:24,049 --> 02:03:25,198
Really?

1769
02:03:25,283 --> 02:03:28,434
I didn't want to scare you,
but it's followed us for three days...

1770
02:03:28,487 --> 02:03:31,160
...and yesterday it was parked
outside the motel.

1771
02:03:31,122 --> 02:03:34,239
- I haven't seen any car. Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

1772
02:03:34,292 --> 02:03:36,283
I think you're imagining things.

1773
02:03:36,194 --> 02:03:38,947
What did that man ask you
in the service station?

1774
02:03:38,897 --> 02:03:39,966
What man?

1775
02:03:39,865 --> 02:03:43,619
There was a man in the service station.
I saw you when I was in the john.

1776
02:03:43,735 --> 02:03:46,727
I didn't see any man at the...
Oh, yes, that man.

1777
02:03:47,405 --> 02:03:50,283
He wondered if I had a map.
I guess he got lost.

1778
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:52,403
Lo, now listen, please.

1779
02:03:52,744 --> 02:03:55,736
I don't know if you're lying to me,
or if you're insane...

1780
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,852
...and I don't really care any longer,
but that man, I believe...

1781
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:01,112
...was in the car that's been following us.

1782
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:03,189
- That's ridiculous.
- I think he's a cop.

1783
02:04:03,255 --> 02:04:04,483
- A cop?
- Yes.

1784
02:04:04,523 --> 02:04:07,879
If he is, the worst thing we can do
is let him know we're scared.

1785
02:04:07,893 --> 02:04:09,929
Let's just ignore him, and slow down.

1786
02:04:09,995 --> 02:04:12,190
Would you kindly tell me, please...

1787
02:04:12,264 --> 02:04:15,336
...what you said to him exactly
and what he said to you?

1788
02:04:15,233 --> 02:04:16,552
I told you.

1789
02:04:16,835 --> 02:04:19,395
Did he ask you where we were going?

1790
02:04:19,471 --> 02:04:21,905
All he asked was if I had a map.

1791
02:04:22,073 --> 02:04:25,224
I'd have thought that he'd ask
the man at the service station.

1792
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:27,260
I would have thought he would, too.

1793
02:04:28,146 --> 02:04:30,376
Well, anyhow, I think we've lost him.

1794
02:04:34,519 --> 02:04:36,510
I told you not to drive so fast!

1795
02:04:36,421 --> 02:04:37,854
Leave me alone!

1796
02:04:37,822 --> 02:04:41,656
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Do you think I wanted to have a blow out?

1797
02:04:42,827 --> 02:04:45,864
Hey, look, all the nines changed
to the next thousand.

1798
02:04:46,298 --> 02:04:47,333
There it is.

1799
02:04:47,399 --> 02:04:48,548
What?

1800
02:04:48,433 --> 02:04:50,867
The car. Don't you recognize it now?

1801
02:04:50,869 --> 02:04:51,984
No.

1802
02:04:51,836 --> 02:04:53,030
Don't look now.

1803
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:55,710
I don't want him to think
that we've seen him.

1804
02:04:58,843 --> 02:05:01,880
- What's he stopping for?
- Maybe he's going to help us.

1805
02:05:01,947 --> 02:05:04,984
He can't help us,
stopping way back there like that.

1806
02:05:05,917 --> 02:05:10,672
It can't be the police because if they were,
they'd pull up beside us and write a ticket.

1807
02:05:10,922 --> 02:05:13,117
- But the police...
- I am trying to think.

1808
02:05:13,158 --> 02:05:18,471
Maybe it's a special kind of police
who are just supposed to follow people.

1809
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:22,181
Yeah, like the vice squad! Scaddy, wow!

1810
02:05:22,067 --> 02:05:25,139
Be quiet! Stop talking!
We've got to think about this.

1811
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:27,447
What are we going to do?

1812
02:05:27,606 --> 02:05:29,483
Am I being quiet enough?

1813
02:05:29,474 --> 02:05:33,387
Don't try to be clever, please.
I've got a terrific pain in my arm.

1814
02:05:33,445 --> 02:05:36,005
- Really?
- I don't know what I did to it.

1815
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:40,586
What are we going to do now?

1816
02:05:40,485 --> 02:05:42,635
I'm going to get out of this car...

1817
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:45,273
...walk down the road
and speak to him face to face.

1818
02:05:45,223 --> 02:05:47,134
I'll say, "What are you doing?"

1819
02:05:47,058 --> 02:05:49,174
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

1820
02:05:49,194 --> 02:05:51,344
Well, it might be dangerous.

1821
02:05:56,267 --> 02:05:57,985
My arm is killing me.

1822
02:05:59,104 --> 02:06:03,097
I don't seem to be able to breathe properly.

1823
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:05,691
It's probably just gas pains.

1824
02:06:07,245 --> 02:06:08,997
Yes, it must be that.

1825
02:06:09,581 --> 02:06:12,573
Maybe you ought to see a doctor
in the next town?

1826
02:06:13,251 --> 02:06:15,128
No, I'll be all right.

1827
02:06:17,989 --> 02:06:21,061
It's probably just something I ate.

1828
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,052
Wait a minute.

1829
02:06:24,462 --> 02:06:28,375
I once read in a Reader's Digest
that this is the way heart attacks start.

1830
02:06:28,266 --> 02:06:29,619
Shut up, will you?

1831
02:06:29,934 --> 02:06:31,526
Shut up yourself!

1832
02:06:31,636 --> 02:06:34,230
I'm tired of hearing
about your moans and groans.

1833
02:06:34,205 --> 02:06:37,436
If you want to know something,
I feel pretty lousy myself.

1834
02:06:43,515 --> 02:06:44,630
He's moving.

1835
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:46,599
Big deal!

1836
02:06:48,119 --> 02:06:49,598
He's turning around.

1837
02:06:55,727 --> 02:06:57,285
He's going away.

1838
02:07:02,434 --> 02:07:04,152
Are you feeling cold?

1839
02:07:04,502 --> 02:07:05,491
Yeah.

1840
02:07:06,271 --> 02:07:07,829
I feel all achy.

1841
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:11,290
I bet I'm getting the Asiatic flu.

1842
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:14,665
Here, let me feel your head.

1843
02:07:20,085 --> 02:07:22,201
We make a fine pair, don't we?

1844
02:07:23,521 --> 02:07:28,675
You just relax and stretch out on the seat,
if that will make you feel better...

1845
02:07:30,195 --> 02:07:32,470
...and I'll see what I can do about...

1846
02:07:34,132 --> 02:07:35,645
...changing the tire.

1847
02:07:50,582 --> 02:07:51,617
Good morning.

1848
02:07:51,683 --> 02:07:53,594
Good morning, Mr. Humbert.

1849
02:07:55,587 --> 02:07:59,057
Good morning, Mr. Humbert.
We seem to be going the same way.

1850
02:07:59,023 --> 02:08:02,095
I was just about to give your daughter
some medicine.

1851
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:04,230
- How is she?
- She's much better today.

1852
02:08:04,295 --> 02:08:07,367
Her temperature's normal
and her cough's gone.

1853
02:08:07,365 --> 02:08:08,798
Here's your father, dear.

1854
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,119
- Hi!
- Hello.

1855
02:08:13,037 --> 02:08:15,187
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

1856
02:08:15,406 --> 02:08:17,397
You're looking much better.

1857
02:08:21,546 --> 02:08:23,582
What gruesome flowers.

1858
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:26,724
But thanks, anyway.

1859
02:08:26,751 --> 02:08:29,743
Nurse, can you find some water
to put these in, please?

1860
02:08:29,654 --> 02:08:30,769
Certainly.

1861
02:08:30,655 --> 02:08:32,850
Have you been getting notes
in the hospital?

1862
02:08:33,057 --> 02:08:34,376
Excuse me.

1863
02:08:34,692 --> 02:08:38,287
Does your father think that you get notes
from my boyfriend?

1864
02:08:43,034 --> 02:08:46,344
I just thought it might be a bill
from the hospital or something.

1865
02:08:46,371 --> 02:08:50,808
- Do you have to antagonize everybody?
- It was a perfectly reasonable question.

1866
02:08:53,044 --> 02:08:55,877
What's the matter with you anyway?
You look kind of slimy.

1867
02:08:55,814 --> 02:08:58,374
I'm afraid I'm coming down with a cold.

1868
02:08:59,684 --> 02:09:01,242
Caught it from me?

1869
02:09:01,219 --> 02:09:02,288
I suppose.

1870
02:09:02,353 --> 02:09:05,948
Mr. Humbert, would you please
move your car to the visitor's parking lot?

1871
02:09:06,057 --> 02:09:09,015
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry
and I didn't feel too bright.

1872
02:09:09,093 --> 02:09:12,085
But you've parked it right next to a sign
saying "Staff Only."

1873
02:09:12,163 --> 02:09:14,154
All right. I shall leave in a moment.

1874
02:09:14,232 --> 02:09:16,792
I'm sorry, but these are the hospital rules.

1875
02:09:20,104 --> 02:09:22,254
Mary was only trying to be helpful.

1876
02:09:22,106 --> 02:09:25,223
I've no doubt she's been just as helpful
with you all the time.

1877
02:09:25,243 --> 02:09:26,232
She has.

1878
02:09:26,711 --> 02:09:30,704
And I shouldn't wonder if you two
have been exchanging confessions.

1879
02:09:30,615 --> 02:09:33,527
Come on now,
let's not start that all up again.

1880
02:09:36,588 --> 02:09:38,499
I brought you some books.

1881
02:09:39,557 --> 02:09:42,469
My friend, Professor Baer,
The Romantic Poets...

1882
02:09:42,594 --> 02:09:46,189
...and here's something you might like,
The History of Dancing, and...

1883
02:09:46,164 --> 02:09:50,601
...A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
by James Joyce, you might like.

1884
02:09:51,102 --> 02:09:54,299
- Whose are these? These are not yours.
- Those are Mary's.

1885
02:09:54,405 --> 02:09:58,637
And since when have nurses
worn dark glasses when on duty?

1886
02:10:00,411 --> 02:10:02,242
There we go again!

1887
02:10:04,749 --> 02:10:07,786
When did the doctor say
that you can leave the hospital?

1888
02:10:07,652 --> 02:10:08,641
What?

1889
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:11,793
Are you going to read the magazine
or talk to me?

1890
02:10:11,756 --> 02:10:12,905
Sure.

1891
02:10:13,324 --> 02:10:15,599
When did the doctor say
that you can leave?

1892
02:10:15,627 --> 02:10:18,380
I think he wants me to stay
another 48 hours.

1893
02:10:18,329 --> 02:10:21,321
That's all right. We can start early
on Tuesday morning...

1894
02:10:21,232 --> 02:10:24,542
...and we'll make the Mexican border
in three days, and...

1895
02:10:25,136 --> 02:10:28,685
...that'll be the end of all those
mysterious agents following us around.

1896
02:10:28,673 --> 02:10:31,585
Mr. Humbert, I must ask you
to move your car.

1897
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:33,963
I'm just leaving.

1898
02:10:38,583 --> 02:10:39,572
Goodbye.

1899
02:10:44,188 --> 02:10:45,780
Might catch your cold.

1900
02:10:50,561 --> 02:10:53,394
I shall stay in tonight and nurse my cold...

1901
02:10:53,765 --> 02:10:56,598
...so I shan't see you
until tomorrow morning.

1902
02:10:56,701 --> 02:10:57,690
Bye-bye.

1903
02:11:48,553 --> 02:11:49,702
Hello?

1904
02:11:49,854 --> 02:11:51,970
Hello. Is that Professor Humbert?

1905
02:11:53,024 --> 02:11:54,173
Yes.

1906
02:11:54,392 --> 02:11:55,984
How are you, Professor?

1907
02:11:56,894 --> 02:11:59,010
I'm... Who is this, please?

1908
02:11:59,998 --> 02:12:03,274
I'm sort of really sorry to disturb you.

1909
02:12:03,301 --> 02:12:06,657
I hope I really haven't woken you
at this terribly late hour.

1910
02:12:06,904 --> 02:12:09,418
I was wondering if you'd been
enjoying your stay...

1911
02:12:09,407 --> 02:12:11,523
...in our lovely little town here.

1912
02:12:11,909 --> 02:12:13,058
Who's this calling?

1913
02:12:13,244 --> 02:12:15,519
My name... It doesn't really matter.

1914
02:12:15,546 --> 02:12:18,379
It's really an obscure
and unremarkable name...

1915
02:12:18,316 --> 02:12:19,908
...you understand, Professor.

1916
02:12:19,884 --> 02:12:25,038
But my department is sort of concerned,
sort of concerned with the bizarre...

1917
02:12:24,956 --> 02:12:29,666
...rumors that have been circulating
about you and the lovely, remarkable girl...

1918
02:12:29,627 --> 02:12:31,504
...you've been travelling with.

1919
02:12:31,429 --> 02:12:34,580
Look, I'm very much afraid
you'll have to identify yourself...

1920
02:12:34,465 --> 02:12:38,583
...because this conversation is becoming
more and more preposterous.

1921
02:12:38,469 --> 02:12:41,108
Professor, now tell me something...

1922
02:12:41,072 --> 02:12:43,825
...I guess all this travelling around you do...

1923
02:12:43,775 --> 02:12:47,131
...you don't get much time
to see a psychiatrist regularly...

1924
02:12:47,278 --> 02:12:48,597
...is that right?

1925
02:12:48,613 --> 02:12:52,447
I have no psychiatrist,
and I don't need a psychiatrist!

1926
02:12:52,483 --> 02:12:54,553
I'll tell you why I ask, you see...

1927
02:12:54,619 --> 02:12:58,453
...you're classified in our files, Professor...

1928
02:12:58,389 --> 02:13:01,540
...you're classified in our files
as a white, widowed male.

1929
02:13:01,426 --> 02:13:04,623
I wonder if you'd be prepared
to give our investigators...

1930
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:07,990
...a report, Professor, on your...

1931
02:13:08,499 --> 02:13:10,729
...current sex life, if any.

1932
02:13:10,835 --> 02:13:13,952
I don't know who you are,
and I certainly have no interest...

1933
02:13:13,971 --> 02:13:17,088
...in your investigators
so I'm afraid that you will have to...

1934
02:13:17,308 --> 02:13:19,264
...terminate this conversation.

1935
02:13:19,343 --> 02:13:22,096
Professor, "afraid"is Freudian lingo...

1936
02:13:41,866 --> 02:13:44,460
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes. My name is Humbert.

1937
02:13:44,435 --> 02:13:47,825
I want to pay the bill of Miss Haze
in Room 3. I'm taking her home.

1938
02:13:47,839 --> 02:13:49,989
Have you gotten permission
from the doctor?

1939
02:13:50,041 --> 02:13:53,113
I can do what I choose.
It's nothing to do with the doctor.

1940
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:55,080
You must have permission from the doctor.

1941
02:13:55,146 --> 02:13:57,421
What is this, a prison or a hospital?

1942
02:13:57,548 --> 02:14:00,506
I'm afraid you'll have to speak
to Dr. Keagy.

1943
02:14:01,385 --> 02:14:04,934
Calling Dr. Keagy.
Dr. Keagy, come to Reception please.

1944
02:14:04,922 --> 02:14:06,992
I'll just go into her room to alert her.

1945
02:14:06,858 --> 02:14:08,769
No, you can't go in there.

1946
02:14:08,693 --> 02:14:10,968
I'll get her to get her bags ready.

1947
02:14:11,028 --> 02:14:14,498
Dr. Keagy will be down in just a minute.
Why don't you wait?

1948
02:14:19,704 --> 02:14:22,582
- Yes, Miss Fromkiss?
- Dr. Keagy, Mr. Humbert.

1949
02:14:23,074 --> 02:14:25,190
How long have you had that cough,
Mr. Humbert?

1950
02:14:25,409 --> 02:14:28,242
I'm all right, thank you.
I simply want to pay the bill...

1951
02:14:28,179 --> 02:14:31,615
...for Miss Haze in Room 3
and take her away from here.

1952
02:14:31,616 --> 02:14:33,652
Miss Haze, Room 3.

1953
02:14:33,718 --> 02:14:36,107
Wasn't she discharged earlier this evening?

1954
02:14:36,087 --> 02:14:38,601
- I'll see.
- No, she couldn't have been.

1955
02:14:39,724 --> 02:14:42,158
Yes, she was discharged
at 8:15 this evening.

1956
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:43,593
That's impossible.

1957
02:14:43,561 --> 02:14:46,678
- Right here, she was discharged at 8:15.
- I don't care about that.

1958
02:14:46,731 --> 02:14:50,246
You, Nurse, what's your name?
She's still in there, isn't she?

1959
02:14:50,401 --> 02:14:52,915
Mr. Humbert, your daughter left
earlier this evening.

1960
02:14:52,904 --> 02:14:54,257
That's ridiculous.

1961
02:14:54,438 --> 02:14:55,791
Where are you going?

1962
02:14:55,806 --> 02:14:57,080
Come back here, now.

1963
02:14:57,074 --> 02:14:59,986
You can't go in there now, it's a hospital.

1964
02:14:59,944 --> 02:15:02,219
- Where have you put her?
- Get your hands off her!

1965
02:15:02,413 --> 02:15:03,641
Where is she?

1966
02:15:04,582 --> 02:15:06,573
Hold him! Hold him!

1967
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:07,979
Let go of me!

1968
02:15:08,052 --> 02:15:10,805
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hold it!

1969
02:15:10,788 --> 02:15:11,937
Where is she?

1970
02:15:11,789 --> 02:15:14,019
- Easy, now.
- Sidney, get a straightjacket.

1971
02:15:14,058 --> 02:15:15,696
All right. I'm calm.

1972
02:15:15,626 --> 02:15:17,776
Doctor, this man must be psychotic.

1973
02:15:17,929 --> 02:15:19,885
His stepdaughter was a patient...

1974
02:15:19,797 --> 02:15:22,630
...and she left this evening
in care of her uncle.

1975
02:15:22,567 --> 02:15:24,922
- Her uncle! Did you say "uncle"?
- Yes.

1976
02:15:24,936 --> 02:15:26,927
- Let me go!
- Hold him!

1977
02:15:32,743 --> 02:15:34,654
Hold him now. Got him, Andre?

1978
02:15:34,579 --> 02:15:35,898
Yeah!

1979
02:15:35,947 --> 02:15:38,017
All right. Let me go.

1980
02:15:37,949 --> 02:15:39,667
Now look, mister...

1981
02:15:39,984 --> 02:15:43,135
...you've caused quite
a serious disturbance here. Now, hold it!

1982
02:15:43,187 --> 02:15:45,064
If you like, we'll call the police.

1983
02:15:44,989 --> 02:15:49,028
The police! No. We don't need the police.
It's quite all right.

1984
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:51,933
Let's get this business straight.

1985
02:15:53,064 --> 02:15:56,898
This girl was officially discharged
earlier tonight in the care of her uncle.

1986
02:15:56,834 --> 02:15:58,313
If you say so.

1987
02:15:58,502 --> 02:16:00,493
Has she or hasn't she an uncle?

1988
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:02,748
All right, let's say she has an uncle.

1989
02:16:02,673 --> 02:16:05,392
What do you mean,
"let's say she has an uncle"?

1990
02:16:05,943 --> 02:16:07,820
All right, she has an uncle.

1991
02:16:07,745 --> 02:16:10,782
Uncle Gus, yes, I remember now...

1992
02:16:10,915 --> 02:16:15,033
...he was going to pick her up here
at the hospital. I forgot that.

1993
02:16:15,553 --> 02:16:17,191
- You forgot?
- Yes, I forgot!

1994
02:16:17,154 --> 02:16:19,907
- It's a strange thing to forget.
- No, it's not so strange.

1995
02:16:19,857 --> 02:16:23,167
You don't know my brother Gus.
He's very easy to forget.

1996
02:16:23,694 --> 02:16:25,844
He's drunk, that's what's the matter.

1997
02:16:25,730 --> 02:16:27,880
That's right, I've been drinking too much.

1998
02:16:27,765 --> 02:16:29,756
I have personal problems, you understand?

1999
02:16:29,834 --> 02:16:32,792
- Here it is, Doctor.
- No, it's all right, Sidney.

2000
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:44,234
Would you like some black coffee
or something?

2001
02:16:44,248 --> 02:16:48,002
No, not now, thank you.
I really ought to move on now.

2002
02:16:48,586 --> 02:16:50,736
Think you feel well enough to leave?

2003
02:16:50,588 --> 02:16:54,263
Yes. Just let me up, I'm fine now,
much better.

2004
02:16:54,292 --> 02:16:56,123
See that he gets home all right.

2005
02:16:56,060 --> 02:16:57,857
All right, let him up.

2006
02:17:04,135 --> 02:17:08,208
She didn't, by any chance,
leave any message for me?

2007
02:17:09,807 --> 02:17:11,684
No. I suppose not.

2008
02:20:06,884 --> 02:20:08,033
Well...

2009
02:20:08,786 --> 02:20:10,504
...gee, what a surprise!

2010
02:20:13,157 --> 02:20:16,354
So, this is what Mrs. Richard T. Schiller
looks like!

2011
02:20:17,728 --> 02:20:21,721
You'll have to excuse my appearance,
but you've caught me on ironing day.

2012
02:20:24,268 --> 02:20:25,587
But do come in.

2013
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:29,330
You're looking marvelous!
Can I take your coat?

2014
02:20:29,306 --> 02:20:31,376
No, I'd rather keep it.

2015
02:20:32,276 --> 02:20:34,346
I wrote to you about a week ago.

2016
02:20:34,411 --> 02:20:37,209
I was beginning to think
you were sore or something.

2017
02:20:37,147 --> 02:20:39,866
I must say I wouldn't blame you
if you were.

2018
02:20:40,284 --> 02:20:42,593
A fine thing me dropping out of sight
for so long...

2019
02:20:42,786 --> 02:20:44,822
...and then writing you for a handout.

2020
02:20:44,889 --> 02:20:47,357
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you...

2021
02:20:47,358 --> 02:20:48,950
Or a drink, maybe?

2022
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:50,449
No.

2023
02:20:51,996 --> 02:20:54,112
I won't be able to do that
in another month.

2024
02:20:53,998 --> 02:20:55,147
Is that him?

2025
02:20:55,966 --> 02:20:57,115
The one facing us.

2026
02:20:57,167 --> 02:20:58,520
Yes, that's Dick.

2027
02:21:00,304 --> 02:21:02,454
He doesn't know a thing
about you and me...

2028
02:21:02,506 --> 02:21:04,383
...so please watch what you say.

2029
02:21:04,275 --> 02:21:07,426
That's ridiculous! You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

2030
02:21:07,478 --> 02:21:10,390
Why not? You don't think I'd tell him,
do you?

2031
02:21:10,915 --> 02:21:12,712
Who does he think that I am?

2032
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:14,424
My stepfather!

2033
02:21:19,256 --> 02:21:22,328
Then this isn't the man who took you
from the hospital?

2034
02:21:22,226 --> 02:21:23,579
No, of course not!

2035
02:21:25,529 --> 02:21:27,565
How long have you known him?

2036
02:21:27,464 --> 02:21:31,218
About a year. I met him in Phoenix.
I was working as a waitress.

2037
02:21:32,303 --> 02:21:34,453
Who is the man that I'm looking for?

2038
02:21:34,805 --> 02:21:38,036
There's no point in going into that.
It's all over.

2039
02:21:38,309 --> 02:21:40,140
Lolita, I have to know.

2040
02:21:40,811 --> 02:21:42,802
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

2041
02:21:44,415 --> 02:21:47,213
Lolita, I have a perfect right to know this.

2042
02:21:47,585 --> 02:21:50,383
Crimeny! I should never
have written to you.

2043
02:21:51,822 --> 02:21:54,575
You wouldn't have written
if you hadn't needed the money.

2044
02:21:54,525 --> 02:21:57,358
Now, if you're a sensible girl,
and if you want...

2045
02:21:57,294 --> 02:22:01,082
...what I've come to give you,
you'll tell me what I want to know.

2046
02:22:06,971 --> 02:22:08,689
Do you remember Dr. Zemph?

2047
02:22:09,607 --> 02:22:11,006
Dr. Zemph?

2048
02:22:11,609 --> 02:22:15,045
That German psychologist
that came to see you at Beardsley.

2049
02:22:16,013 --> 02:22:17,162
Was it him?

2050
02:22:17,581 --> 02:22:18,900
Not exactly.

2051
02:22:18,916 --> 02:22:21,510
I didn't come here to play guessing games.

2052
02:22:21,885 --> 02:22:23,204
Tell me who it was.

2053
02:22:23,187 --> 02:22:25,257
Well, give me a chance to explain.

2054
02:22:25,155 --> 02:22:26,224
All right.

2055
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:30,383
Do you remember that car
that used to follow us around?

2056
02:22:30,294 --> 02:22:32,728
I'm not likely to forget that in a hurry.

2057
02:22:34,331 --> 02:22:37,323
Do you remember Mother's old flame
at the school dance?

2058
02:22:37,368 --> 02:22:39,962
No, you probably wouldn't remember him.

2059
02:22:41,071 --> 02:22:45,144
You remember the guy that you talked to
at that hotel on the way back from camp?

2060
02:22:45,209 --> 02:22:48,246
He pretended he was part
of that police convention.

2061
02:22:48,278 --> 02:22:49,757
Vaguely, yes.

2062
02:22:52,383 --> 02:22:55,375
Do you remember that guy
who called you at the motel?

2063
02:22:55,653 --> 02:22:57,564
The night you disappeared?

2064
02:22:58,122 --> 02:23:00,272
Yes, I remember him very well.

2065
02:23:00,691 --> 02:23:03,046
And yet, you still haven't guessed?

2066
02:23:04,028 --> 02:23:06,701
I told you that I'm not
playing games with you.

2067
02:23:07,464 --> 02:23:09,136
Tell me who it was.

2068
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:11,691
It was Clare Quilty.

2069
02:23:13,237 --> 02:23:14,795
Who was Clare Quilty?

2070
02:23:15,172 --> 02:23:17,083
All of them, of course.

2071
02:23:17,675 --> 02:23:20,348
You mean, Dr. Zemph, he was Clare Quilty?

2072
02:23:20,444 --> 02:23:22,560
Well, congratulations.

2073
02:23:23,113 --> 02:23:27,106
I don't suppose it ever occurred to you
that when you moved into our house...

2074
02:23:27,184 --> 02:23:29,823
...my whole world didn't revolve
around you.

2075
02:23:31,188 --> 02:23:33,543
I'd had a crush on him
ever since the times...

2076
02:23:33,557 --> 02:23:35,707
...that he used to come and visit Mother.

2077
02:23:35,926 --> 02:23:37,644
He wasn't like you and me.

2078
02:23:38,295 --> 02:23:40,251
He wasn't a normal person.

2079
02:23:40,964 --> 02:23:42,522
He was a genius.

2080
02:23:43,434 --> 02:23:45,106
He had a kind of...

2081
02:23:45,269 --> 02:23:49,626
...beautiful Japanese oriental philosophy
of life.

2082
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:53,776
You know that hotel we stopped at
on the way back from camp?

2083
02:23:53,944 --> 02:23:56,856
It was just by accident
that he was staying there...

2084
02:23:56,947 --> 02:24:00,417
...but it didn't take him long to figure out
what was going on between us.

2085
02:24:00,417 --> 02:24:03,693
From that moment on he was up
to every trick he could think of.

2086
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:07,714
And he did all these brilliant tricks
for the sheer fun of tormenting me?

2087
02:24:07,624 --> 02:24:11,583
Well, sometimes he had to,
like the German psychologist bit.

2088
02:24:12,296 --> 02:24:15,447
He had to trick you into letting me
be in his play...

2089
02:24:15,299 --> 02:24:17,415
...otherwise how would I ever see him?

2090
02:24:17,468 --> 02:24:19,743
So that's why you wanted
to be in the play?

2091
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:20,998
That's right.

2092
02:24:21,038 --> 02:24:23,506
The times you were
supposed to be practicing the piano...

2093
02:24:23,474 --> 02:24:25,465
...you were actually with this man?

2094
02:24:26,577 --> 02:24:29,808
I guess he was the only guy
I was ever really crazy about.

2095
02:24:32,082 --> 02:24:34,152
Aren't you forgetting something?

2096
02:24:35,586 --> 02:24:37,224
Oh, Dick.

2097
02:24:38,088 --> 02:24:39,567
Dick's very sweet...

2098
02:24:40,224 --> 02:24:42,374
...and we're very happy together...

2099
02:24:42,226 --> 02:24:44,820
...but I guess it's just not the same thing.

2100
02:24:46,096 --> 02:24:48,815
And I? I suppose I never counted,
of course.

2101
02:24:49,433 --> 02:24:53,711
You have no right to say that.
After all, the past is the past.

2102
02:24:58,008 --> 02:25:01,398
What happened to
this Oriental-minded genius?

2103
02:25:01,378 --> 02:25:05,451
Look, don't make fun of me.
I don't have to tell you a blasted thing.

2104
02:25:05,516 --> 02:25:07,108
I'm not making fun of you.

2105
02:25:07,050 --> 02:25:09,484
I'm merely trying to find out
what happened.

2106
02:25:09,486 --> 02:25:12,284
When you left the hospital,
where did he take you?

2107
02:25:12,189 --> 02:25:13,304
To New Mexico.

2108
02:25:13,357 --> 02:25:15,154
Whereabouts in New Mexico?

2109
02:25:15,092 --> 02:25:17,083
To a dude ranch near Santa Fe.

2110
02:25:17,528 --> 02:25:21,567
The only problem with it was,
he had a bunch of weird friends there.

2111
02:25:21,565 --> 02:25:23,556
What kind of weird friends?

2112
02:25:23,634 --> 02:25:24,783
Weird...

2113
02:25:24,668 --> 02:25:28,217
...painters, nudists,
writers, weight-lifters...

2114
02:25:28,405 --> 02:25:30,919
I figured I could take anything
for a few weeks...

2115
02:25:31,074 --> 02:25:33,383
...'cause I loved him.
He was going to Hollywood...

2116
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:35,446
...to write one of those spectaculars...

2117
02:25:35,512 --> 02:25:38,504
...and he promised to get me
a studio contract...

2118
02:25:38,448 --> 02:25:40,359
...but it never turned out that way.

2119
02:25:40,284 --> 02:25:42,673
Instead he wanted me
to cooperate with the others...

2120
02:25:42,686 --> 02:25:45,758
...in making some kind of a...
You know, an art movie.

2121
02:25:46,723 --> 02:25:48,361
An art movie!

2122
02:25:49,259 --> 02:25:50,248
Yeah.

2123
02:25:50,828 --> 02:25:52,386
And you did it?

2124
02:25:52,429 --> 02:25:54,579
No, I didn't do it.

2125
02:25:55,299 --> 02:25:56,812
So he kicked me out.

2126
02:25:58,569 --> 02:26:00,719
You could have come back to me.

2127
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:10,542
Excuse me, sweetheart,
Bill's cut his thumb.

2128
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:11,799
It's just a scratch.

2129
02:26:11,815 --> 02:26:14,932
Dick, this is my stepfather,
Professor Humbert.

2130
02:26:15,719 --> 02:26:18,358
- How do you do, Professor?
- How do you do?

2131
02:26:18,288 --> 02:26:20,597
This is our neighbor, Bill Crest.

2132
02:26:20,624 --> 02:26:23,457
- Glad to meet you, Professor.
- How do you do?

2133
02:26:23,727 --> 02:26:27,436
Gee, Lo's told me so much about you.

2134
02:26:31,201 --> 02:26:33,590
I guess we might as well fix that thumb.

2135
02:26:34,571 --> 02:26:36,766
This is a grand surprise, Professor.

2136
02:26:37,274 --> 02:26:39,947
When you didn't answer the letter
we were afraid that you were...

2137
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:42,902
...still sore at Lo for having run away
from home.

2138
02:26:47,751 --> 02:26:50,504
- How about a beer?
- No, thank you.

2139
02:26:50,654 --> 02:26:53,566
I'll bet you're dry after that long drive.

2140
02:26:53,724 --> 02:26:56,397
This is some of that foreign beer.
You'll like it.

2141
02:26:56,326 --> 02:26:57,645
No beer, thank you.

2142
02:26:57,628 --> 02:26:58,981
Bandages are upstairs.

2143
02:26:59,162 --> 02:27:01,312
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

2144
02:27:01,832 --> 02:27:04,869
- Can I get you anything else?
- Nothing, thank you.

2145
02:27:05,168 --> 02:27:07,079
How are you two getting along?

2146
02:27:07,137 --> 02:27:08,286
Just fine.

2147
02:27:09,206 --> 02:27:11,322
Speak up. His phone's on the blink.

2148
02:27:11,174 --> 02:27:12,368
One of those for me?

2149
02:27:12,409 --> 02:27:13,728
Sure, hon.

2150
02:27:17,648 --> 02:27:20,287
I hope you're planning on staying awhile.

2151
02:27:20,317 --> 02:27:23,787
You caught us a little unprepared
but we'll try and make you feel at home.

2152
02:27:23,787 --> 02:27:26,426
I shall have to be on my way, I'm afraid.

2153
02:27:26,456 --> 02:27:28,492
You can have the bed upstairs.

2154
02:27:28,358 --> 02:27:30,918
We sleep down here because
Lo likes to watch the TV.

2155
02:27:30,894 --> 02:27:32,566
He can't stay, Dick.

2156
02:27:33,764 --> 02:27:35,755
What a shame. I wish you could.

2157
02:27:37,601 --> 02:27:39,796
Why don't you tell him about Alaska?

2158
02:27:40,437 --> 02:27:43,634
Yeah. I guess Lo explained to you
about going to Alaska...

2159
02:27:43,674 --> 02:27:45,824
...and all that, in the letter.

2160
02:27:45,809 --> 02:27:47,800
It's a marvelous opportunity.

2161
02:27:47,678 --> 02:27:50,954
An opportunity for a guy like me
to get in on the ground floor.

2162
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:52,972
Industry's opening up and...

2163
02:27:52,916 --> 02:27:55,384
...if we can scrape together
enough money...

2164
02:27:55,385 --> 02:27:58,502
...with maybe your help, well, we can go.

2165
02:27:58,622 --> 02:28:02,058
We've got a few back debts,
we kind of over-extended ourselves.

2166
02:28:03,393 --> 02:28:04,872
How are the Farlows?

2167
02:28:05,629 --> 02:28:09,668
John Farlow's all right. It was he
who gave me your letter, of course.

2168
02:28:09,566 --> 02:28:12,683
She's sure a swell kid, Professor Haze.
She sure is.

2169
02:28:12,536 --> 02:28:16,973
She's just nuts about dogs and kids.
She's going to make a swell mother, too.

2170
02:28:18,241 --> 02:28:22,519
Alaska's a great place for kids, you know.
Lots of room for them to run around.

2171
02:28:24,348 --> 02:28:26,066
Well, it's as good as new.

2172
02:28:26,683 --> 02:28:31,438
Well, we'd better get back to work, Bill.
I guess you two have a lot to talk about.

2173
02:28:32,322 --> 02:28:34,836
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
Professor.

2174
02:28:35,292 --> 02:28:38,648
When you've finished, Dad,
I hope you don't mind me calling you that...

2175
02:28:38,662 --> 02:28:41,654
...come out back and I'll show you
what I'm making for the kid.

2176
02:28:41,732 --> 02:28:42,801
Thank you.

2177
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,878
Just holler, sweetheart,
if you want me for KP.

2178
02:28:51,041 --> 02:28:53,191
Dick's awfully sweet, isn't he?

2179
02:28:55,312 --> 02:28:56,381
Come here.

2180
02:28:56,446 --> 02:28:57,799
What's going on?

2181
02:28:58,749 --> 02:28:59,943
What are you doing?

2182
02:28:59,983 --> 02:29:03,055
This may be neither here nor there
but I've got to say it.

2183
02:29:02,919 --> 02:29:04,557
Life is very short.

2184
02:29:04,888 --> 02:29:07,846
Between here and that old car outside
are 25 paces.

2185
02:29:07,758 --> 02:29:10,716
Make them, now, right now.

2186
02:29:10,627 --> 02:29:11,616
What?

2187
02:29:11,728 --> 02:29:14,526
Come away with me now, just as you are.

2188
02:29:14,664 --> 02:29:18,134
You mean you'll give us the money
only if I go to a hotel with you?

2189
02:29:18,301 --> 02:29:19,893
No, you've got it all wrong.

2190
02:29:19,870 --> 02:29:22,668
I want you to leave your husband
and this awful house.

2191
02:29:22,606 --> 02:29:26,599
I want you to live with me and die with me
and everything with me.

2192
02:29:27,077 --> 02:29:28,874
You must be crazy.

2193
02:29:28,812 --> 02:29:32,930
No, I'm perfectly serious, Lo.
I've never been less crazy in all my life.

2194
02:29:32,816 --> 02:29:35,967
We'll start afresh. We can forget
everything that has happened.

2195
02:29:36,019 --> 02:29:38,738
- No, it's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

2196
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,041
Keep your voice down.

2197
02:29:40,057 --> 02:29:42,048
Don't tell me it's too late, because it's not.

2198
02:29:42,292 --> 02:29:44,522
If you want time to think, that's all right...

2199
02:29:44,561 --> 02:29:47,837
...because I've waited already
for three years and I can wait...

2200
02:29:47,831 --> 02:29:49,901
...for the rest of my life if necessary.

2201
02:29:49,966 --> 02:29:53,083
You're not giving anything up,
there's nothing here to keep you.

2202
02:29:53,303 --> 02:29:56,739
All right, this man is married to you,
but that's purely incidental.

2203
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:59,891
It was an accident that you met him
in the first place.

2204
02:29:59,943 --> 02:30:02,776
You're not bound to him,
whereas you are bound to me...

2205
02:30:02,712 --> 02:30:06,591
...by everything that we have
lived through together, you and I.

2206
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:09,528
I'm going to have his baby in three months.

2207
02:30:10,954 --> 02:30:11,989
I know.

2208
02:30:12,756 --> 02:30:17,068
I've ruined too many things in my life.
I can't do that to him, he needs me.

2209
02:30:20,697 --> 02:30:22,813
Come on now, don't make a scene.

2210
02:30:22,899 --> 02:30:25,891
Stop crying! He can walk in here
at any minute.

2211
02:30:27,003 --> 02:30:29,597
Will you please stop crying?

2212
02:30:39,850 --> 02:30:41,841
There are no strings attached...

2213
02:30:43,854 --> 02:30:45,845
...it's your money anyway...

2214
02:30:46,756 --> 02:30:49,111
...it comes from the rent of the house.

2215
02:30:50,927 --> 02:30:52,758
There's $400 in cash.

2216
02:30:53,363 --> 02:30:55,115
Four hundred dollars!

2217
02:30:55,866 --> 02:30:59,461
I've made out a check here for $2,500.

2218
02:31:03,373 --> 02:31:04,772
There's someone in Ramsdale...

2219
02:31:04,774 --> 02:31:08,244
...who's prepared to take care
of the mortgages on the house...

2220
02:31:08,812 --> 02:31:11,770
...and make a down payment of $10,000.

2221
02:31:13,884 --> 02:31:15,476
Here's the papers.

2222
02:31:17,053 --> 02:31:19,567
You mean we're getting $13,000?

2223
02:31:21,024 --> 02:31:22,616
That's wonderful!

2224
02:31:23,059 --> 02:31:25,050
Come on now, don't cry.

2225
02:31:28,999 --> 02:31:30,148
I'm sorry.

2226
02:31:31,134 --> 02:31:33,045
Try to understand.

2227
02:31:36,406 --> 02:31:38,920
I'm really sorry that I cheated so much...

2228
02:31:39,576 --> 02:31:42,249
...but I guess that's just the way things are.

2229
02:31:47,417 --> 02:31:48,930
Where are you going?

2230
02:31:53,924 --> 02:31:56,233
Listen! Let's keep in touch.

2231
02:31:56,426 --> 02:31:58,894
I'll write to you when we get to Alaska.

2232
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,029
Quilty!

2233
02:32:55,151 --> 02:32:56,140
Quilty!
