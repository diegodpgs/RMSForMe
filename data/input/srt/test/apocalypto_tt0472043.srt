"A great civilization is not conquered from without
until it has destroyed itself from within."
W. Durant

2
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,423
The heart...

3
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,807
...for 'Smoke Frog'.

4
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,142
Thank you.

5
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,359
This liver for 'Curl Nose'.

6
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,444
Thank you.

7
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,492
'Cocoa Leaf'...

8
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,826
...the ears.

9
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,286
Thank you.

10
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,707
And for you 'Blunted'...

11
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,128
...the balls.

12
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,549
Not this again.

13
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,009
I'm helping you.

14
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,344
Then you eat them!

15
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,846
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

16
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,973
Do you fellows?

17
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,807
No.

18
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,849
Of course not!

19
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,184
Sometimes!

20
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,185
What do you think?

21
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,353
No!

22
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,354
No, no!

23
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,690
But how many times does it take?

24
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,567
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

25
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,321
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

26
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,238
Shall I tell him?

27
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,576
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

28
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,038
You've never had them?

29
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,790
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

30
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,917
None of you?

31
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,589
No, but it's been fun watching you...

32
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,429
This was your idea!

33
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,725
Get him off me!

34
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,233
Calm down!

35
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,629
Why do you let them treat you like this?

36
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,672
Be strong.

37
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,758
Where is your pride?

38
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,849
It all works...Yes?

39
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,479
Yes...

40
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,816
...I just can't make children.

41
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,824
There is something I will tell you...

42
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,786
...but I warn you, it's very powerful.

43
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,205
What do you speak of?

44
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,624
The soanzo leaf.

45
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,377
The soanzo leaf?

46
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,338
From the great marshes in the south...

47
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,179
This is what gave me my 10 children.

48
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,729
No! No! Wait...

49
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,400
You have to rub them on...down there.

50
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,361
Just before you next try.

51
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,697
Apply it generously...

52
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,370
I don't know how to thank you.

53
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,542
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

54
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,043
Your wife?

55
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,379
No, her mother.

56
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,090
The old hag wants grandchildren.

57
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,226
Give me some meat.

58
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,729
Here, work on this...

59
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,939
...pure meat...

60
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,943
...ball breath.

61
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:18,265
What do you want?

62
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,908
I am 'Flint Sky'. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

63
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,831
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

64
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,376
'Jaguar Paw', my son.

65
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,046
He hunts this forest with me.

66
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,051
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

67
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,572
A good catch?

68
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,408
Good waters here.

69
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,537
The forest gives much here.

70
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,587
We ask only to pass through.

71
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,756
Pass.

72
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,430
Keep safe as you pass.

73
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,644
Let's go.

74
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,641
Our lands were ravaged.

75
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,436
We seek a new beginning.

76
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,986
Your lands were ravaged?

77
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,324
Yes...

78
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,328
We seek a new beginning...

79
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,164
Be still.

80
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,331
My son!

81
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,626
Be still.

82
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,049
Back to the village.

83
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,713
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

84
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,719
You are troubled.

85
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,721
Yes, I am.

86
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,367
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

87
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,077
I do not understand.

88
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,621
Fear.

89
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,919
Deep rotting fear.

90
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,047
They were infected by it.

91
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,216
Did you see?

92
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,927
Fear is a sickness.

93
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,311
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

94
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:21,276
It has tainted your peace already.

95
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,615
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

96
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,828
Strike it from your heart.

97
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,747
Do not bring it into our village.

98
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,918
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

99
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,964
...at the sacred hill of our fathers.

100
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,969
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

101
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,857
Oh, here he is!

102
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,151
The big lump!

103
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,486
He's useless.

104
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,655
He can't do it.

105
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,992
You! Yes you!

106
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,121
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

107
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,457
Get inside!

108
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,505
Damn you! Get in there!

109
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,341
Old woman, please.

110
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,717
Move it!

111
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,556
You don't work!

112
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,560
What are you laughing about?

113
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:50,031
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

114
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,076
Mother, that's enough.

115
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,205
Do not come out until you make a child.

116
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,375
Two would be better!

117
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,542
What?

118
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Twins you oaf.

119
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,722
Mother.

120
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,061
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

121
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,854
Just get busy.

122
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,399
Mom...

123
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,530
She's gone.

124
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,826
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

125
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,787
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

126
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,247
I say boy.

127
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,331
Roasted!

128
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,251
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

129
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,587
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

130
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,590
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

131
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,844
Wait...

132
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,930
That's our 'Turtles Run'.
That's our eldest.

133
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

134
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,812
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

135
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,693
...and a crush for my youngest.

136
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,322
Tapir it is.

137
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,848
One day, old man!

138
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,725
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

139
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,580
And a Man sat alone.

140
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,542
Drenched deep in sadness.

141
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,045
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

142
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,466
"We do not like to see you so sad...

143
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,722
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

144
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,102
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

145
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,732
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

146
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,946
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

147
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,452
The jaguar said:

148
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,749
"You shall be strong like me."

149
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,590
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

150
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:24,138
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

151
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,517
And so it went with all the animals.

152
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,980
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

153
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,815
...he left.

154
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,653
Then the owl said to the other animals:

155
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,449
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things...

156
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,870
"Suddenly I am afraid."

157
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,876
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

158
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,004
"Now his sadness will stop."

159
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,674
But the owl replied: "No."

160
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,179
"I saw a hole in the Man...

161
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,976
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill...

162
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,523
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

163
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,862
"He will go on taking and taking...

164
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,242
"Until one day the World will say:

165
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:31,163
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

166
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,754
Come back to me...

167
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,926
Come back to me.

168
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,832
My son is dancing.

169
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,669
Your son is happy.

170
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,723
What do you want?

171
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,491
Run!

172
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,052
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

173
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,276
The dog.

174
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,490
Get up! Get up! Now!

175
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,859
Go to the forest.

176
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,111
Run! Do not look back.

177
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,764
No! No! I am afraid!

178
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,141
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

179
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,559
Be strong...

180
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,103
I am afraid!

181
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,230
Be strong.

182
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,497
Tie him up!

183
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,701
Father!

184
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,247
The others. I have to help.

185
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,124
No, don't leave us!

186
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,086
I will come back, I promise.

187
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,587
Don't you leave!

188
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,755
I promise.

189
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,714
Stay, please stay.

190
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,091
Father, don't go.

191
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,107
Very nice.

192
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,155
Stop!

193
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,248
Tie him up!

194
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,046
I want him alive.

195
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,859
Sorry Father.

196
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,880
That's enough!

197
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,268
Stand him up.

198
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,610
Move away.

199
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,251
My son.

200
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,930
Don't be afraid.

201
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,699
Almost...

202
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,217
...that's your name.

203
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,388
"Almost".

204
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,739
Our life is over.

205
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,454
Shame...

206
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,755
Shame!

207
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,970
Cowards!

208
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,435
Let's move!

209
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,451
We move out now.

210
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,286
They are back.

211
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,666
Get up!

212
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,920
Heave!

213
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,846
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

214
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,142
Hold still.

215
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,987
Can you see?

216
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,323
Yes.

217
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,617
Get back to your line.

218
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,221
Come with us...

219
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,775
Get up.

220
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,623
Leave him alone, "Almost".

221
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,669
I said get up.

222
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,991
Up, up...

223
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,034
...that's it.

224
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,496
Let's go!

225
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,295
This man is a good friend of yours...

226
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,165
Don't worry...

227
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,712
I'll take care of them.

228
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,926
They are mine now.

229
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:56,270
Gentle 'Ixchel'. Tender mother of mercy.

230
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:03,236
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

231
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,773
One more.

232
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,090
Ready?

233
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,569
Hold on! Hold on!

234
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,075
Wait...

235
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,411
...let's see what happens.

236
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,337
That's it!

237
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,762
Hurry!

238
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,682
Pull! Be strong!

239
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,577
Yes! You did it!

240
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,083
Good work!

241
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,640
Can you breathe?...Good.

242
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,337
Wait here.

243
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,372
What's become of my capture?

244
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,628
Dead weight.

245
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,548
He nearly took the rest with him.

246
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,511
I let him go.

247
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,517
You. Let him go?

248
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:55,069
Shall we now do what you want?

249
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,368
Let us try that.

250
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,435
Don't let any others go.

251
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,402
Let's move.

252
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,794
Get up "Almost".

253
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,465
We don't want to lose you just yet.

254
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,643
Stand up, boy.

255
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,946
You proved yourself today, my son.

256
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:06,450
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

257
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,538
Thank you Father.

258
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,008
Take it...

259
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,969
...it's yours.

260
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,684
It has taken many lives.

261
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,531
Get some rest.

262
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,213
Resting brothers...

263
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,842
...fathers, mothers, wives.

264
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:10,055
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

265
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:15,185
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

266
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,898
She stopped screaming...

267
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,070
...too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

268
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,574
We saw how she fought them.

269
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,452
But in the final moment?

270
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,955
If she let them...

271
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:42,254
...the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

272
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:48,761
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the 'Ceiba' Tree.

273
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,648
I need to know.

274
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,946
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

275
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:15,329
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

276
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:22,461
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

277
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,008
...if I do not find my 'Sky Flower' there.

278
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,517
Don't rain.

279
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,687
I am walking here.

280
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,513
Keep away, she has the sickness.

281
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,749
Get back!

282
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,804
You fear me?

283
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,808
So you should...

284
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,853
...all you who are vile.

285
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,443
Would you like to know how you will die?

286
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:44,329
The sacred time is near...

287
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,669
Beware the blackness of day.

288
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,635
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

289
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:06,184
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

290
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:13,150
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

291
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,154
...and scratch out the earth.

292
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,574
Scratch you out.

293
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,536
And end your world.

294
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,254
He's with us now.

295
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,056
...day will be like night.

296
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,186
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

297
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,426
Where are they taking us?

298
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:11,143
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

299
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,187
What happens there?

300
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,523
I do not know...

301
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,611
...but the earth bleeds.

302
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,533
We are near.

303
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,868
Salvation!

304
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,538
He has the laughing sickness.

305
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,541
He likes you!

306
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,378
Help me!

307
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,555
Save me.

308
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,065
Die like a man.

309
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,726
Welcome back.

310
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,354
Have you been successful?

311
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,064
Ask my son.

312
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,359
How many captives?

313
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,568
Deal with my son.

314
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,738
A fair price.

315
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,908
As always, trust me.

316
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,410
Good.

317
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,972
How much will you give me?

318
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,619
Who will buy this woman?

319
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,038
No...she's too old.

320
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,166
She can be useful.

321
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,376
She can cook...clean...

322
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,005
Useless old woman!

323
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,177
No sale.

324
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,309
Go!

325
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,686
Go on.

326
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:33,783
These are the days of our great lament.

327
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,164
The land thirsts.

328
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:47,004
A great plague infests our crops.

329
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,886
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

330
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:03,521
They say this strife has made us weak.

331
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:07,567
That we have become empty.

332
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,655
They say that we rot.

333
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:27,211
Great people of the banner of the sun...

334
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,547
I say...

335
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,550
...we are strong.

336
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,098
We are a people of destiny.

337
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,190
Destined to be the masters of time.

338
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,530
Destined to be nearest to the Gods.

339
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,591
Mighty 'Kukulkan'!

340
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,764
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

341
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,727
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

342
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,104
To exalt you in your glory.

343
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,608
To make our people prosper.

344
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,445
To prepare for your return.

345
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,284
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

346
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,162
With your blood you renew the world!

347
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,498
From age to age.

348
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,584
Thanks be to you.

349
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,476
The heart of God!

350
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,475
Come back to me.

351
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,278
Brother...

352
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,990
Journey well...

353
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,034
No.

354
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,662
I can't go.

355
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,790
Not now...

356
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:39,351
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

357
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,146
Rejoice!

358
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:46,442
'Kukulkan' has drunk his fill of blood.

359
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,612
We have sated his thirst.

360
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,448
Great God.

361
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,659
Show us that you are pleased.

362
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,496
Let your light return upon us.

363
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:06,939
What of these captives?

364
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,570
Dispose of them.

365
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,149
I need a finisher.

366
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,488
You.

367
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,163
Release them.

368
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,089
You watch.

369
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,028
I'm ready!

370
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,994
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

371
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:48,373
Go to it.

372
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,626
You're free...

373
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,837
...now run.

374
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,509
I said run.

375
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,181
Run!

376
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,922
Not bad.

377
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,442
Your turn.

378
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,784
Run.

379
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,153
Run!

380
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,229
Sleep.

381
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,441
Sleep, sleep now my son.

382
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,819
The pain will be no more.

383
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,073
Sleep.

384
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,299
He didn't come this way.

385
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,523
He's in the trees.

386
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,526
Spread out.

387
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:43,945
Keep your eyes up.

388
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:07,385
Quiet.

389
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,190
He's coming right at us.

390
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:37,582
There!

391
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,536
He would have wanted me to have it.

392
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:43,666
The omen is bad...

393
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:48,671
Mighty 'Ek Chuah' we beg you...

394
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:54,177
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the Jaguar.

395
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,681
The omen is bad...

396
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:02,352
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

397
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:06,230
...the omen was foretold...

398
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:11,819
...and now we have a fear more grave...

399
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:16,199
...today I saw the day
become like night...

400
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:26,376
I saw a man run with the Jaguar...

401
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:34,384
...we must not let this man
make feet from us.

402
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,260
Enough.

403
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,891
Your words mean nothing.

404
01:39:43,268 --> 01:39:45,520
He runs because he is afraid.

405
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:50,525
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

406
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,280
...and have him watch me wear it.

407
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:05,248
We leave now.

408
01:42:12,876 --> 01:42:14,043
Stay back.

409
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,115
Here!

410
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:52,808
The omen was bad...

411
01:43:56,521 --> 01:43:57,647
He's fucked.

412
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:02,360
Help...please...

413
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,487
Hanging Moss...

414
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:07,782
See him out.

415
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:31,889
Open your veins. It's quicker.

416
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,696
Travel well.

417
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,259
So much for your prophecies.

418
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,391
It's not over!

419
01:48:28,418 --> 01:48:30,044
I am 'Jaguar Paw'...

420
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:32,296
Son of 'Flint Sky'...

421
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:37,092
My father hunted
this forest before me...

422
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:40,804
My name is 'Jaguar Paw'.

423
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,265
I am a hunter.

424
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,102
This is my forest.

425
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:52,816
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

426
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:56,946
Come on!

427
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:01,283
We are going over.

428
01:49:01,868 --> 01:49:04,620
We climb down around.

429
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:07,957
We cannot let him get away.

430
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:09,792
We cannot afford...

431
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:32,147
We all jump.

432
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,826
I am 'Jaguar Paw'.

433
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,496
This is my forest.

434
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:39,293
And I am not afraid.

435
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:49,298
You go. I'll wait here.

436
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:20,629
Almost...

437
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:50,158
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

438
02:01:17,186 --> 02:01:18,979
Get up here.

439
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:35,412
Go back!

440
02:02:04,817 --> 02:02:05,525
Quick!

441
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:07,068
Hurry up!

442
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:35,790
What are they?

443
02:08:37,459 --> 02:08:39,293
They bring men.

444
02:08:43,966 --> 02:08:45,842
Should we go to them?

445
02:08:54,143 --> 02:08:55,977
We should go to the forest.

446
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:04,777
To seek a new beginning.

447
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,325
Come 'Turtles Run'...
