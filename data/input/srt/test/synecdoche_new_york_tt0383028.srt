1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:45,461
- 7:45 on this beautiful, almost balmy
22nd of September in Schenectady.

2
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,212
And it's the first day of fall.

3
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,132
So in honor of that fact,
we have Elke Putzkammer...

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,384
...professor of literature
at Union college...

5
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,803
...to talk about autumn in poetry
and literature.

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,889
- Good morning, professor.
- Hi, Alex.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,517
So, what about it? Why do
so many people write about the fall?

8
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,229
Well, I think it's seen
as the beginning of the end, really.

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,192
If the year is a life, then September,
the beginning of fall...

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,612
...is when the bloom is off the rose
and things start to die.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,699
It's a melancholy month and maybe
because of that, quite beautiful.

12
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,743
Is there something
you might read to us?

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,120
Oh, I'd love to.

14
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,166
Whoever has no house now
Will never have one.

15
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,711
Whoever is alone will stay alone

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,424
Will sit, read, write long letters
Through the evening

17
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,095
And wander the boulevards
Up and down, restlessly

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,514
While the dry leaves are blowing

19
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,974
Goodness, that harsh, isn't it?

20
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:45,312
Well, perhaps. But truthful.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,775
Mommy, done.

22
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,902
Okay.

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,738
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,990
- I tried not to wake you.
- Well, thanks.

25
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,493
You didn't. I just...
You know, I couldn't get up.

26
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,836
- Caden, can you get that?
- It's Maria, I don't want to.

27
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,131
- Caden... Oh, that's weird.
- Hey, it's me. How are you?

28
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,508
Mommy, is something wrong
with my poop?

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,470
No, honey, it's just green.
You probably ate something green.

30
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,057
I didn't. What's wrong with me?

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,394
I have to get that, Olive.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

32
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,855
- But, Mommy...
- Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive.

33
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,692
Oh, nothing.
Just wiping Olive's ass. You?

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,404
- An earthquake in Kashmir...
- Oh, you're kidding. Holy fuck.

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,658
...has killed an estimated 73,000...
- I don't feel well.

36
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,910
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,892
- March in Washington, D.c., today,
October 15th.

38
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,605
- Harold Pinter died.
- Well, he's old, right?

39
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,982
- No, wait. He won the Nobel Prize.
- Mom.

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,443
- What, honey?
- Do you need to look at my poop?

41
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,239
- You sure it's all right?
- It's fine, Olive. Just flush.

42
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,117
What if it's alive? What if I kill it?

43
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,494
- It's green like plants.
- It's not alive, honey.

44
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,415
Remember the production of
The Dumb Waiter I did at Albanyfest?

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,127
Have your oatmeal, honey.

46
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,923
- I want peanut butter and jelly.
- You said oatmeal.

47
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,468
- This isn't a restaurant.
- I don't want oatmeal.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,137
- Okay. Fine.
- Mommy, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:47,226
They found avian flu in Turkey.
In the country Turkey, not turkeys.

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,188
- Can I watch TV till school?
- In some chickens. Yeah.

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,944
There is a secret something at play
under the surface...

52
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,988
...growing like an invisible virus
of thought.

53
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,241
But you're being changed by it...

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,117
- Milk's expired.
- Okay.

55
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,327
Jesus.

56
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,664
- You better eat this.
- I will.

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,291
Yeah.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,752
How did I guess
you'd ask me that question?

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,463
Happy Halloween, Schenectady.

60
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,841
And how long have you been
in New York for?

61
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,845
The first black graduate
of the University of Alabama died.

62
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,931
Vivian Malone Jones.

63
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,686
Stroke, 63.

64
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,288
Fuck!

65
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,958
God! Somebody! Adele, help!

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,629
- Jesus, Caden, what the fuck?
- I was shaving and the thing flew off!

67
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,299
Oh, my God!
Jesus, look at your head.

68
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,551
Oh, shit.

69
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh, God, I can't turn it.

70
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,139
Oh, wait.

71
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,564
- Mommy, Daddy has blood.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,401
- Will there be a scar?
- Probably. It looks like a mud flap.

73
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,863
- I prefer there not to be a scar.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,823
That fellow is annoying.

75
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,534
He's in here every week,
like clockwork.

76
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,371
There. I think that should...
Let's see.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,251
- What?
- Change in bowel movements?

78
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,504
It's a little more yellow than usual.
Why?

79
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,426
Yeah, I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist.

80
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,928
- A neurologist?
- What? No.

81
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,890
An ophthalmologist.
I said, ophthalmologist.

82
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,142
Do you hear that?

83
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,894
Yeah.

84
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,773
And today is Tuesday.
Mommy, is today Tuesday?

85
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,860
No, honey, today is Friday.
So, what exactly did he say?

86
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,328
That my pupils weren't properly
opening and closing.

87
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,788
Dilating.

88
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,290
- No.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,168
- I don't think that's what he said.
- Yes.

90
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,879
- That's not what he said.
- Is it the bump to your head?

91
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,672
He doesn't know. Maybe.

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,967
He said he doesn't think so,
but maybe. But he doesn't know.

93
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,638
- But maybe. Who knows?
- Okay, Jesus, Caden, I got it.

94
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,682
- He doesn't know...
- Sorry. I'm a little anxious.

95
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,310
- Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?
- No, honey.

96
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,355
- It's the start of something awful.
- Do I have to get a shot?

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,149
- Course not.
- Did you tell him I have green poo?

98
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,568
- It's fucked timing.
- Call the plumber. Hey.

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,779
Sorry. I have rehearsal. Fuck.

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,991
- Hey, come on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Everybody, sorry.

101
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,327
How many years
until I have to get more shots?

102
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:58,834
- Not for a really long time, babe.
- A million years?

103
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,796
- Remember what Dr. Woodman said...
- Dad, what's a plumber?

104
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,881
- He's a man...
- Or a woman, Dad.

105
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:11,680
Right. He's a man or a woman
who fixes sinks and toilets and...

106
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,890
- Do you know what pipes are?
- No.

107
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,519
- Hey, Jim. I had an accident.
- Like to smoke out of?

108
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,814
A different kind of pipe, honey.
All right, bye.

109
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,028
Houses have pipes,
and they're made of...

110
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,948
They're like tubes,
and they're behind the walls...

111
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,243
...and they're under the floors
and everywhere.

112
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,870
- And...
- What's the matter?

113
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,330
- Every single where?
- It's okay, honey.

114
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,292
They just carry water
to and from sinks and toilets.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,462
- It's like in your body. You have veins.
- Capillaries.

116
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,338
Capillaries filled with blood.

117
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,050
I have blood? I don't want blood.
I don't want blood.

118
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,470
- What are you doing?
- Trying to explain plumbing.

119
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,096
- Stop.
- I can't do this now.

120
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,892
- Don't worry, you don't have blood.
- Don't tell her she doesn't have blood.

121
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,895
- Caden, stop it.
- I don't want blood.

122
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,404
Thanks for getting me in right away.

123
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,411
- Was it the bump to the head?
- No.

124
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,586
Could be, but I think we need
to get you to a neurologist.

125
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,339
- Neurologist?
- It's a brain expert.

126
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,840
I know what a neurologist is.

127
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,094
- I thought from the way you asked...
- I just thought you said "urologist."

128
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,603
- Why do I need to see a neurologist?
- Just for a look-see.

129
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,440
The eyes are part of the brain,
after all.

130
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,110
No, that's not true, is it?

131
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,660
- Why would I say it if it weren't true?
- It doesn't seem right.

132
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,080
Like morally correct,
or "right" as in accurate?

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,130
I don't know. Accurate, I guess?

134
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,634
Interesting.

135
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,720
Now, when you kick off, boy,
I want a 70-yard boot.

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,889
And get right down the field
under the ball.

137
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,977
And when you hit, hit low and hit hard,
because it's important, boy.

138
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,563
There's all kinds of important people
in the stands.

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,275
And the first thing you know... Ben?

140
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,986
Ben, where do I?

141
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,157
- Ben, how do I?
- Willy, you coming up?

142
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,785
Willy?

143
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,830
Willy, answer me.

144
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,084
Willy! No!

145
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,503
- Oh, Jesus, come on.
- Oh, crap.

146
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,672
Claire, are you okay?
What's happening here?

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,091
It's too late in the game
to have these problems.

148
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,677
- I know, Caden. I'm sorry. We'll get it.
- Oh, my God.

149
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,015
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think the wig saved my life.

150
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,018
- Yeah.
- It's okay, honestly.

151
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,728
That was good, Tom.

152
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,979
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,399
I was trying something different.
I was crashing differently.

154
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,902
- Ambivalently.
- Yeah, I saw that. I liked it.

155
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,871
Try to keep in mind that
a young person playing Willy Loman...

156
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,167
...thinks he's only pretending
to be at the end of a life full of despair.

157
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,295
But the tragedy is that we know
that you, the young actor...

158
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,882
...will end up in this very place
of desolation.

159
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,717
Okay.

160
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,555
That's great.

161
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,060
- Let's try it again. How long, David?
- I think 15.

162
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,481
Anything?

163
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,234
So now what?

164
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,199
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,578
- In search of the elusive signal.
- The signal's good here, oddly.

166
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,790
- That is odd.
- I know. Cell phones, they're crazy.

167
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,376
- See you in a few.
- Yep.

168
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,758
Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said
I should see a Dr. Scoriano.

169
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,387
My pupils don't work.

170
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,063
I think I have blood in my stool.

171
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,777
That stool in your office?

172
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,116
- When I was pregnant with Olive.
- What was it like?

173
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,744
I don't know. Hopeful or something.
Like something was gonna change.

174
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,955
- Yeah, something did. No?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,748
- Yeah, of course.
- I mean, bigtime.

176
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,751
I mean, maybe not as much
as I'd hoped.

177
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,337
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to say.

178
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,216
There are no terrible things to say
in here, only true and false.

179
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,804
- Can I say something awful?
- Yes, please do.

180
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,309
I've fantasized about Caden dying.

181
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,524
Being able to start again, guilt-free.

182
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,112
I know that's... That's bad.

183
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,824
- Caden, does that feel terrible?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,951
Okay, good.

185
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,013
It's a nightmare in there.

186
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,932
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,570
So, I'm reading The Trial.

188
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,197
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,701
- You like?
- Love.

190
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,330
I'm such an idiot
for not knowing about this book.

191
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,458
- It's famous, as it turns out.
- Yeah.

192
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,252
You're not an idiot.

193
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,257
Then you say:

194
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:26,554
"In fact, Hazel, you're very bright,
and I love your eyes."

195
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,562
- In fact, Hazel, you're very bright.
- Oh, am I?

196
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,692
- And I love your eyes.
- Do you? Oh, you're a darling.

197
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,951
Then what do I say?

198
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,913
- I can't say what then you say.
- Why?

199
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,749
Because it's dirty.

200
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,880
Could you step out for a second?

201
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,968
Go ahead. I've seen boy parts.

202
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,771
- Can I take a piss in your sink?
- Yeah, sure. I guess.

203
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,284
We're sold out.

204
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,244
Great.

205
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,795
Gorgeous.

206
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,923
Thanks.

207
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,719
- How was rehearsal?
- Awful.

208
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,639
We have 560 lighting cues.

209
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,810
- I don't why I make it so complicated.
- Because that's what you do.

210
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,812
Yeah.

211
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,527
We got through it though.
That's really pretty.

212
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,781
Caden, I'm sorry, I...

213
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,745
I can't come tonight. I'm sorry.

214
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,081
I have two canvasses I have
to get ready to ship for tomorrow.

215
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,083
- I know it sucks...
- It's opening night.

216
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,754
I know. I wish I could come.
I would if I could.

217
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,923
- I've gotta get ready.
- Tomorrow...

218
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,842
I have to get ready.
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

219
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,511
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

220
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,158
Hey.

221
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,509
- Oh, boy, oh boy.
- Willy?

222
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,553
It's all right, I came back.

223
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,600
I hated myself tonight.

224
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,062
- Plus, I'm so... Excuse me.
- Hey, Tom.

225
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,647
I'm so bloated and enormous.

226
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,358
No, you look good. You were great.
I was very pleased.

227
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,403
- You okay?
- Sorry. A little bit of a headache.

228
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,238
Willy Loman.

229
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,868
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything.

230
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,246
You've been absolutely brilliant.

231
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,416
It's gonna be miserable
going ahead without you.

232
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,086
- I'll be around. I'll check in.
- I'm such a baby.

233
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,714
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk,
that's what.

234
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,093
Okay. Claire. Sweetheart.

235
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,975
- Good. Good job.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll get better.

236
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,728
- Good work.
- Don't worry, it'll get better.

237
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,859
Hey. I figured I'd better get in fast.

238
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,946
- Hey, you wanna sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

239
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:22,457
- Where's el wife-o?
- Had to work.

240
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,626
Her show in Berlin is in two weeks.

241
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,795
We're gonna go there
for like a month.

242
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,758
- Why do I like you so much?
- I couldn't begin to guess.

243
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,760
Me neither.

244
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,764
Do you get high, my friend?

245
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,143
You know, sometimes.

246
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,147
Do you want to now?
With me, in my car?

247
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,858
I get kind of...

248
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,945
...something when I'm stoned.

249
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,698
What does "something" mean?

250
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,159
You know...

251
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,662
...bothered.

252
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,832
- What does "bothered" mean?
- You know.

253
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,878
Bothered. Horny.

254
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,926
And me with a station wagon and all.
Could be dangerous.

255
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,514
- Yeah, could be.
- You're absolutely zero fun.

256
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,863
When are the reviews
gonna get here?

257
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,952
Don't know.

258
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,544
His best friends finger two babies...

259
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,088
One this big, one this big.
- And two kittens.

260
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,134
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden. How'd it go?

261
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,595
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,430
It's late.

263
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,393
Maria came over
to keep me company because...

264
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,687
And we just lost track.
I got everything done.

265
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,942
But I'm sorry I missed your play.
I'm sorry. But how'd it go?

266
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,695
Great. We're a hit.

267
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,406
Reviews are great.

268
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:23,077
Times said it was brilliant casting
young people as Willy and Linda.

269
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,248
- That's great, Caden. Good for you.
- Great.

270
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,002
I can't wait to see it tomorrow.
That's... Tonight.

271
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,254
That's great.

272
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,425
Wow, it's really late... Early.

273
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,760
Early.

274
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,222
It's late.
Hey, I would love to see it too.

275
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,934
- Can we get Maria a ticket?
- You're stoned.

276
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,230
I mean, a little. It's, you know...
I don't know.

277
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,233
But are you happy with it?

278
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,654
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love for you to see...
To know what you think.

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,865
It doesn't matter what I think.

280
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:06,454
Absolutely. It's all about
your artistic satisfaction, Caden.

281
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,799
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

282
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:35,066
- I've always loved this house.
- Yes, it's a wonderful place.

283
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,569
The truth is, I never really imagined
I could afford it.

284
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,738
Well, the sellers
are very motivated now.

285
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,998
It's a scary decision.
I never thought I'd buy a house alone.

286
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,002
But, you know, I'm 36,
and I wonder what it is I'm waiting for.

287
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,965
- Home buying is always scary.
- And with the fire and all especially.

288
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,384
Well, it's a good size though,
2200 square feet...

289
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,970
...not including
the partially finished basement.

290
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,264
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,435
- I'm thinking I should go.
- It's a perfect size for someone alone.

292
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:18,150
I like it, I do. I'm just really concerned
about dying in the fire.

293
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,779
It's a big decision
how one prefers to die.

294
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,865
Would you like to meet my son?
Derek.

295
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,620
Derek's living in the basement
since his divorce, if that's okay.

296
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,497
Hey, Mom.

297
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,089
- Let's go, Ma.
- I want just a minute.

298
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,391
I never...

299
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,896
Forgive me, dear. I can't cry.

300
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,401
I don't know what it is,
but I can't cry.

301
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,992
It seems to me
that you're just on another trip.

302
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,746
I keep expecting you.
Why did you do it?

303
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,916
I search and I search
and I can't understand it.

304
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,546
I made the last payment
on the house today.

305
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,426
We're free and clear.
We're free. We're free.

306
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,851
- Well done.
- Bravo.

307
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:39,648
- Well done. It was very successful.
- I thought it was wonderful.

308
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,901
Why did the older people
look so young?

309
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,612
It was a choice, Dad.
I'll explain later.

310
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,034
I can't get excited about your restaging
someone else's old play, it just...

311
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,744
There's nothing personal in it.

312
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,330
People are coming out of the theater
crying.

313
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,916
Great. Be a fucking tool
of suburban, blue-haired...

314
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,834
...regional-theater subscribers.

315
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,795
- You didn't you think it was long?
- No.

316
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,421
But what are you leaving behind?

317
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,882
You act as if you have forever
to figure it out.

318
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,551
When you're dead, there's no time.
The world is...

319
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,055
I don't know.
I slept maybe three hours.

320
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,432
So we're both tired.

321
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,145
No, I cuddled with Olive all night.
It was great.

322
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,153
Morning. Morning.

323
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,575
- Morning, Caden.
- I think I might have arthritis.

324
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,285
Friends on fire.

325
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,456
I'm going to.

326
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,588
No, I know exactly.
Okay, I will. I'll call you later.

327
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,006
I know. You're right. Bye.

328
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,470
My joints are stiff.

329
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,100
Who was that?

330
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,479
- Maria.
- Right.

331
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,691
Three hours since you spoke.

332
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,528
Caden, I think I wanna go to Berlin
with just Olive.

333
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,951
- I think it would be good for us.
- Oh, Christ.

334
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,036
Morning, kiddos.

335
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,374
Why don't you want me to go?

336
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:25,880
You know, I think it would be a good
thing for the two of us to do alone.

337
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,717
How do you think I'm supposed
to respond to something like that?

338
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,389
- Want me to zip your coat up?
- Yeah.

339
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,189
What's wrong with your face,
Daddy?

340
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,609
It's pustules.

341
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,820
It's called sycosis.

342
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,074
Spelled differently than "psychosis,"
but it sounds the same.

343
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,868
I don't know what that means.

344
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,578
Of course not.

345
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,790
Well, there are two kinds of psychosis.
They're spelled differently.

346
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,670
P-S-Y is like if you're crazy,
like Mama.

347
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,591
S-Y is like these ugly things
on my face.

348
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,552
- You could have both, though.
- I could, but I don't.

349
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,397
Can I ask you something, Ad?

350
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,238
Have I disappointed you somehow?

351
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,535
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're just spending a little time apart.

352
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,124
We'll talk when I get back, okay?

353
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,799
Everyone is disappointing.
The more you know someone, it just...

354
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,637
This whole romantic-love thing,
it's just a projection anyway, right?

355
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,181
I mean, I don't know.

356
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,276
I love you.

358
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,494
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know.

359
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,378
We'll talk when I get back.

360
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,800
Okay?

361
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,607
Flurostatin TR
allows you to live life...

362
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,694
...when it's your turn to face
the challenges of chemotherapy.

363
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,879
Ask your doctor
if Flurostatin TR is right for you.

364
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,149
- And I'm on the first train
out of Palookaville.

365
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,985
- The Miracle Brush
can scour everything from bottles...

366
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,905
- Rise and shine...
- Lift those legs...

367
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,970
- I'm lonely.
- Yes. Anything else?

368
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,767
- I'm hurt.
- Yes. And?

369
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,358
I think Adele's right.
I'm not doing anything real...

370
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,402
What would be real?

371
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,987
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

372
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,324
I don't know what's wrong with me.

373
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,910
I wanna do something important
while I'm still here.

374
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,456
That would be the time to do it. I have
a book that might help you get better.

375
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:33,460
- Better?
- It's called Getting Better.

376
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,756
- Who wrote it?
- I did. All of these.

377
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,301
- Wow, I never knew that.
- Yes. Well, wow, indeed.

378
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,472
In conclusion... Cats eat rats...

379
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,767
Within his own plumbing...
Me who am as a raw nerve...

380
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,478
Synthetic vaginal juices...
Substantial crease...

381
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,313
That's $45.

382
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,788
Five. Five.

383
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,875
Five.

384
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,879
Some fives. That's not good.

385
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,007
Keep with the flossing.
We'll see you in three months.

386
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:24,344
Six. Six. Six.

387
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,181
I'm gonna recommend
you see a periodontist.

388
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,475
He'll probably recommend
gum surgery.

389
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,109
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm so glad I finally got you.

390
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,404
- Hello, who is this?
- It's Caden.

391
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,406
Ellen?

392
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,535
It's Caden. I can't wait to see you
and Olive on the 12th...

393
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:53,624
No, I have to go.
I'm sorry, there's a party. I'm famous.

394
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,167
Have fun...

395
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,684
911, state your emergency.

396
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,895
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Ma'am?

397
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,671
Mr. Cotard?

398
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,648
Mr. Cotard.

399
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,202
You've had a seizure of sorts.

400
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,622
What does that mean?

401
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,960
Seems to be some synaptic
degradation, fungal in origin.

402
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,296
Autonomic functions
are going haywire.

403
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,299
You'll lose your ability
to salivate, cry, et cetera.

404
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,720
- Is it serious?
- We don't know. But, yes.

405
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,723
We'll get you enrolled
in some biofeedback program.

406
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,809
Maybe you can learn
some sort of manual override.

407
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,991
We should get a drink.
It would be fun.

408
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,997
- It would be weird.
- I like weird. I like you. See?

409
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,126
Anyway, I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable, I...

410
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,924
Okay, so I do
wanna make you uncomfortable.

411
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,270
And what do we do with all this?

412
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,652
You wanna come over to my place,
Cotard?

413
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,493
I won't let you off the hook this time
by saying, "Never mind."

414
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,204
Adele is only on vacation.

415
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,875
She hasn't called since she left.
It's been a year.

416
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,670
It's been a week.

417
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,091
I'm gonna buy you a calendar.

418
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,476
Okay.

419
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,106
Just for one drink.

420
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,821
Come on. Scraps for my scrapbook.

421
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,413
I can't... I really can't drink very much
because of my condition.

422
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,757
Did you put something in it?

423
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:35,178
If that's what it takes,
consider it done.

424
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,308
Love potion number 69.

425
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,856
- It's good.
- Does it make you wanna kiss me?

426
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,569
- Kind of.
- Tell me why.

427
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,281
Because I feel a lot of longing.

428
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,034
Beg a girl, why don't you?

429
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,119
- Please, Hazel.
- On your knees.

430
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,414
What?

431
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,418
I want you to beg me
on your knees for a kiss.

432
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,170
Just for fun.

433
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,966
Why am I doing this?

434
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,803
For fun, baby.

435
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,351
Will you help me
forget my troubles?

436
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,729
Oh, kiddo.

437
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,982
You don't even know.

438
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,739
- What?
- I don't know.

439
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,117
- What is it?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

440
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,871
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,501
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just...

442
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,923
I'm just really confused.

443
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,425
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,886
I...

445
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,102
I'm really sick.

446
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,189
And I think I'm dying.

447
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,820
I have a kid, and I'm married.

448
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:24,830
I just thought
this might change things, you know?

449
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:29,709
I had a good time,
and I think you're a very nice person.

450
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,756
That is just the wrong thing
to say right now, Caden.

451
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,187
You should go.

452
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,238
Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

453
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,283
Hi. You know,
I haven't heard from you in a while...

454
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,077
...and I just thought I'd call
and say hi.

455
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,079
Hi, Hazel.

456
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,921
Now. Now. Be here now.

457
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,300
Olive wanted me to ask you
not to read her diary.

458
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,053
She left it under her pillow
by mistake.

459
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,240
Dear Mr. Cotard,
it is my pleasure to inform you...

460
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,243
...that you have been named
a 2009 MacArthur Fellow.

461
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,705
It is our hope that you will use
your newly found financial freedom...

462
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,958
...to create something unflinchingly
true, profoundly beautiful...

463
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,003
...and of unremitting value
to your community and to the world.

464
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,005
- I got this MacArthur grant.
- Oh, Caden.

465
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,841
- Yeah, a lot of money.
- Know what you're gonna do with it?

466
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:04,387
Theater piece.
Something big and true and tough.

467
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,806
I'm gonna finally put my real self
into something.

468
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:11,228
What is your real self, do you think?

469
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,022
I don't know yet.

470
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,984
The MacArthur is called
"the genius grant"...

471
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,153
...and I wanna earn it.

472
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,948
That's wonderful. God bless.

473
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,451
I guess you'll have to discover
your real self, right?

474
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,161
Yeah.

475
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,290
I wanted to ask you, how old are kids
when they start to write?

476
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,335
There's an absolutely brilliant novel
written by a 4-year-old.

477
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,172
- Really?
- Little Winky by Horace Azpiazu.

478
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,966
- That's cute.
- Oh, hardly.

479
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,551
Little Winky
is a virulent anti-Semite.

480
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,930
The story follows his initiation
into the Klan...

481
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,016
...his immersion
in the pornographic snuff industry...

482
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,436
...and his ultimate degradation
at the hands of a black ex-convict...

483
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,315
...named Eric Washington Jackson
Jones Johnson...

484
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,442
- Written by a 4-year-old?
...Jefferson.

485
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,737
Written by a 4-year-old?

486
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,156
Well, Azpiazu killed himself
when he was 5.

487
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,285
- Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know. Why did you?

488
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,953
What?

489
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,955
I said, why would you?

490
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,333
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,881
Yeah, I wanna bring my production
to New York...

492
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:27,053
...to get it seen by people,
you know, who matter.

493
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,015
- The sooner the better.
- This theater, centrally located.

494
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,059
Heart of the theater district,
so, you know, great for plays.

495
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,605
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There it is.

496
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,735
- What was this used for?
- Plays.

497
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,324
- Like, theater plays?
- Shakespeare.

498
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,952
King Lear.

499
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,204
The storm.

500
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,126
You see, the idea
is to do a massive theater piece.

501
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,588
You know, uncompromising, honest.

502
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,844
Here's what I think theater is.
It's the beginning of thought.

503
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,222
It's the truth not yet spoken.

504
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,060
It's what a man feels like
after he's been clocked in the jaw.

505
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:20,732
It's love in all its messiness.

506
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,028
You know, and I want all of us,
players and patrons alike...

507
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,115
...to soak
in the communal bath of it...

508
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,119
...the mikvah, as the Jews call it.

509
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:38,792
Because we're all in the same water,
after all.

510
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:45,298
You know, soaking
in our very menstrual blood...

511
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,300
...and nocturnal emissions.

512
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,595
This is what I wanna try
to give people.

513
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,057
Okay, here you go.
Here's your salad.

514
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,770
- Here's your soup.
- Thanks.

515
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,191
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

516
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:13,076
- What are you doing?
- Salivating.

517
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,329
The biofeedback training.

518
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,168
- So I was wondering if you'd help.
- In your box office?

519
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,256
No, as my assistant.

520
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,134
I'm not sure I can work with you,
Caden.

521
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,845
I'm kind of angry.

522
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,931
I just wanna normalize it.

523
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,228
I think we'd have a lot of fun
together.

524
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,910
I miss you.

525
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,456
- Really disturbing.
- I know.

526
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,712
Dear diary, thank you
for being my new best friend.

527
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,632
My name is Olive Cotard,
and I'm 4 years old.

528
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,177
I like chocolate,
and my favorite color is pink.

529
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,724
This is pink.

530
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,479
Yeah, that's good.

531
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,564
- Next.
- Hi.

532
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,199
We'll start by talking honestly...

533
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:38,244
...and out of that,
a piece of theater will evolve.

534
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,747
I'll begin.

535
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,502
I've been thinking a lot
about dying lately.

536
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,714
- You're gonna be fine, sweetie.
- Well, I appreciate that, Claire, but...

537
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,965
You are, you poor thing.

538
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,637
Yeah, well, regardless of how
this particular thing works itself out...

539
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,890
...I will be dying.

540
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,393
And so will you.

541
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,064
And so will everyone here.

542
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,570
And that's what I wanna explore.

543
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,198
We're all hurtling towards death.

544
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,455
Yet here we are,
for the moment, alive...

545
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,375
...each of us knowing
we're gonna die...

546
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,088
...each of us
secretly believing we won't.

547
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,466
It's brilliant.

548
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,637
It's everything.

549
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,474
It's Karamazov.

550
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,481
- Stop.
- I'm just asking.

551
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,317
- You're so obnoxious.
- You're so obnoxious.

552
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,529
- You do not wanna cross me.
- Don't I?

553
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,828
Hi, Claire.

554
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,582
- Hi.
- Hazel.

555
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,585
Yeah. No, no. I know, I know. Hazel.
You're the box office.

556
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,254
- Yeah, I'm the box office.
- How are you?

557
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,673
Wonderful. You?

558
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,758
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm fine.
Thank you.

559
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,846
Actually, I'm meeting Caden here.
You know Mr. Cotard, right?

560
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,765
Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard.

561
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,893
Yeah. I'm waiting...

562
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,152
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden.

563
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,238
- Hi, Caden.
- Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.

564
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,240
Hi.

565
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,284
- This is Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

566
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,203
- Hi, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

567
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,413
Hi.

568
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,754
Well, we'll leave you be.
It's nice to see you again.

569
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,716
- Take care.
- Why am I bowing? Okay, bye.

570
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,389
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, I guess.

571
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,893
Do you like beaver...?

572
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,063
So could you tell me maybe
what it is that you want from me?

573
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,400
You know, like, from my character.

574
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,364
Well, we'll build it over time
together.

575
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,575
You know, try to find a real person,
maybe, to model it after.

576
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,078
That Hazel girl's
kind of interesting maybe.

577
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,954
- You know, like, why...?
- Although...

578
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,540
Why is she still working
at a box office at her age?

579
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,751
I don't know.
Probably not that interesting.

580
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,921
Maybe she wanted to be an actress,
but she lacked the confidence.

581
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,340
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- I'm so excited.

582
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,133
Really? Why?

583
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,430
Because I think that it's brave.

584
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:49,185
And I just feel like
I'm gonna be part of a revolution.

585
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,480
I keep thinking about Artaud,
Krapp's Last Tape...

586
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,775
...you know, and Grotowski,
for chrissake.

587
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,069
I don't know what I'm doing.

588
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,613
But that's what so refreshing.

589
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,032
Knowing that you don't know...

590
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,620
...is the first and the most essential
step to knowing, you know?

591
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,498
I don't know.

592
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,755
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

593
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,882
- Don't say that, not to me.
- Oh, sorry.

594
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,887
My mother died last night.

595
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:31,561
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
What are you doing out?

596
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,317
- This is me.
- Well...

597
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,405
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, God, did I just say "meeting"?

598
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:47,577
- I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.
- Slip of the tongue, is all.

599
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,496
Yeah, it's a Freudian slip, right?

600
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,624
I don't know how it's Freudian.

601
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:58,671
To meet, you know? Like, to meet.

602
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,721
There she met Ralph Keene.
They fell in love, married...

603
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,348
...and soon their first child,
Claire, was born.

604
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,642
I used to be a baby.

605
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,645
Claire Elizabeth Keene
was a joyous child...

606
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,523
- I'm sorry.
...the apple of her mother's eye.

607
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:22,236
She made her parents proud with her
politeness and gymnastic skills.

608
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,572
God, you're beautiful.

609
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,743
When she was 7, little Claire
was bitten by the acting bug.

610
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,662
She starred
in almost every school musical...

611
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,040
...playing Ado Annie in Oklahoma...

612
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:39,045
...Adelaide in Guys And Dolls,
and Maria in The Sound Of Music.

613
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,799
I have to fuck you. I have to.

614
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,014
There will be no other before you.

615
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,563
I'd like to buy a ticket, please.

616
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,234
- Okay. Hold it.
- That'll be $40.

617
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,323
We're not really...
We need to investigate.

618
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,244
You know, to really discover
the essence of each being.

619
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,165
You know, I think I need to work
with both of you separately.

620
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,501
Davis, I'll start with you.

621
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:24,423
I liked the beginning.
I don't wanna see a good scene...

622
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,259
"Davis, I'll start with you"?

623
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,762
There's a difference between favoring
me and pretending we've never met.

624
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,807
I mean, we've had Ariel.
I think people know that we've fucked.

625
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,603
We'll talk about your character
after we put Ariel to bed, okay?

626
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,438
Okay.

627
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,699
I think I made a breakthrough.

628
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,536
- This character is so beautiful...
- Yeah, I have to go find my daughter.

629
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,038
- Your daughter's right here.
- My real daughter.

630
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,958
- Excuse me?
- I mean, my first daughter, Olive.

631
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,128
- I have to go find her.
- Please don't do this to us.

632
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,630
She's tattooed. She's tattooed.

633
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,466
Oh, everyone is tattooed.

634
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,469
Oh, I've never seen that before.

635
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,682
- You have responsibilities.
- Yeah, I'll be quick. I'll do it quick.

636
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,853
Redundancy is fluid.
Life moves to the south.

637
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,648
There is only the now,
and I am always with you.

638
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,151
For example, look to your left.

639
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,321
Hi.

640
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:33,784
When you canceled, it freed me up,
so I'm traveling too.

641
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,833
You know,
I'm not sure I'm getting the book.

642
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:56,515
Oh, but it's getting you.
You're almost non-recognizable now.

643
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,522
Thank you.

644
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:14,075
I show you my leg. I stand close,
and you inhale my perfume.

645
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,912
I offer my ripe flower to you
and you deny it.

646
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,456
This book is over.

647
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,222
Hi.

648
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,057
I don't speak German.

649
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,476
Yeah, yeah. I may help you, mister?

650
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,063
I'm looking for Adele Cotard.
Adele Lack.

651
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,233
We must not give addresses
or other personal informations.

652
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,070
- I'm her husband.
- No, you are not her husbands...

653
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,531
...which is named Gunther
und Heinz.

654
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,200
I'm the father of her daughter, Olive.

655
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,579
I see. I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

656
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:05,668
Dear diary, Germany is wonderful.
So many friends here.

657
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,087
My new dads are great
and handsome...

658
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,506
...and brilliant directors of theater.

659
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,341
Hello.

660
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,014
You're here?

661
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,476
Yeah. I live with Adele and Olive
and Gunther and Heinz...

662
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,856
...and Uschi and Britt.
I'm everyone's nanny.

663
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,191
I wanna see my daughter.

664
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,903
- Yeah, they sent me.
- They?

665
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,158
Who are they?
Who the fuck are Uschi and Britt?

666
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,952
Yeah, they decided it's not time
to see you yet.

667
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,705
They decided? Who decided?
They had her tattooed.

668
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,249
Oh, I did that. Olive is my project...

669
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,710
She's a 4-year-old!

670
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,630
She's a fucking 4-year-old!

671
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,720
She's almost over 11 now.

672
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,391
She's my muse.

673
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,935
I love her.

674
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,900
You don't love her!

675
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,653
Where is she?

676
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,824
What did you do to my daughter?

677
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:21,011
Death comes faster than you think.

678
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,725
- That was your last patient for the day.
- Let's stop this charade.

679
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,019
I don't know
what you're talking about, doctor.

680
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,564
You're actually having an affair
off set.

681
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,440
- Palpable, huh?
- Oh, okay.

682
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,068
- Who told you?
- And it's not good.

683
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,737
- Not good, oh, okay.
- You're actors playing actors.

684
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,408
You're in this scene, you're not
just filming it. You're in this scene.

685
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,701
Just like that...

686
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,787
As you're telling him this,
you realize you're attracted to him.

687
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,414
How are you gonna let him know?

688
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,834
And the guilt you feel about telling him
about somebody else knowing.

689
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,919
Daddy, Daddy is mine.

690
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,422
Daddy can't play now, honey.

691
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,092
Daddy doesn't live with us anymore,
baby. He had to go find himself.

692
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,761
They still feel a little tight in the toe.

693
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:07,099
Have an argument.
You're having an argument. Have it.

694
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,186
- I don't buy it.
- You, sir, are a horse's ass.

695
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,898
What? Just get the fucking shoe.
You gave me two sizes too big.

696
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,902
Tom, don't turn into another person
just because I say change your action.

697
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:23,574
And this started just today?
It never happened before?

698
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,202
Okay. Good.

699
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,329
You can get dressed.

700
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,793
I mean, you're a doctor, right?
Am I dying? Can you tell me that?

701
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,588
- No.
- No, you can't tell me?

702
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,050
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me if you can't tell me?

703
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,010
- No.
- No, you can't tell me...

704
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,931
...because you're not allowed to?
- No.

705
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,750
- Caden.
- What are you doing here?

706
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,213
I was wondering
if I was gonna bump into you.

707
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,423
- You look great.
- Thanks.

708
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:25,094
- Is that a new haircut?
- Yeah. For a while now.

709
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,013
What are you doing in New York?

710
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,558
I'm here with Derek and the boys.
A mini vacation.

711
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:35,104
- The boys?
- Yeah. I thought you knew.

712
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,857
- How old?
- Five.

713
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,361
Twins. Robert and Daniel and Alan.

714
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,115
Yes.

715
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,077
They're nice names.
Where are they?

716
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:54,707
Derek took them to the Natural History
so I could shop.

717
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:01,130
It's so good to see you, Caden.
L... How are things?

718
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,717
You know, I was with Claire.

719
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,846
And we have a daughter.
But we're separated.

720
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,890
How about with you?

721
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,562
Good. I have a great job
at Lens Shapers.

722
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,649
Shapers. Great. You wear a lab coat.

723
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,739
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Hazel.

724
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,855
Hey! What are you doing?

725
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,400
- I got you.
- Let me go.

726
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,693
How I love Maria.

727
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,322
She is so much more of a father
than Caden ever was...

728
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,826
...with his drinking and unfortunate
body odor and rotting teeth.

729
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,955
I could only loathe him,
and perhaps pity him.

730
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,083
But Maria.

731
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,463
I wanna come back.

732
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:29,301
I wanna take care of you and Olive.
Ariel. Ariel. Fuck.

733
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,972
Ariel.

734
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,318
No, no, no, it's so late. Please.

735
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,694
No, no, no. Please.

736
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,990
Hello?

737
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,829
Okay.

738
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,633
My father died.

739
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,180
Oh, baby.

740
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:24,106
They said his body was riddled
with cancer and that he didn't know.

741
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,525
That he went in
because his finger hurt.

742
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,529
They said he suffered horribly.

743
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,200
And that he...

744
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,831
That he called out for me
before he died.

745
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:46,753
They said that he said
he regretted his life.

746
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,842
And they said he said a lot of things.

747
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,887
Too many to recount.

748
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,390
They said it was the longest...

749
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,769
...and saddest deathbed speech
any of them had ever heard.

750
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,856
There was so little left of him...

751
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,735
...they had to fill the coffin
with cotton balls...

752
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,362
...to keep him from rattling around.

753
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,662
I'm really sorry for your loss.

754
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,998
Thank you.
Can you excuse me a moment?

755
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,752
- Of course.
- I need to use the bathroom.

756
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,629
- All right.
- Okay.

757
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,382
God bless you and your family.

758
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,843
God bless you. Will you excuse me?

759
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:41,016
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

760
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,690
It's left five people dead.

761
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,484
Sorry.

762
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,112
- Caden?
- Hi, Derek.

763
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,573
Officials suspect arson.

764
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,326
In other news,
German pharmaceutical giant...

765
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,578
...has won its libel suit
against patients...

766
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:05,040
...claiming chromosomal damage
from use of the arthritis medication...

767
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:09,628
Will you just tell me what to do?

768
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,676
In Pakistan today, the government...

769
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:28,814
Caden, everyone has to figure out
their own life, you know.

770
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,817
I just want you to look at me
the way you used to.

771
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,404
Oh, honey, I can't anymore.

772
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,948
You know I'm sorry.

773
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:43,704
I screwed everything up,
and I don't have any courage.

774
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,457
- And I'm sorry.
- Caden.

775
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,671
- I'm okay.
- I don't want you to be okay.

776
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,759
I mean, I do, but it just...

777
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,304
It rips my guts out.

778
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,514
I'll help you through any way I can.

779
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,475
And I'll help you through too.

780
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,688
I'm fine.

781
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,024
I have Derek.

782
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,700
Okay, I'm going.

783
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,626
Honey, I'm coming.

784
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,880
Dear diary, today I felt a wetness
between my legs.

785
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,133
Maria explained to me
now I am a woman.

786
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,887
And being a woman is wonderful
with Maria to guide me.

787
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,525
Olive?

788
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,074
Olive.

789
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:53,959
Olive, it's Daddy.

790
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:59,464
Olive, it's Daddy! Olive, it's Daddy!

791
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,968
Don't fucking stare at me! Olive!

792
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:07,806
Get off! It's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

793
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:12,894
Get off! Get off!

794
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:20,402
I won't settle for anything less
than the brutal truth.

795
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,031
Brutal. Brutal.

796
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,828
Each day I'll hand you a paper. It'll tell
you what happened to you that day.

797
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,496
You felt a lump in your breast.

798
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,291
You looked at your wife
and saw a stranger, et cetera.

799
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,127
- Caden?
- What?

800
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,172
When are we gonna
get an audience in here?

801
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,924
It's been 17 years.

802
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,514
All right, I'm not excusing myself
from this either.

803
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,850
I will have someone play me...

804
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,686
...to delve into the murky,
cowardly depths...

805
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:59,024
...of my lonely, fucked-up being.

806
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,403
And he'll get notes too,
and those notes will correspond...

807
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:08,950
...to the notes I truly receive
every day from my god.

808
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,875
Get to work!

809
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,692
They fired me.

810
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,114
- I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis.
- Oh, God.

811
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,742
I didn't wash my hands.
I had pinkeye hands.

812
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,537
- Oh, God.
- I'm a stupid cow.

813
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:57,582
Fucking private Christian school
is killing us. You know, it's not cheap.

814
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,669
It's Derek's thing.
I don't believe in that shit, you know.

815
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,505
You try to be a good person.
I mean, that's all there is.

816
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,926
Do you have anything for me,
Caden?

817
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,307
I mean, I already have an assistant.

818
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:19,104
- I don't have a box office yet, but...
- Please, caden.

819
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,314
Please, Caden. I...

820
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,609
Please, Caden.

821
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,324
Sammy Barnathan?

822
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,212
Sit. Sammy Barnathan.

823
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:58,268
I don't have a rsum or a picture.

824
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,815
- I've never worked as an actor.
- Good. Tell me why you're here.

825
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,067
Well, I've been...

826
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,113
I've been following you for 20 years.

827
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,658
So I knew about this audition
because I follow you.

828
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,828
And I've learned everything about you
by following you.

829
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:21,416
So hire me,
and you'll see who you truly are.

830
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,587
Peekaboo.

831
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,009
Okay.

832
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,724
Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to
anyone else. This guy has me down.

833
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,020
I'm gonna cast him right now.
Then maybe you and I can get a drink.

834
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,606
And we can try to figure out
this thing between us...

835
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,650
...why I cried.

836
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:53,198
Because I've never felt about anybody
the way I feel about you.

837
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,203
And I wanna fuck you
until we merge into a chimera...

838
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,541
...a mythical beast with penis
and vagina eternally fused...

839
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,170
...two pairs of eyes
that look only at each other...

840
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:11,591
...and lips ever touching.

841
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:17,013
And one voice that whispers to itself.

842
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,319
Okay.

843
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:35,490
Yeah. You've got the part.

844
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,096
I've never seen your shit gray.

845
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,016
It's new.

846
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,771
That's a good boy.

847
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,781
- When is it opening?
- When it's ready.

848
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,994
- We need to get in. It's bad out here.
- Sorry.

849
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,168
You know, I was thinking
of calling it Simulacrum.

850
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,088
I don't even know what it means.

851
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:36,968
Can I have a nickel if I doesn't play
with my pee-pee no more?

852
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,262
Yeah.

853
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,142
How about
The Flawed Light of Love and Grief?

854
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,810
I'm not sure.

855
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,732
Claire, I want you to play yourself.

856
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,651
Sammy's gonna move
into your apartment set as me.

857
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,241
It would be my honor
to play your husband, Claire.

858
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,327
You're an amazing actress.

859
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,372
No, I saw you do Bernarda Alba
last year at the Roundabout.

860
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,500
Yeah?

861
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,668
That was a fun play.

862
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:15,799
Emotionally, it was tough,
but fucking fulfilling.

863
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,344
Plus, I loved working
with so many strong female actresses.

864
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,476
I'm gonna start thinking
about myself.

865
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,689
Start, huh?

866
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,028
Who is Claire Keen?
Claire Keen. Claire Keen.

867
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:41,199
- Why did we leave Adele, Caden?
- Claire Keen. Well...

868
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,203
She left us.

869
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,541
You know that better than anybody.

870
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,335
Except me.

871
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,714
An amazing artist though.
The best living artist.

872
01:08:56,882 --> 01:09:00,552
I mean, there's no one who stares
the truth in the face like she does.

873
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,555
Sweet pussy too.

874
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,976
How do you know that?

875
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,648
I read it.

876
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,073
Anyway...

877
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,703
I mean, I don't know where she is.

878
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,582
Well, maybe she's got a sublet
in New York.

879
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:36,254
Maybe she's got a retrospective
at the Met. Maybe, baby.

880
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:44,846
Why are you giving me this?

881
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:49,642
I wanna follow you there and see
how you lose even more of yourself.

882
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,688
Research.

883
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,859
You know, for the part.

884
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,445
Partner.

885
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,746
Hold it. Hold it, please.

886
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,790
Hold it, please.

887
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,504
I asked you to hold the door.

888
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:02,674
I'm sorry. I pressed the button,
but I think it was too late.

889
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,676
You didn't press it.

890
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,639
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, thanks.

891
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,185
- Are you Ellen? Ellen?
- What?

892
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,271
- Are you Ellen Bascomb?
- What?

893
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,856
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

894
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:21,985
Yes, I'm Ellen.

895
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,404
She said you should just go ahead
and get started.

896
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,865
- And don't forget to change the sheets.
- Okay, thanks.

897
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,160
Oh, sweetheart.

898
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:55,268
Adele?

899
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:05,069
Hi, Ellen. Be a doll and do the sheets
and whatever's in the hamper.

900
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,197
Your money's under the toaster.
Kisses, Adele.

901
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:12,243
P.S. Bag of stuff in bedroom closet
for Goodwill. Take what you want.

902
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,229
Went for a walk. I had to think.

903
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,948
All night?

904
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:56,788
You smell weird.
Are you wearing lipstick?

905
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,581
No.

906
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,543
What do I smell like?

907
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,631
Like bad? Like an old person?

908
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,883
I don't know.
Like mold and cleaning products.

909
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,968
Like you're menstruating.
I don't know.

910
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,762
Menstruating?

911
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,389
You tell me.

912
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:18,309
I don't menstruate. I don't know how
I could smell like I'm menstruating.

913
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,103
I wouldn't know.

914
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,533
I don't like the guy you got
to play you.

915
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,785
You don't like Sammy? Why?
I think he's good.

916
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,165
Fuck you. I'm 45 years old.
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

917
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,334
He's the best thing in the play
except you.

918
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,337
He's coming on to me.
He's grabbing my ass in rehearsal.

919
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,131
- He's your husband.
- Good, Jimmy.

920
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:50,007
He's not my goddamn husband.
You are.

921
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,593
What the fuck is wrong with you?

922
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,472
- I'm going to rehearsal.
- It's about the play.

923
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,767
- We're getting at something real here.
- That's great, you guys.

924
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,769
Beautiful, Sammy.

925
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:08,234
- Caden? Time-out?
- Yeah.

926
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,986
What's up?

927
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,948
Well, I feel we need a Hazel in here.

928
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,827
I mean, there's a whole side of Caden
I can't explore without a Hazel.

929
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:22,457
- I guess, yeah.
- I get to be a character?

930
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,041
Yeah.

931
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:33,509
Hi, Ellen.
Crackerjack job last night.

932
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:35,970
Would you do sheets again?

933
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:40,349
We had quite a fuck,
and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A.

934
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,228
Hi, Adele. Relined the cabinets.

935
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:47,565
I just wanted to let you know
I won a MacArthur Grant.

936
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,569
And I'm mounting a play which
I think is gonna be pure and truthful.

937
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,739
Best, Ellen.

938
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,581
I went for a walk. I had to think.

939
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,462
Caden, what are you doing at night?

940
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,715
I have a right to fucking know.

941
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,927
I've been going to Adele's place.

942
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,680
And cleaning it.

943
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,853
Do you have any idea
what I've given up for you? For this?

944
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,689
For you? For you?
Could you please get that?

945
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:40,785
- This looks serious. Am I interrupting?
- What's going on, Hazel?

946
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,872
I just wanted you to know
that the actress playing me...

947
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,624
...is ready to start today.

948
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,961
That's great. That's all we need
around here, is two Hazels.

949
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,630
Okay, I'll take that as my cue.

950
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,634
- Maybe you could clean her toilet.
- Maybe I will.

951
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,638
This is over.

952
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:04,058
- No, Claire...
- I'm not talking to you.

953
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,311
I didn't say I was gonna
clean Hazel's toilet. He did.

954
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:10,231
- But you thought it!
- I thought it, but I didn't say it.

955
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,318
I got an offer to do
Needleman in a Haystack.

956
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,072
And I'm gonna take it.
I want you out of the apartment.

957
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,992
The real one. You can keep this one.

958
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,660
Claire.

959
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,788
Jesus. Claire.

960
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,542
Hi, yeah, we're gonna need
a Claire replacement.

961
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,129
Claire, I didn't say it.

962
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,845
I already put out a call
for a Claire replacement.

963
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,600
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

964
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,811
Just like that?
You don't give a guy even a chance?

965
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:53,524
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl, remember?

966
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,360
I try and be fun-loving, see?

967
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,321
Sorry.

968
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,281
My analyst says
you have complexes.

969
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,867
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

970
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:06,162
- That's before my analyst taught me...
- This is the last of my stuff.

971
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,497
- Bye.
- Bye. From the top?

972
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

973
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,711
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

974
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,557
I'm sorry. Okay.

975
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,572
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

976
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,492
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to move on.

977
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,827
Just like that?
You don't give a guy a chance?

978
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,373
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl.

979
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,917
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

980
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,960
That's before my analyst taught me...

981
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,379
This is a lie.

982
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,715
Come here.
I try to be fun-loving, see?

983
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,385
- She told me your hatred of...
- Will.

984
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,554
Wall it up. All of it.

985
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,023
Claire.

986
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:23,280
Oh, Needleman.

987
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,783
All right.

988
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:31,539
Good for you with your grant.

989
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,792
Listen, I fixed up the walk-in
as a sort of bedroom if you want.

990
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,085
We'd love to have you...

991
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,046
...and you wouldn't have to schlep
all the way to Queens.

992
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:43,342
It's just a thought. Kisses, A.

993
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,438
Dear diary, I'm afraid I'm gravely ill.

994
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,943
It is perhaps times like these
that one reflects on things past.

995
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,654
An article of clothing
from when I was young.

996
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,282
A green jacket.
A walk with my father.

997
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,326
A game we once played.
Pretend we're fairies.

998
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,079
I'm a girl fairy,
and my name is Lauralee...

999
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:15,583
...and you're a boy fairy,
and your name is Teetery.

1000
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,960
Pretend when we're fairies,
we fight each other.

1001
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:22,590
And I say, "Stop hitting me or I'll die."
And you hit me again, and I say:

1002
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,469
"Now I have to die."
And you say, "But I'll miss you."

1003
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:29,180
And I say, "But I have to.

1004
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:32,683
And you'll have to wait a million years
to see me again.

1005
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,310
And I'll be put in a box...

1006
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,354
...and all I'll need
is a tiny glass of water...

1007
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,482
...and lots of tiny pieces of pizza.

1008
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:42,276
And the box will have wings
like an airplane."

1009
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,279
And you ask,
"Where will it take you?"

1010
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,491
"Home," I say.

1011
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:07,092
This is to hear.

1012
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,515
- So words... English here, yeah?
- Okay.

1013
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,564
I'm dying...

1014
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,317
...as I'm sure Maria told you.

1015
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:31,116
The flower tattoos have become
infected and they're dying.

1016
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:35,955
So I am as well. This is life.

1017
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,416
It's Maria. She did this.

1018
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,295
Maria gave me a reason to live
once you left.

1019
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,422
The flowers defined me.

1020
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,842
Your mother and Maria
took you away.

1021
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,178
I've tried for years to find you.
I didn't leave you.

1022
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,974
I want to talk to you
about your homosexuality.

1023
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,602
- I'm not a homosexual.
- Maria said you would deny it.

1024
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:02,106
Well, she's a liar. She's lying to you.

1025
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:06,819
I had the same struggle
when I first fell in love with Maria...

1026
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,446
...and we began to have dirty,
aching sex.

1027
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,866
Maria is your lover?

1028
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,494
Of course.
She introduced me to myself...

1029
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:17,955
...to my vagina and to hers.

1030
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:21,458
You have no idea how evil she is.

1031
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,128
I need to forgive you before I die...

1032
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,965
...but I can't forgive someone
who has not asked for forgiveness.

1033
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,719
- I just want...
- I have no time.

1034
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,556
I need you to ask for forgiveness.

1035
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,810
Can you ever forgive me?

1036
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,147
- For what?
- For abandoning you.

1037
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:48,319
For abandoning you
to have anal sex...

1038
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:51,405
...with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1039
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:56,493
I will, I'll say it.

1040
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:00,789
For abandoning you...

1041
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:07,796
...to have anal sex
with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1042
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,467
No.

1043
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,308
No, I'm sorry.

1044
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,775
I cannot.

1045
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:48,629
I hope you are happy, faggot.

1046
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:52,800
I'm not happy. I'm not happy.

1047
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:44,601
I've talked to you before. This is not
a play about dating. It's about death.

1048
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,937
Make it personal. Move along.

1049
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,607
He doesn't need to yell at them.

1050
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:58,490
It is a play about dating.
It's not a play just about death.

1051
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:00,659
It's about everything.

1052
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:05,289
Dating, birth, death, life, family...

1053
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,041
...all that.

1054
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,418
- This doesn't look real.
- What?

1055
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:12,046
- It's not real.
- I can't hear you.

1056
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:47,831
- Morning, Haze.
- Hi, Caden. How was your night?

1057
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,917
It was okay. Yours?

1058
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,170
Phillip was colicky.
I was up all night.

1059
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,090
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1060
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,842
- Everybody here?
- Sammy's not here.

1061
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,013
Jimmy called and said
there's some subway problem.

1062
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,682
Sorry. Sorry.

1063
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,727
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hi, Sammy.

1064
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,192
Sammy likes you.

1065
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:29,164
I need you to build this.
This is just the faade.

1066
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:31,416
It's Adele's place.
We'll be casting an Ellen.

1067
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,378
I can give you the interiors later.

1068
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,715
A few days?

1069
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:46,390
- Can I look again?
- A slight shift in perspective on this.

1070
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,979
Millicent Weems?

1071
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:03,824
- Caden, this is...
- Hazel, what do you think of this title?

1072
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:08,078
Unknown, Unkissed and Lost?

1073
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:16,628
Anyway, this is Millicent Weems.

1074
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:17,880
Have a seat.

1075
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,551
How are you at cleaning?

1076
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,597
- Very, very good at it.
- This part requires a lot of it.

1077
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:29,349
You'd be playing a cleaning lady.

1078
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:34,271
I played Egga, the cleaning lady,
in Hedda Gabler at the Roundabout.

1079
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,690
Great. Okay.

1080
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:41,528
And Mrs. Dobson in Scrub-A-Dub
at the Pantages.

1081
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:46,575
You're weirdly close
to what I visualize for this character.

1082
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:52,623
Glad to be weirdly close.

1083
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,131
Sorry, everybody.

1084
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,801
- Maurice, what's going on?
- I'm sorry.

1085
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,930
We have a couple of new guys on.
We're not in sync yet.

1086
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,557
- We good to go?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,187
I'm sorry.

1088
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:17,397
Fuck.

1089
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:22,819
Are you Ellen?
Are you Ellen Bascomb?

1090
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,488
Shit.

1091
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:26,323
Line, please?

1092
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:30,494
Ellen..."What?"

1093
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,788
Right, right. What?

1094
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:37,417
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

1095
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,461
Yes, I'm Ellen.

1096
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:45,759
Oh, dear. It's the wrong key.

1097
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,344
I'll be in, in a second.

1098
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,179
- Did you hear that?
- What?

1099
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,268
- You're breaking the fourth wall.
- This is the wrong key.

1100
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,520
- I'm supposed to open the door.
- Hold on.

1101
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:00,941
- Are you in there?
- There's no one in there.

1102
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:03,193
- Adele?
- Caden.

1103
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,654
I don't think it's... It's not quite...

1104
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:09,116
I'm jumping in the shower.
I'll be out in a second.

1105
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,704
Do you want some coffee?
I can make a fresh pot.

1106
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:18,834
Did you look at the new painting
on my easel? What do you think?

1107
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:21,503
Hey, thanks for the fuck
this morning.

1108
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,257
- People don't walk like that.
- What? Is it too?

1109
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,884
No, just walk like yourself.

1110
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:30,595
Watch. Watch this.

1111
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,224
I gotta go.

1112
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,685
Watch this.

1113
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:58,040
Where's Hazel and Sammy?

1114
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,673
Sammy.

1115
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:10,761
Sammy. Sammy.

1116
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,846
- Hi, Caden.
- What are you doing?

1117
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,767
I was being you.

1118
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,561
You know, you like Hazel,
I like Hazel.

1119
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:23,273
This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you
wanna like a Hazel, like that one.

1120
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:24,900
That's what I tried to tell him.

1121
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:27,694
No harm, no foul, Caden.
It's equity break anyway.

1122
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,072
Ten minutes, everybody!

1123
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:32,866
- Hazel.
- What?

1124
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:37,245
- You don't like him, do you?
- Yeah, he reminds me of you.

1125
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:42,167
I'm me. You don't need someone
to remind you of me.

1126
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,545
Oh, don't worry, Caden.
I like you more.

1127
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,965
I do. It's just, Sammy's fun.

1128
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:53,470
- I'm fun.
- Oh, sweetie, no, you're not.

1129
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,305
Hold on a sec. Yes?

1130
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,265
- Is this Caden cotard?
- Yes.

1131
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:59,726
This is Officer Melnin
of Schenectady P.D.

1132
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:03,313
I'm sorry to inform you your mother's
been the victim of a home invasion.

1133
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:06,316
- What does that mean?
- She is dead.

1134
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,244
Was my father standing with us?

1135
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,539
I don't know what he looks like.

1136
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,041
He's dead.

1137
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:27,963
- So he looks dead, I guess.
- Probably wasn't him, then.

1138
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:30,715
He was a big guy.

1139
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:36,138
Anyway...

1140
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:41,852
Thanks for coming with me.

1141
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,022
That's okay.

1142
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,025
I asked Hazel...

1143
01:30:49,193 --> 01:30:52,571
...but she was busy tonight,
and you're the next best thing.

1144
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:58,160
I mean, it's not
that you're the next best thing...

1145
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:01,746
...but because you play her,
it feels comforting.

1146
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,041
Does that make sense?

1147
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:12,299
Although the thing is,
off-stage you're nothing like her.

1148
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:15,719
But you play her very well, though.

1149
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:27,981
Did Hazel mention
what she was doing tonight?

1150
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,150
Because I called her house
before we left...

1151
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,904
...and her husband told me
she wasn't gonna be back till late.

1152
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:38,867
And I just thought that was weird
because she said Phillip was sick.

1153
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,578
She's having dinner with Sammy.

1154
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,164
- That's interesting.
- He's supposed to like me.

1155
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,625
I'll have another talk with him.

1156
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,841
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to the bathroom.

1157
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,597
Don't forget your phone.

1158
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:04,768
Thanks, Yammy.

1159
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,735
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1160
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,247
You can stay in my parents' room.

1161
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,215
I thought someone
would have cleaned it up.

1162
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,801
Who?

1163
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,303
I don't know. Someone.

1164
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:48,186
This is my room.
You can sleep here.

1165
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:50,480
Where are you going to sleep?

1166
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:55,735
- The living-room couch.
- Don't you want to sleep with me?

1167
01:32:57,947 --> 01:33:01,324
- It's just sex.
- Okay.

1168
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,660
If you think it's okay.

1169
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:10,667
- How can you be like that?
- I get undressed every day.

1170
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,837
In front of someone is different.

1171
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,590
I don't see why.

1172
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,758
Maybe because
you have a beautiful body.

1173
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:22,679
- Maybe that makes it easier.
- Yeah, I suppose it might.

1174
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:25,890
Do you want to fuck?

1175
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:29,185
I do. Do you?

1176
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,606
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm sorry.

1177
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:36,610
I'm very, very lonely.

1178
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:40,655
I don't...

1179
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,826
...know what's wrong. I just...

1180
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,747
I'm sorry.

1181
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,793
Do you understand?

1182
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:57,714
I mean,
can you understand loneliness?

1183
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:02,218
Yeah. I mean...

1184
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:07,265
I don't know, I feel okay, mostly.

1185
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,935
Fucking might help.

1186
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:15,148
I'm sorry.

1187
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:19,903
It's okay, I don't mind.
Take your clothes off.

1188
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:24,616
- You're very pretty.
- Thanks.

1189
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:29,454
Sometimes I wish
I could be pretty like that.

1190
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,706
What, you wish you were a girl?

1191
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:34,167
Sometimes I think
I might have been better at it.

1192
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:38,922
Interesting.
It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways.

1193
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:44,427
- Do you like guys?
- No. I only love women.

1194
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:47,764
Well, I'm getting cold.

1195
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,611
You're pretty, Caden.

1196
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:07,200
Thanks for saying that.

1197
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,746
Come to bed, pretty Caden.

1198
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,838
I shouldn't have drunk
so much fucking beer last night.

1199
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,678
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Get lunch. What are you going to do?

1200
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,471
- For chrissake.
- Good, Roland.

1201
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,014
Thanks, Caden.

1202
01:35:30,182 --> 01:35:32,392
We need to fire him.

1203
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:36,229
We don't need to fire him.

1204
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,357
Jeremy's playing to us.

1205
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,068
Tell him to talk to Donna
and we'll hear what we hear.

1206
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:45,321
Sammy's explaining too much.
It feels expository.

1207
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:48,575
It needs to be shorthand, like,
"Jeremy, big."

1208
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:52,203
Caden, can we stop a second?

1209
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:54,247
Sure.

1210
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:57,792
If Hazel's in love with Sammy,
and Caden's in love with Hazel...

1211
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,254
...there would be a big confrontation
where Caden turns to me and says:

1212
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,840
"It's obvious he's a substitute
for me."

1213
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,968
Then I think Hazel would have
a good moment where she cries...

1214
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:11,848
...or gets angry, I'm not sure which yet,
but I think it's dramatically sound...

1215
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:14,601
- That didn't happen.
- I think Hazel would do that.

1216
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,855
- But Hazel hasn't done that, Tammy.
- Caden, what do you think?

1217
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:28,156
I feel like we could try it.

1218
01:36:29,074 --> 01:36:31,117
- Great.
- Fuck.

1219
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:42,003
Let's try it. Maybe it could happen
at the director's table.

1220
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:48,051
Fuck.

1221
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:51,471
You know, Tammy's right.

1222
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,140
I don't understand
why you're with Sammy.

1223
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:58,853
He's nice, he's available,
he fucks me without crying.

1224
01:36:59,021 --> 01:37:01,022
Since when are you available?

1225
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:05,819
Derek left because of you.

1226
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:11,115
When?
How come you never told me?

1227
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:14,619
I don't know, Caden.
How come a lot of things, huh?

1228
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:19,082
Fuck. I gotta let go of the actor
who played Derek. What's his name?

1229
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:23,086
What?
That is such a romantic response.

1230
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:24,963
- I am touched.
- It's not my response.

1231
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,256
Derek is played by...

1232
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:29,759
We have enormous
budgetary concerns here.

1233
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:35,390
...Joe.
- Stop. Okay? No, just stop.

1234
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:39,811
I do not like Tammy,
and she's nothing like me.

1235
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:42,397
- How can you like her, anyway?
- She looks like you.

1236
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:45,692
- Joe Abernathy. No, she does not.
- She offered to have sex with me.

1237
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,152
- Abernathy?
- Yeah.

1238
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,947
- Was it good?
- It was nice.

1239
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,951
I'm just being honest. It was nice.
It wasn't earth-shattering.

1240
01:37:57,454 --> 01:37:58,955
- Did you cry?
- No.

1241
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,833
You're making progress.

1242
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:06,212
Okay, I cried a little before.

1243
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:17,390
Hazel, you've been a part of me
forever. Don't you know that?

1244
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,480
I breathe your name
in every exhalation.

1245
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:31,571
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

1246
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:56,095
Oh, this is the place
I stayed with Derek and the kids.

1247
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,765
- Yeah, we're almost...
- Caden.

1248
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,143
Caden.

1249
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:05,772
- Caden. Caden, look at me.
- What are you doing?

1250
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,066
Sammy, stay right where you are.
I'm coming up.

1251
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:11,027
There's nothing to talk about, Hazel.
It's not your fault.

1252
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,030
- What are you doing?
- I've watched you forever, Caden.

1253
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:17,492
But you've never really looked
at anyone other than yourself.

1254
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,035
So watch me.

1255
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:23,706
Watch my heart break.
Watch me jump.

1256
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,418
Watch me learn
that after death there's nothing.

1257
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:30,171
No more watching,
no more following, no love.

1258
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:35,343
Say goodbye to Hazel for me.
And say it for yourself too.

1259
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:38,680
- None of us has much time.
- Sammy! Come down!

1260
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:42,892
Hazel, I love you!

1261
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,811
Sammy!

1262
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,730
I didn't jump, Sammy.

1263
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:51,025
A man stopped me before I jumped.
Get up!

1264
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,238
I didn't jump.

1265
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,163
I know how to do it now.

1266
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:07,709
There are nearly 13 million people
in the world.

1267
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,752
I mean, can you imagine
that many people?

1268
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,089
And none of those people
is an extra.

1269
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:20,013
They're all leads in their own stories.
They have to be given their due.

1270
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:22,098
I know how to do it now.

1271
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,434
There are 13 million people
in this world.

1272
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:27,311
Can you imagine
how many people that is?

1273
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:31,524
None of those people are an extra.
They're all a lead in their own story.

1274
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:33,818
They have got to be given their due.

1275
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:36,362
Do you see what I'm saying?

1276
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:39,073
Come over tonight.

1277
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:44,120
Please.

1278
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,582
You know,
we could get a place together.

1279
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:52,462
- We could get a loft.
- God, Caden, that sounds nice.

1280
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:55,131
I miss my daughter.
Maybe she could come live with us.

1281
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,425
I miss Olive.

1282
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,635
And the other one.

1283
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:02,764
- I'm a bad person.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1284
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:06,642
I am. I should never have gone out
with Sammy.

1285
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,353
I was just trying to get to you.

1286
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:12,148
You can't cause someone
to kill himself.

1287
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:15,401
He was very troubled.

1288
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,653
God, Caden.

1289
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,534
I wish we had this
when we were young.

1290
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:28,664
And all those years in between.

1291
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:31,334
My heart aches so much for you.

1292
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,003
We're here, Caden.

1293
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:39,592
- I'm here.
- I'm aching for it being over.

1294
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:45,681
Yeah. The end is built
into the beginning.

1295
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:48,518
What can you do?

1296
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:52,522
- God, you're just perfect.
- I'm a mess.

1297
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:56,859
- But we fit, don't we?
- Yeah.

1298
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:09,205
It doesn't always happen
for me now...

1299
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:12,166
...because of the medication
and everything.

1300
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:16,087
- I take a lot of pills.
- It's okay.

1301
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:21,843
I'm embarrassed. I don't want you
to think it's about you or me.

1302
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,761
It's okay.

1303
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:10,433
I have a title.

1304
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:17,899
The Obscure Moon
Lighting an Obscure World.

1305
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:24,614
I think it might be too much.

1306
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:28,492
Yeah, probably.

1307
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:43,216
Sir, could you come up here,
please?

1308
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:03,778
Might be smoke inhalation.

1309
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:12,203
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1310
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:15,206
I know how to do the play now.

1311
01:44:18,168 --> 01:44:21,754
It'll all take place
over the course of one day...

1312
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:26,342
...and that day
will be the day before you died.

1313
01:44:27,761 --> 01:44:30,721
It was the happiest day of my life.

1314
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:36,477
And I'll be able to relive it forever.

1315
01:44:36,895 --> 01:44:38,854
See you soon.

1316
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:48,990
So have you got any thoughts
for today's rehearsal?

1317
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,285
I have a new title, maybe.

1318
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:55,454
Infectious Diseases in Cattle.

1319
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:03,504
The title means a lot of things.
You'll see, it means a lot.

1320
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,560
I need a Caden for my Hazel.

1321
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,688
I'd very much like to play Caden.

1322
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,026
I know that...

1323
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:28,863
I know that it would be
nontraditional casting...

1324
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:33,284
...but I think I could do it.
I think I understand him.

1325
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:35,077
I don't understand him.

1326
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:41,751
Well, Caden Cotard
is a man already dead.

1327
01:45:41,918 --> 01:45:48,758
He lives in a half world
between stasis and antistasis...

1328
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:52,636
...and time is concentrated,
chronology confused.

1329
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:58,934
Yet up until recently,
he's strived valiantly...

1330
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,230
...to make sense of his situation.

1331
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,859
But now he's turned to stone.

1332
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,614
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

1333
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:15,284
- Thanks.
- She's right?

1334
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:19,372
I didn't see that at all.
I saw it as much more hopeful.

1335
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:24,168
None of those people is extras.

1336
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:26,796
They're all leads in their own stories.

1337
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:34,470
No, this is tedious. This is nothing.

1338
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:41,394
Hi, your scene's over.
Would you leave the stage?

1339
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:44,438
- What is she doing?
- He's directing.

1340
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:47,441
Can I get you down
at the coffin there?

1341
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:50,277
She not getting the feel of you,
Caden.

1342
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:54,156
You don't move around like that.
You don't talk to people.

1343
01:46:57,702 --> 01:47:01,414
Sit on the ground there.
Okay, everybody, let's run it.

1344
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,335
Everything is more complicated
than you think.

1345
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:09,255
You only see a tenth of what is true.

1346
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:14,635
There are a million little strings
attached to every choice you make.

1347
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:17,430
You can destroy your life
every time you choose.

1348
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:21,016
But maybe you won't know
for 20 years...

1349
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:23,853
...and you may never, ever trace it
to its source.

1350
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:26,522
And you only get one chance
to play it out.

1351
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,525
Just try and figure out
your own divorce.

1352
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:35,489
And they say there is no fate,
but there is, it's what you create.

1353
01:47:36,199 --> 01:47:38,909
And even though the world goes on
for eons and eons...

1354
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:43,622
...you are only here for a fraction
of a fraction of a second.

1355
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,001
Most of your time is spent being dead
or not yet born.

1356
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:50,629
But while alive, you wait in vain...

1357
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:54,717
...wasting years for a phone call
or a letter or a look...

1358
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,219
...from someone or something
to make it all right.

1359
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:01,849
And it never comes, or it seems to,
but it doesn't really.

1360
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,852
So you spend your time
in vague regret...

1361
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:08,689
...or vaguer hope
that something good will come along.

1362
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,566
Something
to make you feel connected.

1363
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:13,068
Something
to make you feel whole.

1364
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:16,238
Something
to make you feel loved.

1365
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:19,325
And the truth is...

1366
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,870
...I feel so angry.

1367
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,915
And the truth is...

1368
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:29,919
...I feel so fucking sad.

1369
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:36,842
And the truth is, I've felt
so fucking hurt for so fucking long.

1370
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,845
And for just as long,
I've been pretending I'm okay...

1371
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:43,474
...just to get along, just for...

1372
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:46,227
I don't know why.

1373
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:51,190
Maybe because no one wants to hear
about my misery...

1374
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:54,109
...because they have their own.

1375
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:59,281
Well, fuck everybody.

1376
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,786
- Amen.
- Amen.

1377
01:49:20,428 --> 01:49:22,471
- Delightful.
- Thanks.

1378
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,764
I'm out of ideas.

1379
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:29,603
I'm dead.

1380
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:36,735
Well, I could take over as you for a bit
until you feel refreshed.

1381
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:40,781
I think you're tired, Caden.
All these years of creative work.

1382
01:49:41,324 --> 01:49:47,621
I think you just need some time
to regroup.

1383
01:49:48,456 --> 01:49:52,001
- I need to keep my hand in.
- Well, Ellen needs to be filled.

1384
01:49:52,168 --> 01:49:55,212
- What do you mean?
- Her role. Just for a bit.

1385
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:57,673
It's a choice role.

1386
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,885
I do like to clean.

1387
01:50:16,484 --> 01:50:18,360
Ellen?

1388
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:26,535
- Yes?
- Caden asked me to give you this.

1389
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:29,830
You're to keep it in all the time.

1390
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:39,715
So touched by the sadness
of Adele's neighbor so close to death.

1391
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,218
Say, "Thank you,"
to Adele's neighbor.

1392
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:45,012
Thank you.

1393
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,681
You're very welcome, young lady.

1394
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:51,226
- Now say, "Have a very good day."
- Have a very good day.

1395
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:53,729
I will indeed.

1396
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:00,235
Reach for the toilet paper.

1397
01:51:00,945 --> 01:51:03,697
Wrap some around your hand.

1398
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:06,158
Wipe yourself.

1399
01:51:11,247 --> 01:51:13,582
There was supposed to be
something else.

1400
01:51:15,043 --> 01:51:19,588
You were supposed
to have something, a calm.

1401
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,632
Love.

1402
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,676
Children.

1403
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:26,762
A child, at least.

1404
01:51:27,305 --> 01:51:29,431
Children.

1405
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:32,226
Meaning.

1406
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:42,027
Everything okay, Eric?

1407
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:47,700
- Everything is everything.
- He hates me.

1408
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:53,247
I disappointed him,
and he hates me.

1409
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:58,752
Everyone is disappointing
when you know someone.

1410
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:08,887
I remember having that picnic
with my mother. Look at me.

1411
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:10,848
Ellen, what is it?

1412
01:52:11,015 --> 01:52:13,142
I was so young.

1413
01:52:13,309 --> 01:52:16,478
I'm going to remember this moment
for the rest of my life, Mama...

1414
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,899
...and in exactly 20 years,
come here with my daughter...

1415
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:22,818
...and have exactly the same picnic.

1416
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,069
There was so much hope.

1417
01:52:24,237 --> 01:52:27,489
Baby, that the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.

1418
01:52:29,659 --> 01:52:35,122
Oh, God. Sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry.

1419
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:56,852
Where is my little girl?

1420
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:01,398
Where is my little girl?
Where is my little girl?

1421
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:14,995
Look at the night table
for a note from Adele.

1422
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:25,547
Stare out the window.

1423
01:53:26,925 --> 01:53:30,677
Remember the time she got you
to pose for one of her paintings?

1424
01:53:30,845 --> 01:53:33,430
How she told you
how beautiful you were?

1425
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:37,559
How she made you feel pretty again
for a little while?

1426
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:40,062
Think how you'll miss her.

1427
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:42,606
Stand up.

1428
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,743
Now it is waiting, and nobody cares.

1429
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:59,081
And when your wait is over,
this room will still exist...

1430
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:03,794
...and it will continue to hold shoes
and dresses and boxes...

1431
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:07,172
...and maybe someday
another waiting person.

1432
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,258
And maybe not.

1433
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:12,135
The room doesn't care either.

1434
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:30,404
Hello?

1435
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:54,720
There's nobody running the elevator
anymore.

1436
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:33,759
What was once before you,
an exciting and mysterious future...

1437
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:39,014
...is now behind you,
lived, understood, disappointing.

1438
01:55:39,515 --> 01:55:42,017
You realize you are not special.

1439
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:47,564
You have struggled into existence
and are now slipping silently out of it.

1440
01:55:47,732 --> 01:55:51,818
This is everyone's experience.
Every single one.

1441
01:55:51,986 --> 01:55:56,865
The specifics hardly matter.
Everyone is everyone.

1442
01:55:57,033 --> 01:55:58,951
So you are Adele...

1443
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:03,580
...Hazel, claire, Olive.

1444
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:09,294
You are Ellen.
All her meager sadnesses are yours.

1445
01:56:09,462 --> 01:56:14,007
All her loneliness.
The gray, straw-like hair.

1446
01:56:14,175 --> 01:56:18,136
Her red, raw hands. It's yours.

1447
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:21,515
It is time for you to understand this.

1448
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:34,027
Walk.

1449
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:43,578
As the people who adore you
stop adoring you...

1450
01:56:43,746 --> 01:56:46,748
...as they die, as they move on...

1451
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:51,420
...as you shed them, as you shed
your beauty, your youth...

1452
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:54,923
...as the world forgets you,
as you recognize your transience...

1453
01:56:55,466 --> 01:56:59,469
...as you begin to lose
your characteristics one by one...

1454
01:56:59,637 --> 01:57:01,847
...as you learn
there is no one watching you...

1455
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:05,976
...and there never was,
you think only about driving.

1456
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:10,272
Not coming from anyplace,
not arriving anyplace...

1457
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:14,317
...just driving, counting off time.

1458
01:57:14,485 --> 01:57:17,946
Now you are here. It's 7:43.

1459
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:21,074
Now you are here. It's 7:44.

1460
01:57:21,242 --> 01:57:24,578
Now you are gone.

1461
01:57:31,502 --> 01:57:33,628
Where is everybody?

1462
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:39,968
Mostly dead. Some have left.

1463
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:52,564
Would you sit with me for a moment?
Because I'm very tired and lonely.

1464
01:58:12,502 --> 01:58:14,669
I feel like I know you.

1465
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:19,758
Well, I was the mother
in Ellen's dream.

1466
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:21,426
Yes.

1467
01:58:24,388 --> 01:58:27,182
You seem a bit older
than I remember.

1468
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:29,684
That dream was quite a while ago.

1469
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:32,771
Apologize.

1470
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,773
I didn't mean to say you looked old.

1471
01:58:45,326 --> 01:58:48,120
There's everyone's dreams
in all those apartments.

1472
01:58:51,582 --> 01:58:56,670
All those thoughts I'll never know.
That's the truth of it.

1473
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,887
I wanted to do that picnic
with my daughter.

1474
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:11,977
I feel like
I've disappointed you terribly.

1475
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:16,356
Oh, no. I am so proud of you.

1476
01:59:17,358 --> 01:59:19,901
Ask her if you can put your head
on her shoulder.

1477
01:59:20,069 --> 01:59:23,238
Can I lay my head
on your shoulder?

1478
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:25,031
Yes.

1479
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:36,459
I love you.

1480
01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:41,756
I love you too.

1481
02:00:03,946 --> 02:00:06,948
I know how to do this play now.

1482
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,286
I have an idea.

1483
02:00:11,787 --> 02:00:14,331
I think if everyone...

1484
02:00:14,498 --> 02:00:16,998
Die.
