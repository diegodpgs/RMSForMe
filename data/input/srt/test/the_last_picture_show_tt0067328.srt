1
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,066
<i>President Truman will be here tomorrow,</i>
<i>so you folks in Dallas turn out.</i>

2
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>This is</i> Cowboy Rhythms
<i>on KTRN, Wichita Falls.</i>

3
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,531
<i>Here's Hank Williams' hit tune,</i>
<i>"Cold, Cold Heart."</i>

4
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,623
You ain't ever gonna
amount to nothing.

5
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,752
Already spent a dime this morning,
ain't even had breakfast.

6
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,338
Give me the chalk.

7
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,347
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?
It sticks up.

8
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

9
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,487
...after that stomping
you took last night.

10
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,114
What'd you say?

11
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,534
Could've been worse.

12
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,494
Yeah.

13
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,455
You can say that about everything.

14
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,003
A few teams have had
some luck with tackling.

15
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,839
Keeps the other team
from scoring so often.

16
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,841
Sounds too rough for me.

17
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,977
You don't care
if it was your last game.

18
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,730
You'll never get stomped
for your high school ball team again.

19
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,817
- Where's your school spirit?
- Don't know.

20
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,863
You working today?

21
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,907
The truck's being greased.

22
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,060
See, this is what I get for betting
on my own hometown ball team.

23
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,147
I ought to have better sense.

24
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,816
Wouldn't hurt if you had
a better hometown.

25
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,486
Mind pointing that
at the floor till I get by?

26
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,822
I don't want my eye poked out.

27
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,411
Don't let Billy get too far away.

28
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:53,251
You're damn more dangerous in
a pool hall than on a football field.

29
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,591
You ever heard of tackling?

30
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,276
Hey, Duane!

31
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,820
Boy, I froze my ass last night!

32
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,365
Why can't you kids learn to tackle?

33
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,297
How about taking Genevieve some
change, as you're going that way?

34
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,976
Toss me one!

35
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,733
Look, Larry, they can catch.

36
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,778
Feisty sons of bitches.
Wish they could tackle.

37
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,988
Or do something useful.

38
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,575
Team wasn't worth
a kiss-my-ass this year.

39
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,753
Fade out, Crawford. One more time.

40
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,968
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

41
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,012
I got enough problems
without you playing that game.

42
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,224
We could've run off to Mexico
with this, you know.

43
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,312
- Play the new one we heard.
- Which one?

44
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,774
Down payment on breakfast.
Let someone rich play the jukebox.

45
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,277
Nobody rich would eat here.

46
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,202
- I ain't very hungry.
- Well, I am.

47
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,037
You want the pickup first?

48
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,790
I oughtn't always get it first.
It's half yours.

49
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,375
- Go ahead.
- You sure?

50
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,378
Yes. Anyways, I got
lots of deliveries to make.

51
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,714
And I have to go clear to Ranger.

52
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,883
I'll be lucky to get back
for the second show.

53
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,974
My goodness, Sonny. Frank oughtn't
work you so late on weekends.

54
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,517
That's what I tell him.

55
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,104
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

56
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,149
Hope you don't want popcorn.
There ain't none.

57
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,485
And you missed the newsreel too.

58
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,447
The main show's done started,
so I'll just charge you 30 cents.

59
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,698
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

60
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,952
<i>I was wondering if my daughter had</i>
<i>deserted us, when I heard her voice.</i>

61
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,374
<i>Kay was our only daughter.</i>

62
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,670
<i>A father's not supposed to have</i>
<i>favourites, but when it's Kay...</i>

63
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,507
<i>- You smell good.</i>
<i>- You like it?</i>

64
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,718
<i>- What's that?</i>
<i>- An atomizer.</i>

65
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,637
<i>What'd you get? A present?</i>

66
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,888
<i>Who from?</i>

67
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>Somebody.</i>

68
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,732
I decided you had a wreck.

69
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,823
<i>What's happened? You look different.</i>

70
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,075
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

71
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>You look all lit up inside.</i>

72
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,040
<i>You're not wearing</i>
<i>your usual deadpan look.</i>

73
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>That "How'd I get</i>
<i>into this family?" look.</i>

74
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,127
<i>Father.</i>

75
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>You've been taking the vitamins</i>
<i>Dr. Gray sent you.</i>

76
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,715
<i>That's right.</i>

77
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,524
<i>I guess I'll get me</i>
<i>some of those vitamins.</i>

78
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
<i>I'll get it, Delilah.</i>

79
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>She looks kind of queer.</i>

80
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,741
Guess what?

81
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,243
What?

82
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,204
It's our anniversary.

83
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,456
What?

84
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,960
We've been going steady
a year tonight.

85
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,670
Yeah?

86
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,465
Seems like a lot longer.

87
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,428
You should've got me
some anniversary present.

88
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,556
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got.

89
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,977
You can give me the dollar
it cost me and Marlene for the show.

90
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,063
What are y'all doing
back here in the dark?

91
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,900
<i>He's coming for me soon.</i>

92
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,736
<i>I'll get your coffee.</i>

93
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,823
<i>Where'd the boys go?</i>

94
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,201
<i>Ben had some date.</i>
<i>Tommy's at basketball practice.</i>

95
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>- Bring the coffee, please.</i>
<i>- Yes, Miss Banks.</i>

96
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:26,083
I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

97
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,545
All they ever want to do
is neck anyway.

98
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,966
<i>Buckley says it's not too young</i>
<i>for a man to marry.</i>

99
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,677
<i>I didn't marry your mother</i>
<i>till I was 25.</i>

100
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,603
- Need some help, Jessie?
- Yeah, sure do.

101
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,938
- So long, Sam.
- Bye.

102
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,276
- Sure did like the picture.
- Well, good.

103
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,570
Crack your window.
Leave the motor on.

104
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,489
It's just too cold in here.

105
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,546
Your hands are like ice.

106
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,881
Put on my gloves.

107
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,445
What's the matter with you?
You act plain bored.

108
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,156
Quit.

109
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,408
Quit.

110
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,077
You said this was our anniversary.

111
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,329
Let's do something different.

112
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,624
Well, I like that. You cheapskate.

113
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,420
Didn't get me a present,
and now you want to get me pregnant.

114
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,006
My God, Charlene!
It was just my hand.

115
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,924
One thing leads to another.

116
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,719
My mama told me
how that old stuff goes.

117
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,180
We'll have plenty of time for that
when we get married.

118
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,683
You wasn't no livelier than me.

119
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:51,979
Because you ain't good-looking enough.
You ain't even got a ducktail.

120
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,273
Well, anyway, I'm done late.

121
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,275
Let's go on home.

122
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,736
Some anniversary.

123
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,699
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up.

124
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,869
I don't want to spoil
no more anniversaries for you.

125
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,371
That's the way
nice girls get treated.

126
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,665
I might've known
you wasn't dependable.

127
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,792
You wasn't even in the backfield.

128
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,463
This jacket's got a hole,
but don't ask me to sew it for you.

129
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,548
Give me back my pictures too.

130
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,052
I don't want you showing them
and telling how hot I am.

131
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,220
You wasn't very hot.

132
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,998
I hope you ain't down about Charlene.

133
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,044
- I ain't blue about her.
- What are you blue about then?

134
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,588
Ain't nobody to go with in this town.

135
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,175
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school,
and Duane's got her.

136
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,511
I'd call that his tough luck.

137
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,972
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

138
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,684
Jacy'd bring you more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

139
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,356
Did your dad give you this?

140
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,691
He needs all he's got.

141
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,071
Wouldn't hurt you to take something
from him once in a while.

142
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,533
I don't know. You and Duane
both in a boarding house.

143
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:31,453
Him with the mother and you
with the father. Don't seem right.

144
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,666
And your dad's taking
too many pills, you know.

145
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,128
But I'm no one to talk.

146
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,588
I never got on with Mama.
I still don't.

147
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,258
I hear Dan's going back to work soon.

148
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,718
I guess you'll be quitting
before long.

149
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,974
We got $4000 worth
of doctor bills to pay.

150
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:56,854
I will probably be making
cheeseburgers for your grandkids.

151
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:43,108
What are my chances this morning
of interesting you kids in John Keats?

152
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,610
None at all.

153
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,365
Joe Bob?

154
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,327
I read that poem of his
about the nightingale.

155
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,329
I didn't think it was so good.

156
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,206
Sounded like he wanted
to be a nightingale.

157
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:02,377
I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

158
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,755
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

159
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,759
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

160
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,428
Anyone can do it
if they love the Lord.

161
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,473
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so.

162
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,975
Here now, let me read you this:

163
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>When old age</i>
<i>shall this generation waste</i>

164
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,192
<i>Thou shalt remain</i>
<i>in midst of other woe</i>

165
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,494
<i>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"...</i>
<i>that is all</i>

166
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,748
<i>Ye know on earth,</i>
<i>and all ye need to know.</i>

167
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,875
Run, you little pissants, run!

168
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,921
Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

169
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,633
None of you pretty enough to be women.
Here, Joe Bob.

170
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,761
Quit flapping your arms.
You look like a damn goose.

171
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,847
Even a preacher's boy
ought to be in shape.

172
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,141
What kind of female will you ever get?

173
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,435
Tough it out!

174
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,564
Run, you little pissants.

175
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,193
All right, off the court.

176
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,740
If y'all didn't jack off so much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

177
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,617
Come here a minute, Sonny.

178
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,623
You do me a favour,
and I'll do you one.

179
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,291
Sure, coach.

180
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,547
My old lady's got to go
to the doctor tomorrow.

181
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,966
You know women.
Always something wrong.

182
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,217
I guess.

183
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,055
Take it from me. Anyway, I don't
have time to drive her.

184
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,518
Now, if you'll do this for me,
I'll get you out of civics class.

185
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,771
I'll be glad to.
The best offer I've had all day.

186
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,276
Tell her you got to get back for
practice so she won't stay too long.

187
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,736
I've got enough bills to pay already.

188
00:17:56,116 --> 00:18:01,121
" Know what the trouble is with you?
You ain't got no school spirit."

189
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,211
You need a haircut.

190
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,303
Come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

191
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm coming. Hold your horses!

192
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,689
Better watch it.
Here comes your mama.

193
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,118
We're having supper at home tonight.

194
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,871
I expect you there
in 15 minutes, you hear?

195
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,291
Okay, Mama.
I was just giving the boys a ride.

196
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>Here's a tune that's been</i>
<i>on the hit list for some weeks.</i>

197
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>Tell us the name.</i>

198
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,241
<i>What is it?</i>

199
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,159
<i>What is it, huh?</i>

200
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,745
<i>- "Shrimp Boats."</i>
<i>- You got it!</i>

201
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,084
<i>Very good, Thomas.</i>
<i>You were in on that too.</i>

202
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,586
<i>There's $120. We're going along fine.</i>

203
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,214
<i>Now we come to City Limits.</i>
<i>This is...</i>

204
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,770
Guess you hate me tonight.

205
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,858
I love you, but I love Duane too.
Even if you don't like it.

206
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,111
I don't care. I'd just hate
to see you marry him.

207
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,280
You wouldn't be rich anymore.

208
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,073
I don't care about money.

209
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,825
You're pretty stupid then.

210
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:47,620
You married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

211
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,457
Scared your daddy
into getting rich, beautiful.

212
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:53,334
If Daddy could do it, Duane could too.

213
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,045
Not married to you.
You're not scary enough.

214
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:59,466
You're rich and miserable.
I don't want to be like you.

215
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,301
Not much danger of that.

216
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,846
- You slept with him?
- Mama!

217
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,390
Go to the doctor
and arrange something...

218
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,644
...so you don't have to worry
about babies. You must be careful.

219
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,690
But it's a sin unless you're married.
You know I wouldn't do that.

220
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,901
Don't be so mealy-mouthed!

221
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,819
I thought if you slept with him...

222
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,947
...you might find there isn't
anything magic about him.

223
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,283
Then we can send you
to a good school...

224
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:26,784
I don't want to leave.

225
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,954
Why can't I stay
and go to college in Wichita Falls?

226
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,247
Because.

227
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,417
Everything is flat and empty here.

228
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,252
And nothing to do!

229
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:37,879
Can I have some of that?

230
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,298
Help yourself. Don't you have any?

231
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:43,927
Yeah, but I feel like
smelling good right now.

232
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,139
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

233
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,271
Leave your face just like that.

234
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,690
All you need is
a little eyebrow pencil.

235
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:06,449
Okay. Good night.

236
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:14,749
Just remember, beautiful, everything
gets old if you do it often enough.

237
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:19,045
So if you want to find out about
monotony real quick, marry Duane.

238
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,048
<i>Number one hit in the country,</i>
<i>right here on KTRN...</i>

239
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:24,509
<i>... your mutual station</i>
<i>in Wichita Falls.</i>

240
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:27,053

242
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:38,606
<i>I'd like to remind you that</i>

243

<i>Hello.</i>

247
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,756
- Abilene, you asleep?
<i>- No.</i>

248
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,633
Feel like company?

249
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:10,346
<i>I thought I'd drive out,</i>
<i>see how my well is coming.</i>

250
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:14,142
Drill hard.
You're better at oil wells anyway.

251
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,807
Hello, Sonny. What you want?

252
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,560
Coach said you need a driver.

253
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,064
Didn't he tell you?

254
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:06,444
No, he didn't mention it.
I thought he'd drive me himself.

255
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,738
I guess he just couldn't get off.

256
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:12,200
Let me just get the radio.

257
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,862
Is it something bad?

258
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,822
No.

259
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,408
It's something...

260
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,494
...very...

261
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,240
Thank you.

262
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,117
Here's the keys.

263
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:44,041
I guess I'd better
be getting back to school.

264
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,504
It was nice of you to drive me.

265
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,549
Well, it beats sitting
through civics, ma'am.

266
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:10,401
Wouldn't you like to come in
and have a soda?

267
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:13,237
If you can stand me
for a few more minutes.

268
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,702
I hate these northers.

269
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,767
Would you prefer milk?
Sit at the table.

270
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,561
Or you can go now if you want.

271
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,732
I was just scared to be alone.
I'm sorry I made you come in.

272
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,151
I'll take a Dr Pepper.

273
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,667
You'll never forgive me, I know.

274
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:54,505
Go on. You don't have
to stay any longer.

275
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,549
Thank you for the Dr Pepper.

276
00:27:58,884 --> 00:28:01,762
I guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

277
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,515
Why?

278
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:07,643
Coach probably don't get
to stay home much...

279
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:10,104
...during football
and basketball season.

280
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:15,609
My God, you don't know
a thing about it, do you?

281
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:27,746
You better go on
to basketball practice.

282
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,334
Thanks for the Dr Pepper.

283
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,374
- Hi, Jacy.
- Oh, hi.

284
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,084
Duane coming?

285
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,173
- You know Bobby Sheen at Wichita Falls?
- I met him at the country club.

286
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:22,384
He's having this midnight
swimming party tonight.

287
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:25,137
- You want to run over there with me?
- I can't.

288
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,972
You hear about the last one?

289
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:30,726
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

290
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,729
His folks are gone again,
so it'll be pretty wild.

291
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:36,857
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

292
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:40,402
A lot of kids from the club
gonna be there.

293
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:46,450
Gee, Lester, I'd like to go.

294
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:50,245
I'll have a big problem
with Duane, though.

295
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:54,082
Well, don't go off without me.
Maybe I can.

296
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:02,466
Hi, Duane.

297
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,301
What did Lester want?

298
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,804
Oh, Lester. He's such a bore.

299
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:16,396
- Hey, Abilene.
- What do you say, buddy?

300
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,819
Hey there.

301
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,490
Merry Christmas.

302
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:30,536
This is Jackie Lee French.
This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife.

303
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:33,080
What do you mean,
kissing her like that?

304
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:37,042
- I ought to slap your face.
- Well, why don't you just kiss my ass?

305
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,253
I never come to referee no fight.

306
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:42,047
Well, good then. Come dance with me.

307
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,008
Get yourself a drink, honey.
I'll be back.

308
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:53,767
Hi, Ruth.

309
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:38,312
<i>Wait for me outside.</i>

310
00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:52,117
- A thousand barrels of oil a day.

311
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:03,545
It's too hot in here.
Let's go outside.

312
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,964
I don't want drunks
tromping on my feet.

313
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,091
I have something for you anyway.

314
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,593
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey.

315
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:11,011
Hi.

316
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:17,893
Hi, Sonny.

317
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:19,519
Hi, Dad.

318
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,229
How you doing?

319
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,149
Okay.

320
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,234
That's good.

321
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:32,491
See you.

322
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,367
Sure.

323
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:41,792
You mean my Christmas present.

324
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:46,004
I haven't had time to get you
anything yet. I had no time to shop.

325
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:48,632
Hope you like it.
I saved for six months.

326
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:52,135
Oh, it's just beautiful.

327
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:54,763
It's just what I've been wanting.

328
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,724
You're so sweet,
spending all that money on me.

329
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:02,521
You're so sexy, Duane.

330
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,649
I wish I didn't have
to leave you tonight.

331
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,108
Well, you don't.

332
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,111
I do too.
I could just kill my mother.

333
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:15,659
She made me promise to go to a swim
party in Wichita with Lester Marlow.

334
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,663
- His folks are rich. Don't be mad.
- I ain't mad, but goddamn it!

335
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,582
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

336
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,086
- I want to stay with the man I love.
- Goddamn...

337
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,974
No, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go.

338
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,707
Why you asking my girl out?

339
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:48,460
- Turn me loose!
- When you're ready to fight.

340
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:49,669
Let's have it out!

341
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:56,051
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

342
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,635
Run along, Wichita.

343
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:01,181
I can't stand here all night
protecting your shoeshine.

344
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,650
I don't know what to do about him.
He's so crazy about me.

345
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:16,112
Nothing against Duane,
but that's a roughneck for you.

346
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:18,865
They aren't sophisticated
about these things.

347
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:22,660
Well, merry Christmas.

348
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:25,997
Come in and let's have
some punch, boys.

349
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,258
Hi, Sonny.

350
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,052
Oh, hi.

351
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,470
Want to help me?

352
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,055
Okay.

353
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,693
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

354
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:58,446
I did. We broke up
a couple of months ago.

355
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,824
Oh? Why?

356
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:02,534
Mind my asking?

357
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:05,245
I was going with Charlene Duggs.

358
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,957
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did, really.

359
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:13,044
We broke up because we didn't like
each other much to begin with.

360
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,421
I hope you're not sad about it.

361
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,508
I don't think Charlene's
near nice enough for you.

362
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:20,385
I didn't see you dancing.

363
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,137
No, I don't dance much.

364
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:14,856
Will you drive me
to the clinic again next week?

365
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,524
Oh, you bet.

366
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,118
We better not dawdle here.

367
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:41,758
Bobby.

368
00:37:42,508 --> 00:37:44,594
Hey, look! New victims!

369
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,848
Hi, Jacy.

370
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:54,270
Glad you made it. We're dressed
informally, as you can see.

371
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:56,856
You know Annie-Annie.

372
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,775
You want to join the club?

373
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:00,735
Sure.

374
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:04,238
You gotta get undressed
out there on the diving board.

375
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:06,783
So everybody gets to watch.

376
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,744
- We all did the first time.
- That's the rule.

377
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:11,662
Yeah, I did it last Easter.

378
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:13,456
Okay?

379
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:14,916
Okay.

380
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,210
Everybody out for the strip show!

381
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:22,423
Look out.

382
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:46,697
Don't pay attention to Sandy.
He's my brother.

383
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:49,742
If he gooses you,
I'll make him go to bed.

384
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,832
Goodness. I hope
I don't fall off this thing.

385
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,000
Sandy can fish you out if you do.

386
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:04,460
Duane, been looking for you.
Where's Jacy?

387
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,880
Don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. Want a drink?

388
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,216
- Where'd you get it?
- In a guy's car.

389
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,593
- He weren't looking.
- Let's do something.

390
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,929
Why don't we hunt up some pussy?

391
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,557
You wouldn't know what to do
with it if we found some.

392
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:19,809
What happened?

393
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:23,020
Lester took his girl
to a swimming party.

394
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:25,189
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

395
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:28,943
I know where's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

396
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:30,945
Why the hell not?

397
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:33,656
- A heifer beats nothing.
- Pussy's pussy.

398
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:35,574
I don't want no heifer.

399
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:41,372
- We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass.
- We oughtn't let him die a virgin.

400
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:44,250
Mama says idiot kids don't live long.

401
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,585
He ain't no idiot.
He just don't talk.

402
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,170
Bet he's still a virgin.

403
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:51,382
Hey, we ought to fix him up
with Jimmie Sue.

404
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:55,845
- It'd make no difference to Billy.
- We shouldn't try anything like that.

405
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,639
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than $1.50.

406
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,183
If that's all,
we should get her ourselves.

407
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,727
Shit! A heifer's better
than Jimmie Sue.

408
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:07,189
Get the stupid thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

409
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,942
Come on, let's get
those pants off, boys.

410
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:16,157
- You won't be a virgin much longer.
- We're gonna get you laid.

411
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,829
Grab on now. Come on, do your job.

412
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,956
Get her, Billy-boy!

413
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:30,921
This is the dumbest thing!

414
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,840
He don't even know what to do!

415
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:34,091
It worked for me.

416
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,843
Put it to her, boy!

417
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,762
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, screw it to her, boy.

418
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:40,639
Stop that yelling out there.

419
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,516
It ain't even in!

420
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,143
Goddamn...

421
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,812
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

422
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:49,440
Couldn't even wait.
Look at this mess!

423
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:02,953
You okay, Billy?

424
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:04,580
You all right?

425
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:19,428
Well, now I know.
Idiots as bad as Mexicans.

426
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:22,389
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

427
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:26,310
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

428
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,509
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

429
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:02,971
I told you not to fight with Billy.
He don't understand about fighting.

430
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:04,598
What happened?

431
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:08,060
- It weren't none of us, Sam.
- No, it was Jimmie Sue.

432
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:12,106
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

433
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:16,652
We bought him a piece of ass. Thought
he was tired of being a virgin.

434
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,322
She got mad about something
and bloodied his nose.

435
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:24,451
You boys get on out of here.

436
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,204
I don't want to have no more
to do with you.

437
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:30,541
Scaring a poor, unfortunate
creature like Billy...

438
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:33,001
...just so you could
have a few laughs.

439
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,839
I've been around
that trashy behaviour all my life.

440
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:39,717
I'm getting tired
of putting up with it.

441
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:42,928
You can stay out of
this pool hall, my café...

442
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:45,389
...and my picture show too.

443
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,143
I don't want no more of your business.

444
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,856
We didn't mean for anything
bad to happen, Sam. We...

445
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:57,776
You didn't even have
the decency to wash his face.

446
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:23,552
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

447
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:27,890
Can he?

448
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:41,153
Lucky I fell asleep. I'd hate
not being able to shoot no pool.

449
00:45:58,086 --> 00:45:59,796
You sure he won't come?

450
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:03,759
You know he won't.
He's starting basketball practice.

451
00:47:54,578 --> 00:47:55,954
It's all right.

452
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:21,665
I'm sorry I cried.

453
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:25,418
Just scared, I guess.

454
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:28,964
He ain't gonna come.

455
00:49:29,506 --> 00:49:31,925
They're probably
running plays right now.

456
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:34,344
No, not scared of that.

457
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:39,224
Scared I could never do this,
I guess.

458
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:44,396
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

459
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:48,441
How could you like me?

460
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:50,485
I like you.

461
00:49:53,488 --> 00:49:54,948
I'm glad.

462
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:54,275
Come on in. I ain't gonna
throw bottles at you.

463
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:00,782
What've you been doing?
You lost weight.

464
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:03,910
Ain't had any of
your cheeseburgers in weeks.

465
00:52:04,202 --> 00:52:06,329
Come on. I'll fix you one.

466
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:10,416
Even though that wasn't a nice thing
y'all done to Billy.

467
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,460
You can't blame Sam.

468
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:14,754
- Was that your idea?
- No.

469
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:16,047
- Duane's?
- Huh?

470
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:18,299
He was there, wasn't he?

471
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,636
He didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

472
00:52:24,764 --> 00:52:27,892
Don't worry, I won't tell on him.
I should, though.

473
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,770
Sure smells good.

474
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,981
One thing I know for sure.

475
00:52:33,189 --> 00:52:36,818
You can't sneeze here without
somebody offering a handkerchief.

476
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:38,945
- What you mean?
- Nothing.

477
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:43,533
It's an awful small town
for any kind of carrying on.

478
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:46,035
Don't forget to put onions on.

479
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:49,330
And some people got a lot of guns.

480
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:56,212
All right, you don't need
my advice anyway.

481
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,008
Why don't you go play a record?
These'll be done in a minute.

482
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,664
Just come in to say hello
to Genevieve.

483
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,379
Sonny.

484
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,674
Food's getting cold.

485
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,561
What you grinning about?

486
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,564
Chicken-fry me a steak.
Try to use meat this time.

487
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:07,909
I heard about
the ball game last night.

488
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:11,370
121 to 14.

489
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:13,623
Must be pretty near a record.

490
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,752
Sam.

491
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:19,587
I'm sorry.

492
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:24,425
I reckon y'all need glasses.

493
00:54:35,436 --> 00:54:37,605
Now, hold still.

494
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:40,733
Want some more cookies?

495
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,861
- More milk?
- I'm full.

496
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:56,165
How come you've stayed with the coach?

497
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:58,084
You don't like him much.

498
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:00,836
I wasn't brought up
to leave a husband.

499
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:02,838
I guess that's why.

500
00:55:03,172 --> 00:55:05,341
Maybe I was just scared to.

501
00:55:06,425 --> 00:55:09,387
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

502
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,389
What's your favourite colour?

503
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:12,848
I don't know. Blue.

504
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:15,977
- Maybe I'll repaper it.
- Why'd you marry him?

505
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:18,521
I don't know.
My mother didn't like him.

506
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:20,356
Maybe that was it.

507
00:55:21,023 --> 00:55:22,733
Well, I was 20 years old.

508
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:27,029
I thought hairy-chested
football coaches were about it.

509
00:55:27,363 --> 00:55:29,907
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

510
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,659
A blue one.

511
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,663
What you think he'd do if he found us?

512
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:37,665
Shoot us, probably.

513
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:41,627
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

514
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:03,941
I thought you boys wanted to fish.
Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

515
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:12,825
I don't think there's anything
here except turtles.

516
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:15,911
That's what I like about it,
tell you the truth.

517
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,331
- Want to try one?
- Sure.

518
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:24,378
I never liked to clean fish
or eat them either.

519
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,256
You spend half your time
picking out bone.

520
00:56:29,759 --> 00:56:32,386
I just come out here
to get a little scenery.

521
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:35,014
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

522
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,229
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

523
00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:48,986
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it.

524
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:51,238
Or a prickly pear neither.

525
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,908
I used to own this land, you know.

526
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:58,037
First time I watered a horse
at this tank...

527
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,498
...was more than 40 years ago.

528
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:05,002
I reckon the reason
I drag you out here is...

529
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:09,423
...l'm as sentimental as the next
fellow when it comes to old times.

530
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:15,763
Old times.

531
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:19,433
I brought a young lady
swimming out here once...

532
00:57:19,725 --> 00:57:21,727
...more than 20 years ago.

533
00:57:24,772 --> 00:57:27,733
It was after my wife
had lost her mind.

534
00:57:27,983 --> 00:57:29,652
And my boys was dead.

535
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:36,867
Me and this young lady
was pretty wild, I guess.

536
00:57:37,827 --> 00:57:39,620
In pretty deep.

537
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:46,836
We used to come here on horseback
and swim without no bathing suits.

538
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:53,801
One day she wanted to swim
the horses across this tank.

539
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:57,304
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

540
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:01,642
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

541
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,061
She did.

542
00:58:05,563 --> 00:58:08,941
This old horse I was riding
didn't want to take the water.

543
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:12,820
But she was always looking
for something to do like that.

544
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:15,739
Something wild.

545
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:20,953
I bet she's still got
that silver dollar.

546
00:58:23,622 --> 00:58:25,332
Whatever happened to her?

547
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,586
She growed up.

548
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:31,839
She was just a girl then, really.

549
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:36,176
Let me help you with that.

550
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:40,556
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

551
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:44,727
She was already married.

552
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:53,402
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

553
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:55,863
...like so many
young married folks are.

554
00:58:56,572 --> 00:58:59,325
I thought they'd change
with some age...

555
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,619
...but it didn't turn out that way.

556
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:04,622
- Is being married always so miserable?
- Not really.

557
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:07,541
About 80 percent of the time,
I guess.

558
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:13,505
We ought to go to
a real fishing tank next year.

559
00:59:13,756 --> 00:59:17,134
It don't do to think
about things like that too much.

560
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:21,972
If she was here,
I'd probably be just as crazy now...

561
00:59:22,222 --> 00:59:25,017
...as I was then
in about five minutes.

562
00:59:25,642 --> 00:59:27,394
Ain't that ridiculous?

563
00:59:29,772 --> 00:59:31,732
No, it ain't really.

564
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:36,195
Being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

565
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:41,867
Being a decrepit old bag of bones,
that's what's ridiculous.

566
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:43,827
Getting old.

567
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:37,798
I'm glad I wasn't on fire.

568
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:41,385
I'd have burned to death
before you got one button undone.

569
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:43,804
I'm going to get a drink of water.

570
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:55,023
I wondered where you went.
Annie-Annie asleep?

571
01:00:55,357 --> 01:00:56,733
Yeah.

572
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:12,791
Nice.

573
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,251
You a virgin?

574
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:17,004
Guess I am.

575
01:01:18,213 --> 01:01:19,256
Too bad.

576
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:23,594
- I don't want to be, though.
- I don't blame you.

577
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:26,054
Come see me when you're not.

578
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:54,708
Why don't we just go someplace?
I'm sick and tired of this town.

579
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:57,169
- You're my only friend.
- Go and stay gone?

580
01:01:57,377 --> 01:01:59,504
Except Jacy. No, I don't know.

581
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:03,508
Hey, we go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

582
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:06,970
- Would the pickup make it?
- Yeah. How much money you got?

583
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:08,347
Thirty bucks, about.

584
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:11,350
Well, I got 40.
We can make it on that. Come on!

585
01:02:13,477 --> 01:02:14,686
You guys want...

586
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,230
- Where you going?
- Mexico.

587
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:18,398
Where?

588
01:02:25,072 --> 01:02:28,492
Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

589
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:30,660
- Where did you say?
- Mexico.

590
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:33,163
- It's about the wildest.
- All the way down.

591
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:37,793
You going all the way to Mexico
tonight in this old heap of junk?

592
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:39,294
My God!

593
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:42,672
Reckon the town will get along
without us till Monday?

594
01:02:42,881 --> 01:02:43,882
I reckon.

595
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:46,843
If I was young enough,
I'd go with you.

596
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:49,554
- Need any money?
- No, we got plenty.

597
01:02:50,263 --> 01:02:53,809
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

598
01:02:54,476 --> 01:02:57,729
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts sometimes.

599
01:02:57,938 --> 01:02:59,231
Thanks, Sam.

600
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:02,776
Try not to drink too much
of that buggy water.

601
01:03:02,984 --> 01:03:05,821
We'll just drink beer and tequila.

602
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:10,409
You catch the clap, you'll wish
you hadn't drunk nothing.

603
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,089
Oh, well.

604
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:25,966
We'll see you.

605
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:27,926
- Thank you.
- So long.

606
01:03:59,457 --> 01:04:00,876
Hey, wake up!

607
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:02,377
We're back.

608
01:04:04,379 --> 01:04:07,299
My stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more Tums?

609
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:11,261
You ate them all
before we got to San Antonio.

610
01:04:12,512 --> 01:04:16,099
Genevieve will have something.
My stomach don't feel so good.

611
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:19,895
Closed.

612
01:04:20,478 --> 01:04:21,938
Closed?

613
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:26,192
I ain't never seen her closed before.

614
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,486
No, not even for Christmas.

615
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:33,366
Maybe Sam will have something.
I'm sick.

616
01:04:56,097 --> 01:04:57,849
Well, it ain't that early.

617
01:04:58,475 --> 01:05:00,185
Must be some kind of holiday.

618
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:02,687
Sam don't close on holidays.

619
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:05,273
Maybe he had to go someplace.

620
01:05:08,943 --> 01:05:10,862
Let's go ask Andy.

621
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:27,420
- Somebody will steal the town.
- Where is everybody?

622
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:31,633
- Asleep. Everybody that's got sense.
- Why'd Sam close the café?

623
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:34,928
Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you?

624
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:36,846
Gone to Mexico.

625
01:05:37,263 --> 01:05:39,307
- You don't know about it.
- What?

626
01:05:39,516 --> 01:05:41,184
Sam died yesterday morning.

627
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:44,145
Died?

628
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,022
Yep. Quite a blow.

629
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:49,901
Keeled over one of
the snooker tables, had a stroke.

630
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,654
Sam the Lion?

631
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,989
Yep. Sam's dead.

632
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:57,033
He was quite a fellow.

633
01:05:59,077 --> 01:06:02,247
He had his own way of doing things,
that's for sure.

634
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:07,252
They found his will.
Craziest thing you ever heard.

635
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:11,423
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

636
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:15,218
He left Genevieve the café.

637
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:18,513
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

638
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:21,641
Left the picture show
to old Miss Mosey.

639
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:25,478
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

640
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,939
And the craziest thing of all...

641
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:32,152
...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton,
the preacher's boy.

642
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:34,946
Beats all I ever heard of.

643
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:37,949
He could just as easily
left that to me.

644
01:06:38,158 --> 01:06:41,870
I deserve it at least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

645
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:45,415
Anyhow, it's done.

646
01:06:45,665 --> 01:06:47,709
They're burying him tomorrow.

647
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:10,685
Come in.

648
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:28,077
- I love you.
- I love you too.

649
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,943
Oh, Duane, hurry.

650
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:37,563
What's wrong, honey?

651
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:41,067
I don't know.

652
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:45,112
That tickles.
I can't stand to be tickled.

653
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:57,208
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna do it?

654
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:58,918
I don't know what's wrong.

655
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:02,755
How could anything be wrong?
Just go on and do it.

656
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:08,386
What's the matter with you?

657
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:11,138
I don't know, something's happened.

658
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,308
Get off a minute!
You might fall and mash me.

659
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,143
I don't know what happened.

660
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:19,146
It was Mexico.
No telling what you got down there.

661
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:21,732
I hate you!
I don't know why I dated you.

662
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:23,901
I don't know what happened.

663
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:29,240
Put your clothes on.
You think I want to look at you naked?

664
01:11:31,325 --> 01:11:34,120
I knew you couldn't do it.
I'll always be a virgin!

665
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:36,414
What do we say?
The whole class knows.

666
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:39,083
I want to cry.
You're the meanest boy ever.

667
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:41,502
My mother was dead-right about you.

668
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,921
I don't know what happened.

669
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,091
Don't go out there!
We haven't had time to do it.

670
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:50,052
I don't want anyone to know.
You better not tell.

671
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:53,305
You just pretend it was wonderful!

672
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,975
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.

673
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:59,019
If you say that again, I'll bite you!

674
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:21,625
Tell us about it. What was it like?

675
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:27,131
I just can't describe it.

676
01:12:27,506 --> 01:12:30,092
I just can't describe it in words.

677
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:17,348
I can do it now. I know I can.

678
01:13:51,924 --> 01:13:55,177
Quit prissing! I don't think
you did it right anyway.

679
01:14:05,646 --> 01:14:06,814
Come on.

680
01:14:17,074 --> 01:14:20,411
It's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

681
01:14:30,295 --> 01:14:32,464
I never seen one as nice.

682
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:47,146
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Jacy?

683
01:14:47,354 --> 01:14:49,023
What's on your feeble mind?

684
01:14:49,231 --> 01:14:50,983
Same as been. I want a date.

685
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:54,278
Why don't you just go back to Mexico?

686
01:14:54,486 --> 01:14:56,864
I guess girls are easier
to please there.

687
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:59,116
Just go with me one more time.

688
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:00,826
<i>You can at least see me.</i>

689
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,495
Pester someone else.
I got a new boyfriend.

690
01:15:03,704 --> 01:15:05,748
<i>- I can't be talking to you.</i>
- Who?

691
01:15:05,956 --> 01:15:07,541
Bobby Sheen, of course.

692
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:11,128
- You crazy?
<i>- I certainly am not.</i>

693
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:15,048
I guess I wanted to go with him
all along and never realized it.

694
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,885
Maybe we'll see you
in Wichita sometime.

695
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,319
Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell!

696
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:48,957
I hate to see you go.

697
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,460
I don't got a goddamn thing
to stay for.

698
01:15:51,668 --> 01:15:54,671
Roughnecks say you can get a job
in Odessa anytime.

699
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,174
Come on back if you don't.

700
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,731
You hear they busted up, let me know.

701
01:16:41,134 --> 01:16:43,679
<i>Why don't we watch the movie?</i>

702
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:49,935
Hi, I didn't hear you.

703
01:16:50,394 --> 01:16:51,395
Gene home?

704
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:54,314
No, he and Mama went to the club.

705
01:16:59,486 --> 01:17:02,030
What are you doing home
on a Saturday night?

706
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,993
Bobby Sheen ran off and got married.

707
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:10,330
Annie-Annie Martin.

708
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:16,295
Want me to turn the TV off?

709
01:17:16,503 --> 01:17:20,257
No, I'm gonna go play pool.
Tell your dad the well came in okay.

710
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:24,720
I wish I could go to the pool hall.
I've always wanted to.

711
01:17:24,928 --> 01:17:27,889
It's terrible, the things
girls aren't allowed to do.

712
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:32,811
Well, hell, come on.
I'll show you the pool hall.

713
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,313
Aren't people there?

714
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,232
If there are,
they'll be in back asleep now.

715
01:17:37,441 --> 01:17:40,527
Won't bother us. I got my own key.

716
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:43,655
Okay, I will then.

717
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:02,215
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

718
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:06,649
What a night. I never thought
something like this would happen.

719
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:10,361
How about hopping out?

720
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:48,316
He's just awful!
Why do you fool with him?

721
01:21:48,525 --> 01:21:51,319
- Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he?
- He sure is.

722
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:53,488
Your daddy's a very nice man.

723
01:21:53,696 --> 01:21:56,366
I ought to give Abilene hell
instead of him.

724
01:21:56,616 --> 01:21:59,911
Bobby was the last one.
I'm just gonna be an old maid.

725
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:03,957
That's just the way it goes.
You win a few, you lose a few.

726
01:22:04,207 --> 01:22:05,291
What do you do?

727
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,961
Nothing's ever the way
it's supposed to be.

728
01:22:08,169 --> 01:22:09,671
You're right. Come on.

729
01:22:13,424 --> 01:22:17,554
I want to tell you something.
What I've done hasn't worked out well.

730
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:21,641
I think maybe we better think
of something else for you.

731
01:22:23,393 --> 01:22:26,729
I guess Ruth Popper's got
about as good a setup as anyone.

732
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:30,775
Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably
good-looking and he's young.

733
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:34,195
Don't you know?
It's been going on about six months.

734
01:22:34,404 --> 01:22:37,240
- I thought you kids knew everything.
- That's silly!

735
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:38,700
She's 40 years old.

736
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:41,578
So am I, honey.
It's kind of an itchy age.

737
01:22:41,828 --> 01:22:43,371
Want an orange?

738
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:45,331
I don't believe it.

739
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,793
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

740
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:56,259
Pretty easy shot, sheriff.

741
01:23:04,976 --> 01:23:06,394
Sheriff, we got trouble.

742
01:23:08,396 --> 01:23:11,482
Goddamn you, Monroe!
You made me scratch.

743
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:15,612
Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's
little girl's been kidnapped.

744
01:23:15,987 --> 01:23:19,157
The preacher's boy
put her in his car two hours ago.

745
01:23:19,449 --> 01:23:23,453
What the hell? Maybe Joe Bob
just give her a ride home.

746
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:26,247
Be doing her a favour
in this hot weather.

747
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:29,125
Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

748
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:31,002
I just know she's not home.

749
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,755
They was seen headed toward Olney.

750
01:23:33,963 --> 01:23:36,591
Mrs. Clarg's afraid
that Joe Bob might be...

751
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:40,053
Gonna molest her or something.

752
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:42,221
You and these boys come with us.

753
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:46,100
If that's the way it is,
no telling what we'll find.

754
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:14,170
Molly!

755
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:21,219
Get him! Ain't you going to?

756
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,054
Here's my little girl.

757
01:24:23,262 --> 01:24:26,140
He's the one that done it.
Why don't you get him?

758
01:24:26,349 --> 01:24:29,185
If my husband was here,
he'd kill him dead.

759
01:24:34,774 --> 01:24:37,902
What'd you do to that child?
We know you done something.

760
01:24:38,194 --> 01:24:39,487
Come on.

761
01:24:42,323 --> 01:24:43,616
Filthy!

762
01:24:43,825 --> 01:24:47,662
Here now, grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

763
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,709
It's the Lord's justice, son.

764
01:24:53,918 --> 01:24:56,546
You'll suffer with the murderer
and the thief.

765
01:24:56,754 --> 01:25:00,633
Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town.
We gotta get this man to jail.

766
01:25:10,518 --> 01:25:13,312
- Doctor said he did nothing.
- Never had the guts.

767
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:16,899
- Preacher's boy.
- Sheriff figured he done something.

768
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:26,576
Isn't it terrible, Sonny?
Did you see anything?

769
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:28,995
Nothing to see except Mrs. Clarg.

770
01:25:29,203 --> 01:25:31,747
If she had a gun,
she might've killed us all.

771
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:33,499
Joe Bob didn't do nothing.

772
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:37,044
He must've done something.
It scares me to death.

773
01:25:37,253 --> 01:25:40,673
You never can tell when something
terrible is gonna happen.

774
01:25:41,924 --> 01:25:43,843
It's okay. They got him now.

775
01:25:44,093 --> 01:25:45,887
I called you before.

776
01:25:46,846 --> 01:25:47,847
You did?

777
01:25:48,806 --> 01:25:52,435
I felt lonesome. Thought you might
want to drive around.

778
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:58,232
Well, I'm supposed to be someplace.

779
01:25:58,482 --> 01:26:02,320
I'm still a little scared.
Please take me riding.

780
01:26:08,117 --> 01:26:09,452
Where will we drive?

781
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,772
Ever hear from Duane?

782
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,190
Got a postcard.

783
01:26:39,565 --> 01:26:42,109
I really feel sad about that.

784
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:45,946
He makes 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

785
01:26:46,947 --> 01:26:51,327
I'll always be a little in love with
Duane. We had too much against us.

786
01:26:52,203 --> 01:26:54,830
It wasn't easy
being the one to break up.

787
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:26,695
- Sonny?
- What?

788
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:24,044
Not here.

789
01:28:24,253 --> 01:28:27,173
I'm too old for screwing in cars.

790
01:28:30,426 --> 01:28:32,386
I don't like to hurry.

791
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:36,974
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

792
01:28:37,308 --> 01:28:39,643
I'm afraid to.
My folks are watching me.

793
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:42,271
They know I don't want
to go to college.

794
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,190
They might think we'll run off
and get married.

795
01:28:47,026 --> 01:28:49,278
We'll do it when it's safe.

796
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,489
We got all summer.

797
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:47,461
- Hey, Duane.
- Hey, buddy!

798
01:29:49,004 --> 01:29:50,255
You turned roughneck.

799
01:29:50,464 --> 01:29:53,050
Had to so I could keep
the pool hall open.

800
01:29:53,258 --> 01:29:55,094
- When did you get in?
- About 2:00.

801
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,137
I thought I'd surprise you.

802
01:29:58,806 --> 01:29:59,848
Is this yours?

803
01:30:00,057 --> 01:30:03,602
How about that?
38,000 miles and she runs like new.

804
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,646
- Do you want a beer?
- Not me.

805
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,607
That's all I eat
for breakfast anymore.

806
01:30:08,816 --> 01:30:10,818
Hey, sure is a nice car.

807
01:30:11,068 --> 01:30:14,947
I like to drive it so much, I thought
I'd drop home for the weekend.

808
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:19,910
You can't take too good care
of a car like this.

809
01:30:21,036 --> 01:30:22,830
I wash her every week.

810
01:30:23,038 --> 01:30:24,498
It looks great.

811
01:30:25,332 --> 01:30:26,375
Hear about Joe Bob?

812
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,919
I always knew he was crazy.

813
01:30:29,169 --> 01:30:32,881
He didn't do nothing, except get her
to take her underpants off.

814
01:30:33,507 --> 01:30:35,134
He's out of jail now.

815
01:30:36,218 --> 01:30:38,220
You still screwing that old lady?

816
01:30:39,513 --> 01:30:42,182
No. Yeah.
I've been kind of busy.

817
01:30:42,891 --> 01:30:45,144
I seen old Leroy last week.

818
01:30:45,436 --> 01:30:48,021
He thought you and Jacy
been going together.

819
01:30:48,647 --> 01:30:50,023
Yeah, we have, a little.

820
01:30:50,232 --> 01:30:53,694
She's been bored, so sometimes
we go eat Mexican food.

821
01:30:53,986 --> 01:30:56,280
I hear that ain't all you been eating.

822
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:00,659
Whoever told you that don't know
what he's talking about.

823
01:31:00,868 --> 01:31:02,744
I been going with her. Why not?

824
01:31:02,953 --> 01:31:05,956
I never said I blamed you for it.
I don't much.

825
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,042
I never thought you'd do that.
We was friends.

826
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:12,629
We are. What you so mad for?
I never done nothing to you.

827
01:31:12,838 --> 01:31:15,382
- Screwing my girl ain't nothing?
- I ain't.

828
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:18,093
- Hell, you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

829
01:31:18,343 --> 01:31:20,012
- She's not your girl.
- She is!

830
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,265
- You don't live here no more.
- That makes no difference!

831
01:31:23,473 --> 01:31:26,768
I'm getting her back.
She'll marry me someday.

832
01:31:26,977 --> 01:31:29,188
- She won't.
- We're meant to get married.

833
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:30,898
She's off to college soon.

834
01:31:31,106 --> 01:31:34,443
I doubt I'll get to go with her
myself, once she gets off.

835
01:31:34,651 --> 01:31:37,654
I didn't think it could hurt
to go with her this summer.

836
01:31:37,863 --> 01:31:40,407
- She'll never marry you.
- Don't tell me she won't!

837
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:46,121
She'd never let you screw her.
I was just seeing how honest you was.

838
01:31:46,371 --> 01:31:49,541
Jacy'd never let you.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

839
01:31:50,334 --> 01:31:53,003
You never even screwed Charlene
all that time.

840
01:31:53,212 --> 01:31:55,464
Course I didn't! You know why?

841
01:31:55,672 --> 01:31:58,800
Because you had the pickup
all the time Saturday night.

842
01:31:59,009 --> 01:32:00,719
I didn't have time to screw her.

843
01:32:00,928 --> 01:32:03,805
I could've done it in five minutes
without a pickup.

844
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:07,351
She only went with you because
you was in the backfield...

845
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:11,396
...and I was in the line.
- What are you saying? We was in love.

846
01:32:11,605 --> 01:32:14,775
You was. She likes me as much
as she ever liked you.

847
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:17,861
- That's a lie.
- I'll stay with her all night too.

848
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,529
- She promised.
- You won't.

849
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:20,864
Why shouldn't I?

850
01:32:21,073 --> 01:32:24,618
She told me you couldn't do it
that time in Wichita Falls.

851
01:32:47,599 --> 01:32:49,017
What happened?

852
01:32:54,064 --> 01:32:57,150
<i>This is your</i> Turntable Matinee
<i>on KTRN...</i>

853
01:33:02,197 --> 01:33:04,408
<i>Now here's Hank Williams.</i>

854
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:08,578
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

855
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:23,093
Could you tell her I'm asleep?

856
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,053
Please?

857
01:33:25,303 --> 01:33:26,638
All right.

858
01:33:52,956 --> 01:33:54,166
That too cold?

859
01:33:54,374 --> 01:33:55,917
No, it's great.

860
01:33:57,752 --> 01:34:00,464
Say, I hear Duane joined the Army.

861
01:34:00,714 --> 01:34:02,674
Good place for him too.

862
01:34:02,924 --> 01:34:05,343
He didn't mean to hit me
with the bottle.

863
01:34:05,552 --> 01:34:08,305
That boy's always had
meanness in him.

864
01:34:08,889 --> 01:34:12,350
Jacy's the kind of girl that
brings out the meanness in a man.

865
01:34:12,559 --> 01:34:14,478
She's just like her grandmother.

866
01:34:17,147 --> 01:34:20,817
I hadn't ought to talk about them.
We was all good friends once.

867
01:34:21,902 --> 01:34:24,196
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

868
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:27,824
He and Lois used to live
in this one-room place...

869
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:29,910
...over the newspaper office.

870
01:34:30,327 --> 01:34:34,080
Lois couldn't afford a flour sack,
much less a mink.

871
01:34:36,374 --> 01:34:39,377
I've always had
a soft spot for her, though.

872
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:44,549
I wondered a lot of times
what would've happened...

873
01:34:44,799 --> 01:34:47,469
...if my Dan had made
the strikes that Gene made.

874
01:34:47,677 --> 01:34:50,180
They offered that rig to him first.

875
01:34:54,142 --> 01:34:57,187
Dan Morgan never took a chance
in his life.

876
01:34:58,146 --> 01:34:59,856
Do you wish y'all had made it?

877
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:06,446
Sure, I wish we'd made it.

878
01:35:08,823 --> 01:35:12,285
I guess the Army won't take me
now I just got one good eye.

879
01:35:12,494 --> 01:35:14,788
You want to go to Korea
and get killed?

880
01:35:15,038 --> 01:35:19,292
You ain't got your senses back yet,
what few you ever had.

881
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:23,171
The café won't run itself.
You rest up now.

882
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,632
Here's for the cheeseburger.

883
01:35:25,882 --> 01:35:28,635
I'll bring your change
when I bring your supper.

884
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,793
Come on in.

885
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,595
I was so worried. I had to see you.

886
01:36:12,804 --> 01:36:14,472
I've been missing you.

887
01:36:14,723 --> 01:36:17,767
And I'm a lot better than I was.
Here, sit down.

888
01:36:18,268 --> 01:36:22,105
You can't believe how famous we are.
We're all anyone talks about.

889
01:36:22,313 --> 01:36:24,774
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I want us to get married.

890
01:36:25,525 --> 01:36:27,485
- What?
- I really do.

891
01:36:27,736 --> 01:36:30,238
- Get married?
- Just as soon as you want to.

892
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:33,158
- Don't you want to?
- Oh, yeah.

893
01:36:33,742 --> 01:36:37,120
The town will be knocked for a loop.
They'll never forget it.

894
01:36:37,328 --> 01:36:38,830
Ain't you going to college?

895
01:36:39,038 --> 01:36:42,542
I don't care about that.
I love you. That's more important.

896
01:36:43,543 --> 01:36:47,672
You were so dear to fight for me. My
folks won't like it but we'll run off.

897
01:36:47,881 --> 01:36:49,674
- They'll kill us.
- No, they won't.

898
01:36:49,883 --> 01:36:51,801
- They'll kill me.
- They'll get over it.

899
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,845
You work for Daddy now anyway.

900
01:36:54,053 --> 01:36:57,182
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as I do.

901
01:36:59,976 --> 01:37:01,394
Can we?

902
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:05,106
Sure, I just hope I can see to drive.

903
01:37:05,482 --> 01:37:07,692
Don't you worry. I can drive.

904
01:37:17,952 --> 01:37:19,662
Don't do that, Sonny.

905
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:21,539
Why not?

906
01:37:21,789 --> 01:37:24,042
We're man and wife.
We can do anything.

907
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,961
Not while I'm driving.
I might have a wreck.

908
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:31,674
Wouldn't it be awful if Mama
and Daddy got the police after us?

909
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:36,054
- They don't even know where we are.
- I had to leave them a note.

910
01:37:36,262 --> 01:37:39,849
- So they wouldn't worry.
- You shouldn't have done that.

911
01:37:40,058 --> 01:37:42,435
I figured they'd have
to know sometime.

912
01:37:42,644 --> 01:37:44,854
Well, what could they get us for?

913
01:37:45,063 --> 01:37:47,941
We got a right to get married.
Ain't we?

914
01:37:48,274 --> 01:37:50,026
I guess so.

915
01:37:53,238 --> 01:37:57,116
I wish you didn't have that
stupid eye patch. It's really creepy.

916
01:37:57,325 --> 01:37:59,494
I can take it off pretty soon.

917
01:38:00,411 --> 01:38:04,916
About two hours will be Lake Texoma.
Have a room to ourself.

918
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:08,711
My goodness. You're sitting so close,
I can barely drive.

919
01:38:35,697 --> 01:38:36,990
Oh, goodness.

920
01:39:00,388 --> 01:39:01,264
Howdy.

921
01:39:01,472 --> 01:39:03,808
- What part of Texas y'all from?
- Anarene.

922
01:39:04,017 --> 01:39:05,810
Newlyweds, ain't you?

923
01:39:06,394 --> 01:39:09,814
Y'all better follow me in.
Somebody's looking for you.

924
01:39:10,023 --> 01:39:12,859
We got a right to get married.
How can you arrest us?

925
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:16,404
I ain't arresting you.
I just want you to come with me.

926
01:39:16,612 --> 01:39:20,283
- I don't know what your rights are.
- I guess we better follow him.

927
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:23,745
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

928
01:39:28,499 --> 01:39:31,544
You think I worked hard
so Jacy'd end up in a pool hall?

929
01:39:31,961 --> 01:39:34,464
- We was gonna get an apartment.
- I'll bet!

930
01:39:34,672 --> 01:39:38,259
Where are your car keys, hon?
It's a hell of a note!

931
01:39:38,468 --> 01:39:41,137
- Shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

932
01:39:41,345 --> 01:39:44,932
You take her car.
As far as I'm concerned, he can walk!

933
01:40:13,503 --> 01:40:16,464
Not much of a wedding night, huh?

934
01:40:16,714 --> 01:40:17,757
Not much of one.

935
01:40:17,965 --> 01:40:21,427
Here. Have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

936
01:40:21,636 --> 01:40:23,679
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

937
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,517
You won't believe this...

938
01:40:27,767 --> 01:40:31,020
...but you're lucky we got you
clear of her quick as we did.

939
01:40:31,395 --> 01:40:34,482
You'd have been better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

940
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:36,859
Does everybody know about that?

941
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:38,319
Of course.

942
01:40:38,819 --> 01:40:43,157
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.
Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head.

943
01:40:43,407 --> 01:40:45,409
Well, she's prettier.

944
01:40:46,327 --> 01:40:50,540
I guess I shouldn't have, though.
I guess I treated her terrible.

945
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:52,208
Guess you did.

946
01:41:12,228 --> 01:41:14,355
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

947
01:41:14,564 --> 01:41:17,525
Oklahoma's not much
of an improvement.

948
01:41:22,947 --> 01:41:24,824
It's not the same now.

949
01:41:26,575 --> 01:41:29,662
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

950
01:41:35,293 --> 01:41:37,169
No, it hasn't.

951
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,425
Oh, God.

952
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:48,055
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

953
01:41:51,976 --> 01:41:54,061
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

954
01:41:55,855 --> 01:41:58,149
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

955
01:41:59,317 --> 01:42:01,402
I guess everybody did.

956
01:42:03,487 --> 01:42:06,782
Well, I'll tell you,
it was different with me.

957
01:42:07,116 --> 01:42:08,534
I loved him.

958
01:42:10,161 --> 01:42:12,121
He loved me too.

959
01:42:17,752 --> 01:42:21,505
Are you the one he used to take
swimming out at the tank?

960
01:42:21,714 --> 01:42:23,924
He told you about that, huh?

961
01:42:25,134 --> 01:42:26,677
Yeah, I was the one.

962
01:42:30,264 --> 01:42:33,142
I guess if it wasn't for Sam...

963
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:36,896
...l'd just about have missed it.
Whatever it is.

964
01:42:38,522 --> 01:42:41,817
I'd have been one of them
amity types that thinks...

965
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:45,738
...that playing bridge is
the best thing that life has to offer.

966
01:42:53,496 --> 01:42:55,581
Old Sam the Lion.

967
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:02,671
Nobody knows where he got that name.
I gave it to him.

968
01:43:03,339 --> 01:43:04,673
One night...

969
01:43:05,132 --> 01:43:07,426
...it just came to me.

970
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:13,682
He was so pleased.

971
01:43:17,186 --> 01:43:19,647
I was 22 years old then.

972
01:43:21,023 --> 01:43:22,566
Can you imagine?

973
01:43:26,779 --> 01:43:27,947
It's terrible...

974
01:43:28,155 --> 01:43:32,076
...to only meet one man in life
who knows what you're worth.

975
01:43:33,786 --> 01:43:34,870
Just terrible.

976
01:43:38,082 --> 01:43:39,583
I've looked too.

977
01:43:41,335 --> 01:43:43,754
You wouldn't believe how I've looked.

978
01:43:48,509 --> 01:43:51,679
Well, now I know.
That's why Sam liked you.

979
01:43:51,887 --> 01:43:52,930
Loved me.

980
01:43:53,138 --> 01:43:54,640
Loved you, I mean.

981
01:43:55,683 --> 01:43:57,059
Do you?

982
01:43:58,519 --> 01:44:01,313
I can kind of see
what he saw in you too.

983
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:12,950
Nope. I'll just go on home.

984
01:44:13,284 --> 01:44:14,618
Go on. Get out.

985
01:44:19,081 --> 01:44:22,334
Think I could learn to drink?

986
01:44:28,882 --> 01:44:31,552
You might.
Better keep on practising.

987
01:45:01,874 --> 01:45:04,209
That Logan boy's a quarterback,
ain't he?

988
01:45:04,418 --> 01:45:06,879
Boy, we've finally got us a team!

989
01:45:07,212 --> 01:45:09,298
Didn't back in your day, did they?

990
01:45:09,631 --> 01:45:11,133
No, we wasn't much good.

991
01:45:11,467 --> 01:45:13,761
You just never learned
the fundamentals.

992
01:45:13,969 --> 01:45:16,430
You know, blocking and tackling.

993
01:45:16,722 --> 01:45:18,265
Not like this team.

994
01:45:18,515 --> 01:45:20,809
- When was it you graduated?
- Last year.

995
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,144
You don't mean it.

996
01:45:22,394 --> 01:45:25,606
Seems longer than that
since you and Duane played ball.

997
01:45:25,856 --> 01:45:27,399
I seen Duane a while ago.

998
01:45:27,608 --> 01:45:29,985
He's home on leave,
wearing his uniform.

999
01:45:30,235 --> 01:45:32,196
I ain't seen him yet.

1000
01:45:37,618 --> 01:45:39,536
- How are you, Chester?
- Fine, coach.

1001
01:45:39,745 --> 01:45:42,915
See if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

1002
01:45:43,123 --> 01:45:47,461
You know a man never ought to cheat,
unless it's for a good cause.

1003
01:45:48,587 --> 01:45:50,506
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

1004
01:46:43,183 --> 01:46:44,685
Hi, Mrs. Jackson.

1005
01:46:44,977 --> 01:46:46,019
Duane here?

1006
01:46:46,353 --> 01:46:50,440
That's his car out there, ain't it?
He's here if he ain't walked off.

1007
01:46:58,448 --> 01:46:59,950
Hi, how you been?

1008
01:47:00,492 --> 01:47:02,035
Pretty good.

1009
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:07,374
I been thinking all week
that I'd run into you.

1010
01:47:10,085 --> 01:47:11,920
I heard you was going to Korea.

1011
01:47:12,129 --> 01:47:15,048
Thought I'd get over
and see you before you got off.

1012
01:47:16,049 --> 01:47:19,177
Glad you did.
I'm taking the bus in the morning.

1013
01:47:26,852 --> 01:47:30,355
Want to go to the picture show?
Miss Mosey has to close it.

1014
01:47:30,564 --> 01:47:33,984
- Tonight's the last night.
- Yeah, might as well go.

1015
01:47:34,234 --> 01:47:37,195
Hate to miss the last night.
Take the Mercury.

1016
01:47:37,571 --> 01:47:40,032
Be my last chance
to drive it for a while.

1017
01:47:46,413 --> 01:47:48,874
<i>- Ready, Matthew?</i>
<i>- All ready.</i>

1018
01:48:14,858 --> 01:48:16,777
<i>Take them to Missouri, Matt.</i>

1019
01:49:16,294 --> 01:49:17,796
That was a good movie.

1020
01:49:18,004 --> 01:49:19,965
Seen it here before once.

1021
01:49:21,133 --> 01:49:23,760
Let's run over to Wichita
and drink some beer.

1022
01:49:23,969 --> 01:49:26,388
Okay. I got lots of time
till morning.

1023
01:49:26,638 --> 01:49:27,889
Sure.

1024
01:49:29,724 --> 01:49:32,394
- So long.
- Sorry you're closing the show.

1025
01:49:32,602 --> 01:49:35,147
Nobody wants to come to shows no more.

1026
01:49:35,605 --> 01:49:39,276
Kid baseball in the summer,
television all the time.

1027
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:44,281
Sam had lived, I believe
we could've kept it going.

1028
01:49:44,781 --> 01:49:47,325
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1029
01:49:48,451 --> 01:49:51,705
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1030
01:49:54,249 --> 01:49:55,834
Well, so long.

1031
01:49:56,585 --> 01:49:57,627
Duane.

1032
01:49:58,879 --> 01:50:00,922
You watch out now, overseas.

1033
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:26,114
Sure weren't no women around.

1034
01:50:29,034 --> 01:50:31,953
I guess the next piece of ass
I get will be yellow.

1035
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,497
I wish I was going with you.

1036
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,835
Take care of the car for me.

1037
01:50:39,377 --> 01:50:40,837
Your ma don't need it?

1038
01:50:41,046 --> 01:50:44,174
I wouldn't want her driving it,
the way she drives.

1039
01:50:44,382 --> 01:50:47,344
You might help her take
the groceries home sometimes.

1040
01:51:00,565 --> 01:51:01,900
You ever...

1041
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:03,568
You ever hear from Jacy?

1042
01:51:04,444 --> 01:51:06,279
No, not a thing.

1043
01:51:06,529 --> 01:51:10,575
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1044
01:51:10,784 --> 01:51:12,786
I guess she always stays in Dallas.

1045
01:51:13,495 --> 01:51:15,288
Yeah, probably does.

1046
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:18,792
I guess there's lots to do there.

1047
01:51:24,547 --> 01:51:26,758
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1048
01:51:28,927 --> 01:51:30,845
No, I ain't over her yet.

1049
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,932
It's the damnedest thing.

1050
01:51:37,102 --> 01:51:41,648
That's the only reason you and I
got into it that time, you know.

1051
01:51:44,359 --> 01:51:45,819
Reckon she likes Dallas?

1052
01:51:46,778 --> 01:51:48,446
Hard to say. Maybe she does.

1053
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:56,162
Reckon you and her would've got it
straighted out if I hadn't butted in?

1054
01:51:59,374 --> 01:52:02,210
No, they'd have annulled me too,
even if we had.

1055
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:10,093
Y'all never even got into the motel?

1056
01:52:18,059 --> 01:52:20,603
Better get on before we both freeze.

1057
01:52:30,572 --> 01:52:32,323
Here are the keys.

1058
01:52:34,075 --> 01:52:36,411
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1059
01:52:37,453 --> 01:52:38,621
Be careful.

1060
01:52:39,372 --> 01:52:40,957
I'll take care of your car.

1061
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:43,710
See you in a year or two
if I don't get shot.

1062
01:54:19,639 --> 01:54:21,933
The trucker didn't have a chance.

1063
01:54:24,852 --> 01:54:26,854
I could see it wasn't his fault.

1064
01:54:30,525 --> 01:54:31,818
The sand was blowing.

1065
01:54:32,026 --> 01:54:35,238
I never noticed him.
Figured nobody'd be in the street.

1066
01:54:35,446 --> 01:54:37,949
What was he doing out there anyway?

1067
01:54:38,157 --> 01:54:41,035
He weren't doing nothing.
He's just simple-minded.

1068
01:54:41,244 --> 01:54:43,162
- Never had sense.
- Wasn't your fault.

1069
01:54:43,371 --> 01:54:44,914
Hell, no. I can see that.

1070
01:54:45,164 --> 01:54:46,791
He was just a dumb old kid.

1071
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:50,044
Didn't know enough to keep his ass
out of the cold.

1072
01:54:50,253 --> 01:54:52,213
Let's eat. Ain't had breakfast.

1073
01:54:52,422 --> 01:54:55,341
I'd like to know what
he was doing with that broom.

1074
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:58,344
He was sweeping, you sons of bitches!

1075
01:54:58,594 --> 01:55:00,304
He was sweeping!

1076
01:56:04,202 --> 01:56:06,746
Y'all got some crazy kids
in this town.

1077
01:58:40,232 --> 01:58:42,776
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1078
01:58:45,654 --> 01:58:47,031
I guess.

1079
01:58:55,915 --> 01:58:58,459
I'm sorry.
I'm still in my bathrobe.

1080
01:59:20,773 --> 01:59:23,150
What am I doing apologising to you?

1081
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,196
Why am I always apologising to you,
you little bastard?!

1082
01:59:27,404 --> 01:59:30,532
Three months I've apologised to you
without you even here!

1083
01:59:30,741 --> 01:59:34,286
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologising?!

1084
01:59:34,495 --> 01:59:35,996
You ought to be sorry!

1085
01:59:36,497 --> 01:59:40,584
I wouldn't be in my bathrobe if not
for you. I'd have my clothes on.

1086
01:59:40,834 --> 01:59:44,338
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not!

1087
01:59:45,798 --> 01:59:47,841
Just because your friend got killed...

1088
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:51,595
...you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right?

1089
01:59:51,804 --> 01:59:53,806
I'm not sorry for you.

1090
01:59:54,056 --> 01:59:56,558
You'd have left Billy,
just like you left me.

1091
01:59:56,767 --> 01:59:58,769
I bet you left him plenty of nights...

1092
01:59:58,978 --> 02:00:00,729
...whenever Jacy whistled.

1093
02:00:00,938 --> 02:00:02,940
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1094
02:00:03,482 --> 02:00:07,695
You thought I was so old and ugly
you didn't owe me any explanation.

1095
02:00:07,903 --> 02:00:09,738
You didn't need to be careful.

1096
02:00:09,947 --> 02:00:13,242
There was nothing I could do,
so why be careful?

1097
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:14,493
You didn't love me.

1098
02:00:15,327 --> 02:00:16,453
Look at me.

1099
02:00:18,455 --> 02:00:20,249
Can't you even look at me?

1100
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:34,388
See?

1101
02:00:35,806 --> 02:00:37,599
Shouldn't have come here.

1102
02:00:38,225 --> 02:00:40,227
I'm around that corner now.

1103
02:00:41,437 --> 02:00:42,855
You've ruined it.

1104
02:00:43,230 --> 02:00:45,399
It's lost completely.

1105
02:00:47,943 --> 02:00:50,988
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.

1106
02:02:35,717 --> 02:02:37,928
Never you mind, honey.

1107
02:02:38,762 --> 02:02:40,555
Never you mind.

1108
02:06:11,433 --> 02:06:12,475
