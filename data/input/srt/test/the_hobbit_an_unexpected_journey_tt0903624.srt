Are we? Are we at peace?

1635

Trolls have come down from the mountains.
They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1636

Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1637
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,604
Hardly a prelude to war.

beyond the evil of Smaug.

Something far more powerful.

call it Mirkwood.

Well?

...living in Dol Guldur.

1652
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,650
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1653

That's absurd.

1654
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,211
No such power exists in this world.

1655
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:12,530
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1656
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,320
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1657

1662
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:33,127
It's not that. It's his excessive...

...consumption of mushrooms.

1664
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,165
They've addled his brain...

1665

A relic of Mordor.

A Morgul Blade.

1679
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,283
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1680

...and all that he possessed and sealed it
within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

Deep within the rock they buried him...

<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2447
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:39,451
<i>Until we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2448
02:54:41,360 --> 02:54:43,488
<i>We lay under</i>

2449
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:47,202
<i>The misty mountains cold</i>

2450
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:51,560
<i>In slumbers deep</i>

2451
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:55,200
<i>And dreams of gold</i>

2452
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:00,249
<i>We must awake</i>

2453
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:04,124
<i>Our lives to make</i>

2454
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:10,160
<i>And in the darkness a torch we hold</i>

2455
02:55:12,200 --> 02:55:17,570
<i>From long ago when lanterns burned</i>

2456
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:22,249
<i>Until this day</i>

2457
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:25,567
<i>Our hearts have yearned</i>

2458
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:30,090
<i>Her fate unknown</i>

2459
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:34,643
<i>The Arkenstone</i>

2460
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:38,000
<i>What was stolen</i>

2461
02:55:39,360 --> 02:55:41,601
<i>Must be returned</i>

2462
02:55:57,560 --> 02:56:01,246
<i>We must awake</i>

2463
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,286
<i>And make the day</i>

2464
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:09,167
<i>To find a song</i>

2465
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:11,528
<i>For heart and soul</i>

2466
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:18,483
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

2467
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:22,523
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

2468
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:26,523
<i>Haven't seen the end of it yet</i>

2469
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:30,723
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

2470
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:34,882
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

2471
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:38,962
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

2472
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:42,849
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2473
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:48,441
<i>Till we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2474
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:52,526
Far away

2475
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:57,561
<i>From misty mountains cold</i>
